I've been looking through the various npms that mention MyQ and HomeKit to try and find a way to trigger flows when my garage door opens or closes, but everything I've found seems to just support querying for status and sending open/close commands.  I'd rather not have to poll my garage door every 30 seconds to be able to trigger flows to run upon open/close events.
A work-around to demonstrate what I'm looking for...  I was thinking that I could rig a hacky solution for this using the email notification.  I already have a mail rule (in Apple's Mail.app) to send an email to IFTTT when I receive an email from chamberlain.  I could setup a webhook post to webhookrelay in order to trigger a flow in nodered, but I don't like having to rely on Apple Mail running on an always on computer...
So, is there a homekit or myq node that can receive open/close events that I can use to trigger flows?
I have homebridge installed.  I can thus control my garage door with Siri.  There are 3 things that (can) happen when my garage door opens or closes:
Aside: I kind of also thought that by adding a homekit node that is configured to talk to homebridge, that I might be able to automatically create nodes that can send commands to homebridge so that I can control all the devices configured in homebridge.  That would be a bonus.  However, I tried out one of the homekit nodes and I'm not sure that they have the functionality I imagine they would.
Since I added the garage door to homebridge, I had the thought that there might be a homekit node I could add that could receive the event notifications from homebridge.
