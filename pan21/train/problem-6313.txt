If you're root on the box, and it seems like you are, build a directory on '/', which is sda1.  For this example, let's call it '/data/overflow'.  Then in your home directory, take some directory that's excessively large, move the data to /data/overflow, and use a symbolic link to point to it.
GParted Live will let you resize non-LVM partitions, theoretically without losing data, but 1. you wouldn't be able to use your server during this time and 2. like womble said, it's highly likely something could go wrong.
Create a Ubuntu Live USB stick, boot to it, and run GParted to accomplish your re-configuration.  I've found it to operate flawlessly to create, move, copy, and resize conventional partitions.
In theory, you could reduce the size of sda1, increase the size of the extended partition, shift the contents of the extended partition down, then increase the size of the PV on the extended partition and you'd have the extra room.  However, the number of possible things that can go wrong there is just astronomical, so I'd recommend either buying a second hard drive (and possibly transferring everything onto it in a more sensible layout, then repartitioning your current drive better) or just making some bind mounts of various bits and pieces out of /home into / to free up a bit more space.
