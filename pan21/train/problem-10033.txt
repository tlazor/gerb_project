If you are doing this from command line, try enabling 'hash' ('binary' is another one I always turn on).  This may generate enough traffic on the control port to keep it from timing out.
You may be able to get around this by enabling "Active FTP" on the VM system which hopefully will cause VMware to actively watch FTP sessions and keep the control socket alive so long as data is still flowing.
You could change the VMs NIC to bridged mode (instead of NAT) to sort out the host OS. Then, make sure your FTP client sends NOOP commands periodically to keep the command channel open. There are firewalls around which close the data connection, if they see that the command session is closed. Regardless if the data connection is idle or carrying traffic...
It's likely that it's the NAT state tables on the VM that are causing the timing out the control connection because of inactivity on that socket.
If the FTP server is Vista goto the FTP site properties and increase the timeout from 15 mins (default). How big is the file that you are trying to transfer?
It could possibly be any filtering device on the way between your VM and the FTP server. Most firewalls (including home routers) have a state table where idle TCP sessions are reset after certain timeout.
