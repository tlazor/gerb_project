The simplest way would be to change their SMTP address to something arbitrary.  They will still exist and the mailbox would still be accessible, but mail to the previous address(es) will start bouncing.  
In an active directory environment, this would mean opening Active Directory Users and Computers, right-clicking their account, choosing the "E-mail Addresses" tab, then modifying the list entries that match the type "SMTP." 
You can right-click on the user properties and go to Exchange General> Delivery Restrictions, here you can select to only accept messages from authenticated users, this means you won't get emails from outside but only domain users.
It will stop mail for that user and allow you to continue accessing the mailbox via sharing in exchange if you add yourself to the permission list. Re-enable the user if you want to access the mailbox via outlook web access or outlook. Also, you can remove the address e-mail address from the mailbox via user and computers under active directory.
