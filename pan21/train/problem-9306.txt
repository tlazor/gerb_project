I found having my own designated office with a door was nice.  I used my laptop at home, but used a terminal services session to work off of a lot.  We had a terminal services server, so I loaded Microsoft Office and other software I needed on it.  Created my profile on it and mostly worked off of that for the speed.  It was like working in the office.
We also had VOIP in the office, so I had a cisco phone on my desk at home with my work extension on it.  Being I had a firewall in my home with a site to site tunnel the one phone worked great.  Users calling me had no idea I was in my home office.
I worked from home a couple days a week for a year or so to help lower the amount of commuting days I had.  I agree with the first post, make sure to have a seperate comfortable room in the house to work out of to eliminate distractions.  Working at the kitchen table has to many distractions.
Between those three items, I was in serious good shape.  However sometimes there were those occasions where I would have needed to be in front of the server, but then I just called one of my counterparts.
