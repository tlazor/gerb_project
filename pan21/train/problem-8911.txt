all the cookies and pwds are saved in sqlite database file . when you delete cookies /pwords the approprate table entries are deleted in the sqllite file.
Sorry, your question is about a user-friendly approach, and my answer is that even the non-user-friendly methods may be unsecure depending on what level of security you need.
(I'm assuming Firefox really enforces that this database file will not contain traces of the stuff you have deleted.)
with the sqlite file, and securely delete the encryption key of the previous filesystem. Without the key then it's really garanteed never to be recovered.
Instead of deleting, what you will do is you will create a brand new filesystem with a brand new encryption key, copy the current profile from a mounted 
you can use ccleaner (you can find it with searching at google or you can downlaod it from filehippo ... ccleaner can delete all extra(temproary) information that stored in computer or just specific programs files like cookies of firefox or internet explorer ... (i do not understand whta you want exactly i mean if you want to erase all cookies etc. (for firefox) you can go to tools that select 'clear recent history' select everything from time range and also at bottom there is an options what to delete, select desired options then clear now thats all i guess you cleared all cookies etc.. ((but ccleaner is very useful program i am using that program for more then 4-5 years ;)
If it's really that sensitive to you, better mount /home/username/.mozilla directly as an encrypted filesystem (e.g. encfs or ecryptfs).
