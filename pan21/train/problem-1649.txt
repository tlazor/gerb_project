When buying hardware for ESXi, you need to check the Hardware Compatibility List, as it does not run on just any hardware (Hyper-V is a lot better for that).  I found that I had to buy another RAID controller, as the one I had was not compatible with ESXi.
My server runs on a three year old quad-core Opteron.  Having set up a few VMware systems for businesses, I really do not think you would need a dual CPU system for personal use, as that would only be needed with at least a half dozen concurrent users.
Another thing: using an SSD for ESXi seems like a big waste to me.  It can run perfectly fine from a USB flash drive.  My ProLiant even has a USB port on the motherboard especially for this.  The newer G6 and G7 generations have ESXi already embedded on SD cards.  Doing this leaves your hard disks purely for your virtual machines and storage vDisks.
I run up to six or seven VMs running at the same time, using an HP ProLiant pedestal server running ESXi, with 8GiB of ECC RAM, and it does not slow down (although most of the VMs would be idling most of the time).
I'd recommend you use ECC RAM, so you'd need a Xeon for that.  If you really think that you need two processors, for future upgrade, you could get a dual socket motherboard and only fit one Xeon.  You can also get the HP ProLiant ML350 G6 in this configuration.
