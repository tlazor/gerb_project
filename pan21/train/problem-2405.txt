We're pretty happy with our NSA4500 and NSA2400 pairs otherwise, HA works as advertised, as does the load balancing from multiple ISPs. The CLI functioanlity stinks, but the SonicOS Enhanced web GUI is better than just about any other firewall I've encountered. Configuration files are binary blobs, so you cannot edit them with anything besides the GUI. Just use good version control, and export your configuration blobs to SVN, Git, or whatever after every change.
I've had VoIP issues with a NSA 4500 - lots of out-of-sequence packets. Their version of QoS (called Bandwidth Management) was implemented for the SIP traffic but even a support call got nowhere. I finally just put our SIP vendor's box outside of the 4500 and the problem vanished. A quick google search will show that it's a pretty common problem. If you're going to run VoIP through it, you may want to look for a different solution.
A major gotcha with SonicWalls is currently IPv6 support. There is exactly one semi-supported release of SonicOS (5.5.6) that has any IPv6 features available at all. All later releases (5.8.x is current) have no IPv6 support whatsoever. Downgrades are not supported without rebuilding all of your confiugration. This is level of IPv6 support rediculous at this late date, and you shouldn't buy anything new from Sonicwall until they have IPv6 support in general supported release with reasonable feature parity.
I've been very happy with HA on all the sonicwall models we've used.  The closest match to your setup is a pair of NSA 4500s in our primary datacenter.  Once setup, HA has been rock solid.  The one item I'd note is be sure to setup individual management IPs in the HA setup.  It allows you to log in to the standby firewall without affecting the primary (staging firmware updates, for example).
