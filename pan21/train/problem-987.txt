Sometimes this command gets "stuck", meaning it starts eating machine resources until the entire machine is unavailable. Logging in to the machine can take minutes when this happens.
So ImageMagick has the "convert" command which I use for my (Linux) web platform to deal with image resizing and such.
I can't identify when and why this is happening, the system is slugish and stuck until I "killall convert", then all is well. This command is run thousands of times each hour so unless I would log each and every usage in some way, I can't say which one got stuck, unfortunately.
I would probably prefer solution number 2, since solution number 1 could still yield several such processes that each is limited, and stuck, and together they would still eat up my resources.
Just before invoking the convert command you can set a resource limit on the max CPU time the process can use, convert then will get killed automatically after exceeding the limit.
I have created a script that kills some processes listed in array, if CPU usage greater than XX% for YY seconds or kill processes that running more than ZZ seconds.
