to have something usefull i would recommend installing mercurial on the server in your home, maybe that local installation is less "complex" than the git installation (which you could also install in your home btw).
use rsync (oh, wait you would need rsync on the server as well :)) to just store the mercurial / git / bzr repos from your local machine onto the servers. you then have to download the whole repository next to your working copy and then you can do a merge.
I have ssh access to many servers where I have no root privileges. Do you know of any version control utility that can work with remote ssh repositories whichout installing anything on the remote server? 
In addition, you can also do "commit"s when your machine is not connected to the server by passing the "--local" option to the "commit" command, or by unbinding and binding the branch (bzr unbind/bzr bind)
Actually, the way this works is this: You create a repository/branch on your local machine and user Bazaar to track all changes. Bazaar stores all its information in a directory named ".bzr" in the root directory for that branch. You must upload the repository/branch to your server using your SSH access. Then, any latter changes commited to the branch are automatically uploaded to the server.
I have tried a bare git repository folder, but it seems to demand some script/binary/installation on the server.  I also dont like git because it is not very portable. The portable versions are made of too many files
It looks like Bazaar can use an SFTP-based “dumb server” (Bazaar not required on the server side) for read and write access.
As Chris Johnsen points out, Bazaar can upload the repository data to a server using different protocols, SFTP among them.
