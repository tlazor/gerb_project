Unfortunately I've never owned a Chromebook, but I've heard it supports android apps, so maybe you can find something in the App Store? I've tried some apps in the past like AIDE, which is used for android development, but I've only used it for testing, never for an actual release of an app. Although that was meant for android development with Java, not the best choice for a new person.
In theory, on any machine that you are allowed to display graphics, you can also display 3D graphics. Of course that means that if there are no tools/libraries to do the math for you, you'd have to do it yourself, which is not recommended for someone new to programming. Also if the software you are using does not support 3D graphics, you can still display them, but it will most likely not take advantage of the system's GPU, which means performance would be terrible.
Well, the question to that always is, start programming, pick a language, pick a tool/library for making games, and start coding. You don't have to make the next big hit to learn, start by making a broken game, understand the concepts of it, and how everything should work. You could for example try Python, using the Pygame library, which is mean for making games.
One could also argue that you can use a graphical engine, like Unity, which can take care some of the coding for you, until you are more comfortable with it.
Having said that, I've never used scratch.mit.edu, but from what I remember it doesn't support 3D graphics, although I could be wrong.
There are plenty of tutorials online, if you search on google something like "LANG tutorials" replacing "LANG" with the language of your choice, you can get plenty of free resources. From that point, it's like a musical instrument, the more you use it, the more sense it makes. Once you feel comfortable enough, you can move to the next step.
