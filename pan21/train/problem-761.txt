I believe the problem stems from VMware Server 2 being incompatible/buggy with glibc versions above 2.5-34.  I've experienced this from upgrading CentOS 5.3 to 5.4 and this bug has been documented in the CentOS/RHEL distribution. From reading your error log, the errors associated with libc.so.6 are very similar and I can only assume that it's affecting Ubuntu the same way. Try downgrading to an older version of glibc (it worked for me in CentOS+assuming it won't break other packages you have installed) or downgrading Ubuntu.
That might be a Virtual to hardware translation problem, as said Shadow00Caster, updating a 8.04 to 9.10 without recompiling should cause some trouble to the Operating system who not manage the request as the same way.
I had an issue similar to this when I upgraded an Ubuntu host running VMWare server.  I upgraded from 8.04 to 9.10 running VMWare server 2.0.2 and was having issues with a few Linux guests crashing constantly and windows guests not even running.  I did a little research around and found lots of people having issues on Ubuntu 9.10 after an upgrade but not a clean install.  My solution was to backup my virtual machines to a different location just to be careful and re-install VMWare server 2.0.2.  That worked for me, I believe the issue was that the 2.0.2 was installed under 8.04 which has different versions of core components and, at least on my server, was running an older kernel.
