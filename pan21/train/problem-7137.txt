So, my question is this: does anyone here know whether it's possible to coerce this EAS product into working correctly in Windows 7?
I work at a place that uses Exchange with Outlook for mail, and they also use a product from Zantaz called "EAS" which does server-side archiving of old messages.  One of the artifacts of this archival is that email attachments are missing from the archived messages when viewed in Outlook.  EAS has a client tool that plugs into Outlook that enables easy retrieval of those archived messages and their attachments, but it doesn't seem to work when installed on Windows 7.  I have no direct evidence of this, other than that it simply doesn't work on my Windows 7 machine, and some of our network support staff seem to corroborate this.  The symptom is that Outlook seems to know nothing of the existence of this EAS app.  The EAS app also has a system tray icon which is there and offers some minimal functionality, but the real goodness is the Outlook integration, which I sorely miss.
