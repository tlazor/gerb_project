Yes, they still install adware, or programs that claim to do something useful but silently install adware. They claim you can opt-out. They've claimed it before, but users had a different experience, as seen from the links in my Q. Maybe you can opt-out for real now, I don't know.
They said they stopped installing Conduit products and all toolbars. They won't provide the list of programs they do install (I'll update this answer if this changes). They do still install TuneUp Utilities 2014, which has bad rep on CNet and, according to wikipedia, silently installs adware. (Wikipedia does not say whether it uninstalls cleanly, including the adware; in the past, that was not the case with Dexpot's third pa>rty bundles, but this may have changed). They do allow you to opt-out of TuneUp, or so they say.
It's a good thing Dexpot maintains a forum and answers questions instantly if/when they choose to, but one difficult question (such as "do your programs ever call home?"), and they stop answering - this has been my impression from looking at the forums.
I'll stay away from Dexpot and stick to VirtuaWin until I can see if someone can get them to do a public statement about what the software does NOT do. (Think about it this way: would not a legit company be eager to make such a statement?)
