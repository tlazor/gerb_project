I created one version for a Virtual PC, so I basically ripped everything out of it, and got the final install size to under 300mb (and if I compressed the image with WinRAR, the virtual hard disc shrank to ~165mb - the same size as the ISO).  On my normal XP disc, which retains most functionality (including wireless), the install was about 400 to 500mb (without a pagefile!).
On top of the minimum 4 GB everybody is recommending, I suggest you leave a little bit more, just in case (about 1GB should be enough); it never hurts to have a bit of breathing room :)
A lot of stuff is done on the partition that Windows is on (think temporary files from all types of files). I once ran out of space while trying to extract a large set of files from an archive, even though I wasn't extracting to the partition Windows was on (but the unarchiver was saving some temporary files there). Also, a few programs, although installed on a different partition, copy some files to C:\Program Files\Common Files (that folder is taking up nearly 650 MB on my PC).
I always remove the stuff I don't need from Windows (e.g. firewall, defender, wireless services, indexing) to save space and increase performance (also, there's no point on keeping the Microsoft versions of software if you replace them with something else anyways).
I've installed a slipstreamed SP2 disk into a 4GB VM, and it had about 300MB of room free, so was slow and complaining. I wouldn't want to try in less than 4.
Have you ever heard of nLite?  Basically, it allows you to add/remove components to a Windows XP installation (e.g. drivers, applications, services), and create an unattended install if desired.
probably just about 2 gig. Windows XP SP1 disk says it needs 2 gig, SP2 probably a bit more, same with SP3 to be safe, I would give it 5
