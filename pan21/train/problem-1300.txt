The specs say max download rate is 38 Mbps, so 12 should not be difficult for it to handle. The important question is, when everything slows down, are you using the full 12 Mbps that your connection allows? You may very well be over-utilizing your connection.
These are all things that your ISP will likely have you test before taking action on their end, so it is a good idea to get it out of the way and take good notes. If you get to that last step and it is still slow, that basically takes everything on your side out of the picture and leaves the issue on the cable companies plate to deal with - give them a call then. 
There are multiple things that can cause a slowdown when it comes to cable (or DSL). Cable runs on a shared pipe as any other, so it is possible that the trunk is over-utilized. It is also possible that your own connection is simply over-utilized. It could also be a bad modem. It could be a problem between your router and your modem or your modem and the wall (cabling), or even your router.
Are you using the modem from another service? if so have you gotten the specs for this service to ensure you are using all the correct parameters?
If you connect the modem to different places in the house (say where the cable comes out on the other end, either at the side of you house, or in the garage) to see if it works better there?
Swap out all the cables you can, also connect directly to the modem and bypass your router. Do things improve?
