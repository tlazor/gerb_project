A quick and dirty solution would be PSList running every minute via scheduled task and dumping to a text file available via IIS.
This won't be possible, because windows uses authorisation on nearly every interface, also connection through an MMC snap-in will require authorisation.
You can enable non administrators to use the SCM or any other MMC snap-in by editing Group Policies. Maybe this Microsoft KB entry will help you.

How do I set up permissions so that they can at least list the services and see if they are running?
I'm trying to configure my Windows 2008 servers so that my developers can view their status without needing to log on to the box or be an admin. Unfortunately, the permissions set in Windows 2008 for remote non-admin users don't include the ability to enumerate or otherwise query services. This causes anything that contacts the SCM on the far end to fail (Win32_Service, sc.exe, services.msc etc).
