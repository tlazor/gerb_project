Right-click the host, properties>display settings: uncheck inherit from parent and check scale docked remote desktop to fit window
On v2.7 build 1406.0, not sure if this was released in an update, just wanted to point it out in case people are still searching.
A few days ago (no idea what happened), it stopped going to full screen properly. Now it only resizes to the full size of my screen minus the task bar (so I still see that and the RDCman's window is also not behind my local task bar. The blue bar at the top appears for a moment but I cannot get it back when moving the mouse there.
Otherwise, it seems Windows 10 keeps a bottom bar reserved for the taskbar & doesn't allow the remote desktop to go "all the way" Fullscreen.
This worked for me http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfnetwork/surface-pro-4-windows-10-remote-desktop-other/d17d4321-0f04-4a64-95b4-1c6dd5de9c91?page=1
I just resize the RDCMan window to "almost" maximum size, then hit Full Screen in the RemoteDesktop connection (right click-> Full Screen). 
I'm using the Remote Desktop Connection Manager 2.7 on a Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10. Until recently, it was working fine: It would go to full screen and show this blue full screen connection bar at the top when pointing there with the mouse. I could close the session from there or leave full screen mode.
