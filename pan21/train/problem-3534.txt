The solution I'm currently using is that I disable the AirPort (on the Network icon menu in the top bar), wait a few seconds then re-enable it. It then quickly works, but the connection still breaks after a few minutes.
My solution was then to change my router. I now have a Linksys WRT160N. So far, I never had any connection break.
I thought DHCP was the issue. So I tried assigning a fixed IP address (192.168.0.166). It successfully connects, but after a few minutes, the connection still breaks.
It seems that D-Link routers are known to be incompatible with Mac. At least one shop I know stopped selling D-Link routers because they had too much complains from Mac customers.
What I mean by "breaking" is that all requests, whether it is loading a web page, connecting to a share folder, connecting to my local router at 192.168.0.1, or pinging anything doesn't get through (time out). When in a "break" situation, I can see in the Network Settings panel that I still have an active IP, which I can successfully ping.
I have a MacBook Pro with OSX 10.6.3 (Snow Leopard). After connecting on a Wi-Fi network, the connection "breaks" after a few minutes.
Since the problem seems related to inactivity, a solution would be to keep a continuous Internet transfer, for exemple opening a web radio. For instance, when I turn on my computer, I open this link http://www.chyz.ca/lecteur-audio/webradio-hipe and since then, I didn't have any more problems.
I have this problem at home with a router D-Link DI-624 and at work with a D-Link WBR-2310, all with updated firmwares.
It is clearly not solving the problem, though. If the web radio closes its window, a connection break is likely to happen shortly after.
