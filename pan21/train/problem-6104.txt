Now go to FoxyProxy settings and configure it to use localhost:3333 as your proxy server. Voila! You can also use -D option to setup port-forwarding through the tunnel.
Firefox -> Foxyproxy (filtering on regex) -> HTTP proxy configured to send data to ppp0 -> VPN interface (ppp0).
I have a VPN which I want to route traffic for specific websites through. I know how to do it I just don't know which utilities to use and how to configure.
Absent that, if you have another HTTP/web proxy server available at the other end of the PPP connection, set up your proxy to forward all requests that that proxy-on-VPN server. That will cause all the connections to open across the PPP interface.
The squid recommendation is best, because what you need is a program that allows setting the outbound interface usage.
Of course squid is not really small footprint and can be daunting to configure, but the default config should be more then adequate for most uses.
I have Foxyproxy set up to use the HTTP proxy when it matches a pattern. The bit where I am stuck is getting a HTTP proxy that will send request out on a specific interface. I have tried 'tinyproxy' but it does not seem to take notice of the 'bind 192.168.100.170' which is the IP address of my ppp0 VPN interface.
