The solution is that you have to close out all your books before you can change this folder (File > Close Book.) It would be nice if Amazon had included this simple instruction in the dialog box!
I had downloaded about 6 books when I decided to change the location. The button was disabled. I removed the 6 books from the device (my laptop), then the button was enabled and I could select my second hard drive which has more room. That was an easy fix. 
I do not have a clue what step enabled it or why it was disabled in the first place, but I hope this helps you]
I just downloaded and installed Kindle for PC and under Tools > Options, there is a setting called content which allows you to change the folder.
Whether or not it's enabled requires selecting content. That is, you have to be in Library view, select All Items on the left, then open Tools -> Options -> Content and voila! Button enabled. This is terrible interface design, but at least we've figured it out.
(Incidentally, if you later open up a book for reading, and go to Options, it's disabled again. At least they're consistent...?)
All I did was log in to the kindle website and try to push a book from my archive (a dictionary that was delivered on the Ipad), it said delivered, I then went to the application and clicked the refresh button.
For some reason, it did not send the dictionary and I do not have it in the Kindle, but shortly after this, I went back in to options and the button was enabled.
