The updater deletes the reg key for running on startup once it loads. See http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/8/releasenotes.html 
If you look at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run keys, I'll wager you have at least a dozen programs listed there already.  It's standard practice.  It's certainly no less obscure than C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.
While users seldom look here, this is not what a developer or systems administrator would consider a "hidden" location.  It is one of the most commonly used methods to run a program at login or startup, and the only method to explicitly start a program only once.  
it's a setting within the flash player itself, which can be accessed in a roundabout way at that URL, which I found under the How do I change how often I receive notifications of updates? header of another link, but apparently as a new user I can't post more than one URL in an answer (because new users only use the internet one link at a time, I guess?)
