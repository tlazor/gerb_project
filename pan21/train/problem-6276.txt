Just in case someone is reading this later: With puppet you are able to define which version of package/software you would like to install with the "version => X.Y.Z" declaration.
There is a plugin to keep your infrastructure definition in Foreman, pretty much a serialized version of your data in Git, and upload (and change your infrastructure) changes. Maybe that'd be useful for you
I have just setup Foreman for the first time & am not sure how to go about putting all of my configurations under version control. I know I can use Git for each module I install on my Puppet master but would prefer a more holistic solution that encompasses not just modules but also what classes are associated with each host and any variables set on the hosts. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated along with related workflows. In case it's relevant, I do have GitLab setup as a central Git server on site and plan to setup a CI server such as Jenkins soon.
I am not sure if i understand your question but did you came across "puppet librarian" https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet? There you are able to define which versions/sha1 of puppet modules you like to use.
With foreman you should be able to view all classes along with any configuration variable assigned in the host details. See: http://theforeman.org/manuals/1.4/index.html.
