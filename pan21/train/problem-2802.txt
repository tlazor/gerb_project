The best "protection" is to use a quality supply - which your question seems to rule out. Interspersing a buck-boost regulator will provide no benefit.
Personally I normally run several Pi from a 5V switch mode supply (of the kind sold to power LED lighting strips). My tests on this indicate very good regulation, low ripple and noise, with the added benefit that it can be earthed. Even then I supply the Pi via the ÂµUSB socket (connected with decent sized wiring).
Bearing in mind the $35 cost of the Pi do you need additional protection? I have designed many PSU circuits over the years, but most cost an order of magnitude more than this.
The vast majority of cheap 5V plug packs (including those sold for use with the Pi) have poor regulation (for which the circuitry provides no additional safety) and almost no protection from mains induced transients. Indeed it is difficult to provide isolation in a double insulated supply with no earth - which is why so many people report tingling or shocks when using these kind of devices, and certainly not for the prices people are prepared to pay.
