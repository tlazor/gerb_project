If your AD controllers serve your DNS not only to the internal LAN, but also to the outside world (i.e. if they serve yourcompany.com to the whole Internet), change the setup: external DNS should be on separate machines, placed in DMZ.
So here's a quick background. Two weeks ago I started a new position as the systems administrator for an expanding health services company of just over 100 persons.  The individual I was replacing left the company with little to no notice.  Basically, I have inherited a network of one main HQ (where I am situated) which has existed for over 10 years, with five smaller offices (less than 20 persons).
I am still confused as why there are so many servers connected directly to the internet.  I am seriously looking to redesign this setup with proper security practices in mind (my highest concern) and am in need of a proper firewall setup for the external/internal servers along with a VPN solution about 50 employees.  Budget is not a concern as I have been given some flexibility to purchase necessary solutions.  I have been told Cisco ASA appliance may help.   
These things shouldn't normally have an external IP: Domino servers, AD controllers, web mail servers. I think employees should access them through VPN only.
