On ubuntu 18.04 and nginx 1.14+ .... As stated above by @Daniel , "I fully support the statement from Andrew" that "almost no one is providing support for SSLv2/3 or clients without SNI". 
If this is still an issue I recommend you remove (google it first!) letsencrypt and reinstall certbot. https://certbot.eff.org/ and leverage the /etc/nginx/snippets/ folder for includes in your sites-available /slash/ sites-enabled folders.
I'm not sure I'm articulating this well, but there was a time on 14.04 and 16.04 where we had to manually specify the ciphers. The defaults on more recent versions of NGINX caused redundancy and therefore threw errors. The new nginx cipher defaults, including for certbot/letsencrypt, on 18.04 are much more secure ... but they did require us to remove our custom cert restrictions. 
What did throw a lot of us for a loop was legacy code created such as includes /etc/nginx/custom-name-here/ or /etc/nginx/conf.d/ folder includes and added them in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and sites-enabled/example-org. Subsequent upgrades then caused errors as seen by "nginx -t"
