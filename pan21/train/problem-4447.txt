With only two days, stick to variants. VBScript works fine even though all it has is variants. Python is in effect much the same (dynamic typing where type is an attribute of the thing named rather than of the name itself) which is one of the reasons why Python has become more popular for teaching the basics of programming. By design, VBScript is a simplified version of VBA designed for light-weight programming. It is telling that when Microsoft developers were deciding how to create a streamline version of Visual Basic, they decided to just stick with variants. In 2 days you won't have enough time to delve into the semantic issues which type declarations would raise.
A compromise possibility would be to use Variant for non-object types but introduce Range and Worksheet variables for objects. The explicit declaration of these types might remind students that they need to Set the values of those variables rather than simply assign to them, and would also introduce them to IntelliSence.
If you go this route, I would recommend still emphasizing the importance of using Option Explicit and explicit Dim statements, even though they would be in some sense superfluous. You could at least mention other types, and tell the students that if they want to master VBA programming they will need to learn about such things.
