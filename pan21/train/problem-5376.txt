 I cannot keep him away from the system since I am away for work most of the times, and also cannot remove his account, for it's for his use too. I just don't want any such 'theft access' to my system.
This is the safest method involving a command line interface to reset password. OR you may try interrogating your brother. 
Now at this point I am very angry; my brother has been using some kind of 'command prompt' based software (I noticed one day) to reset or remove the administrative password.
But from sometime, I am noticing that every time I log in to my account, Windows doesn't prompt password for log in! Besides, new games and software are installed in it, which would, for sure require 'Administrative Rights' for installation. 
My main account (i.e., administrator) is protected by a password, thus if my brother wants to install any piece of software such as games, etc., it would require my permission.
I guess I know what he is doing if a command prompt window is involved. I also did it once to break into my school Server when the school lost its password. It is done through the recovery console command prompt and Windows cmd. 
Then I head to the User Account section and notice that I am still the administrator, although the password has been removed! Furthermore, I set the password, and after few days back when I again log in to my system, the password is removed, and a new game is installed.
But remember to go back to the recovery console command prompt and revert the filenames back to original i.e. utilman.exe--> cmd.exe, utilman.bak--> utilman.exe.
I've an old system at home in which I've installed Windows 7 Professional. I use it seldom, although it contains important data and software for my use. I've created two accounts in it- one is mine, that's default, and has administrative rights, and other for my younger brother (a guest account).
