A min-plus weighted automaton (WFA) is a nondeterministic automaton with a weight function that assigns each transition a weight in $\mathbb{N}$. The weights along a run are summed, and the value of a word is the value of the minimal accepting run of the automaton on it.
There is a straigthforward exponentially ambiguous automaton for this $f$: each time you see a $c$, guess if you go to a state counting $a$'s or to a state counting $b$'s.
Here is a natural candidate: the alphabet is $\{a,b,c\}$, and to a word $v=u_1cu_2c\dots cu_k$ with each $u_i\in\{a,b\}^*$, you want to associate $$f(v)=\sum_{i=1}^k \min(|u_i|_a,|u_i|_b)$$
In a beautiful paper, Kirsten and Lombardy show that deciding unambiguity and sequentiality (i.e. determinizability) for WFAs is decidable for polynomially ambiguous WFA (the general case has been open for years).
It should not be too hard to prove that only exponentially ambigous automata recognize this function $f$. As a very sketchy argument, consider the fact that between two $c$'s, you must either count the number of $a$ or the number of $b$, so you need two different states to do so. Since you must be able to oscillate between these states, it means that you have distinct paths of the form $p\stackrel{w}{\longrightarrow} p$ for some state $p$ and word $w$ (containing some $c$'s).
Note that by "equivalent" we mean that they represent the same (perhaps partial) function $f:\Sigma^*\to \mathbb{N}$.
