I know for sure people do these things (Netflix, Amazon, Google) but I'm honestly not sure where to begin learning how. Any tips are appreciated.
I'm completely new to working with databases (other than retrieving data from them as a front end developer.) and have an idea I was toying with. However, I'm struggling to find exactly what to Google due to my lack of knowledge of DBs and the terminology surrounding them. 
I have a database that houses user's ratings of various items. One user can have one rating per item and can rate as many different items as they want. The goal would be to find other users who have similar items rated similar ratings and use their data to recommend new things to the first user. This means any single rating has some level of reach to every user in the database. (A similarity score of some kind). I.e. when I say I like item 1, the ratings of anyone else who liked item 1 are now of higher value to me. And anyone who didn't like it, their ratings are of lesser value to me.
