I assumed, initially this is because of skype, I use skype chat for work often, so when I boot this, possibly it needs to download and save all that, etc. Initially Skype was high in the Resource managers list so I closed that and now only open as needed. This has not fixed it however. I think now it might be due to my 2 gmail tabs that stay open. However the top of the list for most of the time is the very descriptive "System" so not sure what to do there.
I have a few months old (~8) gaming laptop running Windows 8.1, and I do not use it often, few times a week perhaps. I have noticed that when I resume it from standby (or hibernate mostly) for the first few minutes the Disk utilization on the task manager saturates at 100%. In the "Resource manager" this appears to be called "Highest active time"
I think this should not last this long, so I am worried if this is a problem I should be worried about. The issue fixes itself few minutes after boot, so Ive just let it be.. but I was wondering if there is a fix.
