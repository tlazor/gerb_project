You'll connect your VPN VM to both vSwitches and configure routing through it. This way, you'll tunnel to a VM that has access to both the public network (so that you can VPN into it) and the private network so that your VMs aren't exposed to the outside world unnecessarily and you won't need public IPs for all of them.
In the ISP space, deploy an OpenVPN server (preferably running on Linux due to small footprint). This OpenVPN server will have two NICs, one of them will have a public IP and the other will a private IP on the same subnet as the ESXi server. The ESXi will have no public IP assigned to it, but all traffic to the internet will be routed via the OpenVPN server that will act as a gateway. 
My firm does this all the time with virtualized firewall endpoints... We're a private cloud provider, so this is a realistic scenario.
When an admin  wants to connect to any of the ESXi VMs, he will first connect and authenticate to the OpenVPN server using its public IP, which will then grant him access to the remote private subnet. Once connected to the VPN server, he will then connect to the ESXi server using its private IP address.
