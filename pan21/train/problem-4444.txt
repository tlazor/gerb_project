Try going through monitor test pages at http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/ and see if you can achieve 1:1 native pixel mapping from your display adapter to monitor display.
Try to look at user manual of the TV or search internet forums for tricks to get TV to accept native resolution. Technically the only correct solution is to set both graphics output of your computer and the TV to "overscan: 0%" setting. This may be tricky for some TVs; for example, one Samsung TV model required image source to be connected to HDMI2 connector (the TV had 4 HDMI inputs) and the connector had to be labelled "PC" (instead of, say "PS3") for the magical overscanning and image processing circuit to switch off.
Some "monitors" that really are TVs have braindead logic of always applying analog TV era -overscanning to digital inputs, too. Such displays can never ever display sharp image from any source. (The whole analog overscanning was an artefact of less-than-perfect tube drivers, and later lazy TV stations not bothering to render the image correctly to the edge because "all viewers are overscanning the image".)
