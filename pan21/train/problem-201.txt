I'm being asked to downgrade some non critical database environments from Enterprise Edition 2012 to Standard Edition 2012. Due to ongoing licensing costs. 
Is there a process similar to upgrading I can do? Can I just run the standard edition install as an upgrade?
Copy the master, model and msdb data and log files to a secure location. You'll need these later so you don't have to recreate all the jobs and logins.
You can also run the following query to check for any version specific features you are currently using:
First, before doing anything, get a quick configuration report. You'll want to put everything back 'as is' when you configure your new Standard installation. Here's a useful script I use to get some key configuration settings - feel free to amend:
Are you using any Enterprise specific features, such as partitioning, snapshots, some aspects of Always On Availability Groups, Resource / IO governance, compression...?
I do not believe there is a "downgrade path" that's officially supported for what you want to do. Nothing that is full proof or baked in, in other words. I would take full backups of all databases, then uninstall and reinstall (also reinstall required SPs). Microsoft's supported upgrade paths: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143393.aspx
You can not perform a downgrade in the same way SQL Server allows you to do an in-place upgrade, so you're stuck with having to manually move your database(s) between two installs. If you've got a named instance, you'll need to back it up, perform an uninstall of the Enterprise edition, and a fresh install of Standard - restoring the databases thereafter.
