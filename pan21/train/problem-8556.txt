Any way if you have not been plugging anything in your modem I don't think there should be any problem removing it.
connect 2 pc's in a place where you only have a local PBX between the 2 places but no way to get ethernet passed (in one wierd sittuation it was quite ok
This might sound like a stupid question, but when I'm upgrading my pre-built computers, I always have to remove a pre-installed PCI (or PCI-E x1) modem to make room for other parts. So I'm wondering - what are all the possible uses of having a modem installed in a machine? There seems to be one and two port variants - what are the differences?
Once upon a time, in a land before 'broadband' was a word most people had heard of before, and modems connected to either serial ports or ISA slots, there were different versions of end-user modems. These days everything is a Hayes command-set modem. Their original use has largely gone by the way-side, though there are still some blighted corners where dial-up is still the only reliable internet access method. They still remain useful for that last bastion of analog inter-machine communication: Faxing.
You can do other things with them depending on the software you have. For instance, you can monitor Caller-ID information.
