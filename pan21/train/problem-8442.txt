And the next question, might sound silly, but are you sure you are doing a shutdown and not a sleep?
So that is one answer - that manufacturers have set the BIOS autostart on weekdays as the default.  Exactly how widespread this practice is, and when they started doing that, is a curious question.
At my workplace, I fully shut down my Windows 8 machine each night before going home. The last couple of mornings, it was turned on when I arrived. Is there some kind of Deep Magic that Windows 8 can use to turn itself on, or is this a clear sign that someone has been turning on my computer before I get to it?
As for what is causing your machine to wake up, its hard to say.  Check your Windows system event logs and see if there are any entries after the time you leave till the time you get in that look pertinent.  Your BIOS, might also have some information in its logs.
I noticed the same behavior on Dell OptiPlex 740 machines that I worked with.  Since I had started out with Windows 7, I also had no way to distinguish if it was an OS thing.  Someone figured it out how to turn it off here:
No, Windows cannot, but BIOS level functions can. Some more sophisticated BIOSes support wake timers (computer wakes up every morning at 6AM), and some peripherals can wake the system as Darius mentioned. Otherwise when Windows is not booted, no, there is nothing it can do to effect its power state.
There are a handful of ways a machine can turn itself on from on "off" state.  Firstly, modern PCs never truly are off.  See ACPI for more information.  The computer hardware (not the OS) is checking to see if you press the power button.  Other devices can send ACPI signals, such as keyboards with power/sleep buttons.  Computer BIOSs can turn a computer on after recovering from a power loss, which is good for machines that need to be on all the time.  Wake on LAN (WoL) is another method which can cause a machine to power on.
