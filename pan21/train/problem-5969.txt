A customer recently tried this with a computer which had a local windows (Win7) username and password that wasn't recognised by the NAS. Even though the NAS had write permissions enabled for everyone - so the user could create files on the NAS - when SQL server was given that username and password, the server couldn't write to the NAS. Error thrown was 1317 "The specified account does not exist."
Given that SQL Server Express can only hold a very small amount of data, 4 Gigs I think, using a shared NAS is probably overkill for storage.  As to why it would work for a person and not for an account when using the same credentials, no idea.  You'd have to talk to the NAS vendor (or at least identify them) to figure that out as it's the NAS which is rejecting the connection.
We use MS SQL server express 2008 R2 to store data for our application. Recently, we've started storing the databases on a shared NAS drive. Previously, we had the sql server "log in as" built in account: local system - because our database were stored locally. To make it work with the NAS we had to change this to "this account" and have the installer enter a username and password. This makes install more complicated, as they have to know a suitable account and pw.
My question is why can a user who is logged in on a paticular username write to a NAS, but, SQL, using the same username can't? Is there a workaround? (this would be useful when we want to do quick demos)
