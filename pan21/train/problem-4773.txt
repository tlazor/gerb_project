This is entirely possible with GlusterFS. I'm surprised nobody has mentioned it so far. If you look at the distribute connector, it does exactly what you describe.
I don't know of any way to do this easily. Are you just trying to make really big storage available? If so, this would be a complicated way to achieve it, and in most tasks for IT complication is bad down the road.
Your best bet with trends in pricing is to just buy really big hard disks for the NAS to create the desired storage space. Attempting to combine separate NAS device storage will be hindered by network speed or interconnect speed as well as increase failure probability as if any component in the NAS device dies, you lose part of the volume.
One portion of your question troubles me - why do you want a certain storage volume (whether it's on one NAS or somehow on multiple NAS units), why do multiple servers need access to the same volume? The easy answer is "use NFS" - does that not meet your needs?
The way I'm thinking about doing it is to combine (n) NAS(es) into one logical unit or drive then have my servers mount that drive to share the total aggregate space. (the servers are running Linux)
