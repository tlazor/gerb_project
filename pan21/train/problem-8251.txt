It's not a requirement, but I would lean towards only using 1 raid controller per disk array. if you want to use another sata stand alone disk, plug it into the mobo, or get another drive controller. I would only have my raid controller control my raid array. I bet your problems would disappear after you moved the stand alone disk off the raid controller.
Are you sure it's a RAID0?  Given the sizes you mention of your partitions, you have 297GB of usable space.  Dell didn't ship that with 300GB SATA disks, at least according to this.  I'm going to bet that you have 3 160GB SATA disks in a RAID5 with one disk failed.  A failed drive in a RAID5 array with a "driver-based software RAID implementation" would peg the CPU on your machine to the point of pain during reads.
I bet if you tried the same file transfer to remote disks you'll have the same performance problems.  
CERC == "Cost Effective Raid Controller" which I'm learning means something along the lines of "driver-based software RAID implementation."
