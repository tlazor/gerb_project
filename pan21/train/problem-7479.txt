I was wondering if it was possible to remote from a WORKGROUP PC to a domain-joined PC, using only the local credentials of the domain-joined PC. I know this is definitely doable through PSExec, thought in this situation the domain-joined PC has the local administrative shares disabled, and as such PSExec is not a usable solution. In this sort of situation, is remoting from a WORKGROUP PC to another PC using the local credentials of the other PC a possible thing?
Having remote administrative shares disabled unfortunately complicates matters, though it is company policy (don't ask me why, no clue). I can netsh the machine remotely so I don't believe it's anything to do with the network configuration, so I'm just looking for any sort of solution or workaround that will allow me to remote to a domain-joined PC using that a local user account on that PC remotely from a WORKGROUP PC. I don't necessarily want an interactive session such that PSExec can create, simply to execute commands remotely.
I have attempted sending remote commands through Invoke-WMIMethod, and have added the client PC to the TrustedHosts list, to no avail. I'm able to connect to the domain controller using a domain administrator account, though I want to be able to connect to a domain-joined account using the local details for the remote PC. I have also tried Invoke-Command through PowerShell, also to no avail, and Enter-PSSession.
