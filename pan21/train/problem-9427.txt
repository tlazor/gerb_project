I noticed that when the server is running backup (copying files from its own storage to another network location) or I have multiple clients downloading ISOs (4.8GB each) the transfer speed gets significant hit.
I am running Windows Server 2008 R2 Server edition on a server that has 2 identical Intel 1000MB network interfaces. Is there any way to link these in order to improve network copy over LAN? 
This is called NIC teaming and is hardware/software based, not Windows based. You'll need to get the correct software for your hardware configuration (For example use Broadcom Advanced Control Suite if you have Broadcom NetXtreme adapters). If you tell us your hardware configuration we could provide more info, maybe.
Windows 2012 is the first Windows OS that has a link aggregation method rather than using the NIC driver set, but you're on 2008r2, correct?  Intel was one of the first to have link aggregation capabilities (for their server adapters) and you'll need to choose the appropriate mode based on your switch partner and directional throughput needed.

There is a way around using the NICs as a team, but if you're already using both nics it's probably what you're using. This blog covers the various setups at a high level:  http://blogs.technet.com/b/josebda/archive/2010/09/03/using-the-multiple-nics-of-your-file-server-running-windows-server-2008-and-2008-r2.aspx
