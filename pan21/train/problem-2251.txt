Query store uses the query hash to identify and group queries together. If you're seeing a new plan ID every time this proc executes, it could be because you have a different SQL hash each time maybe because of dynamic SQL. Without seeing the code it is difficult to determine why.
This should force the use of the old CE and return your query to more predictable performance levels, however, you should also look at tuning and refactoring your stored procedure to identify the cause of the poor performance with the 2014+ CE and resolve it if possible.
You should check your cache for recent executions of this procedure and verify if they have different query hash values as this will be impacting Query Store's ability to track that query's executions.
To force the old Cardinality Estimator, you can add OPTION(QUERYTRACEON 9481) to your queries to force the use of the old pre-2014 cardinality estimator. In SQL 2016 SP1 and higher, you can also use OPTION(USE HINT('FORCE_LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION')) which does the same thing but doesn't require permissions to turn on trace flags.
