I'm pretty confident this is a configuration issue, probably related to AddHandler.  The output you provided as @Vladimir Blaskov also pointed out indicates apache doesn't think this is a cgi.  You mentioned other CGIs that are working, are they also called .cgi?  Or are they just in the directory that allows ExecCGI with no suffix?  Also from the docs:
The way you've configured the ScriptLog should be printing info.  If I were in your situation I'd check a couple things:
It looks like you have AllowOverride turned off for this directory, but perhaps the apache configuration allows it for other directories higher up?  In that case make sure you haven't disabled ExecCGI or have any .htaccess files in any directory above the nginx sbin.
then see if that prints anything related to why that file or directory isn't being handled as a CGI.
If none of that points out the problem I'd probably strace apache after setting it to only run a single child and seeing the output of a working CGI vs a non-working CGI to see what the issue is.  This sort of test would expose if maybe there is a configuration issue with the logging so that apache isn't able to write out helpful messages to the CGI log telling us why it refuses to play ball.  Hopefully you don't get all the way down to this part before fixing it, if you do I'll be really curious what the diagnostics showed.
