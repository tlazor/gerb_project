i am a bit desperate here, and sort of disenchanted about the possibilities of defining keyboard layouts in linux (ubuntu 10.04 here). there does not seem to be any easy, graphical way to define keyboard mappings (except for keyboardlayouteditor, but frankly, i do not understand the installation description. install antlr? cairo? pango? gobject?? generate grammars?? wtf???). 
adding to my distress, i find the chinese IMEs a horror (not a single one of the many i tried does anywhere come near google pinyin for windows), and have gotten neither ibus nor scime to work in a satisfactory way for me. 
i find linux keyboard handling a morass. i know this must be one of the hardest problems in computer science, since this subject gets so convoluted no matter whether its on windows or in-the-browser javascript. as a linguist i am well aware of the inherent complications proper text handling poses, but looking at descriptions how to configure xkb makes building interstellar spaceships look like a cakewalk.
run xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap and now this button with keycode 191 should be mapped to F13 or whatever you mapped it to.
i am using an apple aluminum keyboard with a german layout, but no matter what i do the (<>) and (^Â°) keys are always swapped (i did manage to change the default behavior for the f1...f12 keys from multimedia back to 'ordinary', application-centric... all you have to do is add the line echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode to /etc/rc.local... this is so bloody obvious i am ashamed i had to search the web for this!).
