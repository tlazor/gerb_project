Having worked on several indie projects (none of which have seen the light of day), I'll say that making a working game is easy. Making a polished, releasable game that is fun is a nightmarish slog of hard work.
Furthermore, knowing how to market your game and get enough exposure such that your game is profitable is more about experience than anything else.
If you check out sites such as GameDev.net or Tsumea.com, you'll see very few job openings that don't requisite years of experience and/or published titles.
That being said, getting into the industry is nigh on impossible, especially if you're not in a game developer hub city. Here in Brisbane, Australia for instance, most would-be developers have no choice but to go indie, because there just are no job vacancies in-industry. 
Designing a game that manages have both widespread appeal, and a unique selling point, involves more knowing what has failed than what could succeed.
While it is increasingly easy to make a game these days without any prior industry experience, it's the little things that seem to require industry insight.
