Also, you should have use SQL Server Profiler if you really wanted to rerun a bunch of transactions. However, you've poorly planned this, so you'll be out of pocket.
Go buy third party software to get the transactions, since RESTORE LOG is apparently not compatible with your changes (as originally suggested).
You also can't replay them on the same database, if that gets modified; i.e., you can't restore the database from an old backup, bring it online, make any modification at all to it and then replay the logs against it; you actually lose any log-replaying capability as soon as you bring the database fully online (there's even a specific flag in SQL Server restore operations for that).
Transaction logs contain the binary deltas of modifications applied to a database since the last log truncation; the keyword here is "binary": they don't contain SQL queries or something similar, but are actually more akin to binary patches to be applied to a program.
For this reason, they can be replayed only on the exact physical database files they were originally linked to; replaying them on another database (even with the same schema) would be exactly like applying a patch to a different executable to the one it was written for: not possible at all.
