How can I diagnose the root problem (regarding strange internet connection issues that affect just one machine)? Bonus points if you can tell me how to fix my problem. 
I'm having a very annoying internet issue with my Macbook Pro.  The typical scenario goes like this: I attempt to browse to a website I don't visit very often and the browser just waits forever and nothing appears.  The blank page will spin forever, sometimes successfully loading the title, often loading nothing.  Occasionally if I wait a while the page will load (or at least the title will appear).  If I turn off the laptop's wifi I often see a half-loaded page; turning the wifi back on again and refreshing is usually allows me to load the whole page in another second or three.   Pages that I visit often, such as gmail or this site, load fine and update their content easily (they're probably caching nicely, I'm assuming).  Sometimes the laptop surfs fairly well, without issue on any sites.
Does that return the same results as other computers on your network?  Usually when the first entry is invalid it needs to timeout before it can go to the next resolver.
