The downside is that you have to buy special furniture to support this. You might want to think about getting them a wireless keyboard and mouse if you decide to do this.
This has the advantage of allowing the system to remain on and prevents you from installing anything.
You could do this the other way around where the supervisor unlocks the machine and then allows the user to log in. I don't think the windows log in has support for easy two factor authentication. What you can do is encrypt the hard drive using something like truecrypt. When the system boots, it would ask for a password which the supervisor knows, and then it would boot into windows and allow the end user to log on normally.
The downside of this solution is that the machine would have to be turned off after the user is done or they would be able to log back in without the supervisor approval. That could be fixed with a scheduled task for the middle of the night though.
Another, lower tech option, would be to have a locking cabinet that the keyboard and mouse would be placed in when the user was done with the system. If you disable the USB ports or lock up the machine in a security cabinet, then you have a way to limit access.
