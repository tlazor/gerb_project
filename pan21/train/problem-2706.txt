The new operator is how all new instances of objects are created. AddForce() requires a Vector2 for its first parameter. One could create that vector earlier, like:
The "dot operator" is used to access members of a type (or namespace, but that isn't the case here). The type of variable Body2D has a collection of functions and properties, and the dot operator is used to access them -- in this case, to access and call the AddForce member function of whatever Body2D's type is.
It sounds like the tutorials you are following assume a certain level of familiarity with the C# programming language used by Unity that you may not have. You may want to take a break from those tutorials to read a little bit about the language itself outside the context of Unity. The MSDN has some reference you might find helpful. At the very least you should consider looking at this material concurrently with the Unity tutorials.
The () in this case represent the invocation operator. They exist to indicate that the expression is a call to (an invocation of) some function, with parameters specified in between the opening ( and closing ). When you define methods, they're used to indicate what the parameters to that method (if any) are.
