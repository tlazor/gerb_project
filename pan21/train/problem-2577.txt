This sounds like a stupid question but when posed with it on an exam yesterday, I wasn't entirely sure how to answer...I mean I know you have to put indexes on certain fields to speed up slow queries, and I know you have to make sure to load test it to 
Tuning is a balancing act - you have to compare the expense involved with 'tuning' against the expense involved in 'not tuning'.
I know it has the end goal of making the database faster for read / write access from it's users but the test had alot of ways of putting this:
Database tuning is an expense in itself.  It costs money to tune.  That's where the 'reasonable' part of my statement comes from.  
Does it make sense to spend 40 hours to tune something that runs every second million of times a day?  Probably.
I think searching the Internet for 'What is the purpose of Database Tuning?', you'd find statements similar to this Wiki article.
"So, why am I doing this??? Because of this. And why is that important??...", I think you'll ultimately come down to 'money'.
results are an expense.  Tuning 'may' allow us to reduce memory, cpu and disk space requirements, saving money.
