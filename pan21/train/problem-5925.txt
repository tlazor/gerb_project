Is there any preferred 3D software for realistic faces and animations? Is there a preferred format to export these faces and animations in?
Well faces are generally scanned in and then mapped to heads for 'realistic faces' and then for their facial expressions, they can either be mocapped or done by hand (which is not as pretty but cheaper). However, both take a fair amount of time and mocap costs a lot of money. Facial animations i think generally use more precise vertex based animation but you could probably rig the lips to bones if you don't care about being super accurate. I think there are some professional packages for face modeling, try googling around for your favorite 3d editor. Also, game engines sometimes have their own facial modeling software, for example, face poser in source games.
If, however, you do not work for an AAA-studio and you want some simple facial animation for your characters, look into morph targets. Create a bunch of facial expression (one for each consonant, for instance) and blend them dynamically, based on the lines of dialog.
Most games using facial animation use something called morph targets. NVIDIA has a great implementation available on their website.
I'm interested in being able to create realistic faces and facial expressions for the 3D characters of a game I'm working on. Think something similar to the dialog scenes in games like Mass Effect.
Facial expressions and mouth movements usually use a facial animation middleware of some sort.  FaceFX is one (Mass Effect used it), and incidentally I used to work in the very same building as some of the guys from OC3 Entertainment, who put it out.  I believe in many if not most cases these middlewares do processing on the voice file to generate most of the mouth animations to sync up, perhaps with cleanup by a human afterward.  The expressions are most likely scripted, and perhaps blended with the mouth animations at render time (to avoid storing a million distinct animations to disk).  I'm sure you can learn more by going on the FaceFX website.
Unfortunately I'm not sure where to begin. I'm sure the faces/animations are created through 3D Modeling software, but otherwise I am lost.
However, I would say all AAA-titles use motion-captured (mocap) actors for cutscenes. They are expensive to do, but cheaper than having an army of artists create facial animations by hand. Mocap also has the advantage of looking a lot more life-life, depending on the amount of control points on the actor's face. 
If you want to get similar results yourself, you're probably in for an uphill climb.  It's typically not something you do on your own if you have a large amount of animating to do (As Bioware did with the ME games).  However, if you're closer to Call of Duty or some such where you have only a few minutes of dialogue which needs very realistic movements, hand animating might be cheaper or give a better result.  Not sure.
