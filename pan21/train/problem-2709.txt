I don't think you will be able to do this with a pivot table as the filtering is not that advanced on the grouped items.  Or at least it isn't that automated.
I was able to do this with an SQL query.  You can query Excel from Excel using MS Query and a data connection (simply point the datasource to the file you are working on).
I would start one Query called Fruit, and Filter on category = fruit.  Then I would start another Query called Vege, and Filter on category = vege. Then in the Vege Query I would add a Merge command to join to the Fruit query using the Item columns, keeping rows that don't match.  Then I would use the Expand command to add a column from the Fruit query e.g. Item.  Then I would Filter on that new column, keeping only the Null rows.

To answer this Question, first let's look at the typical pivot table. There's the table generated from the data and there's the pivot table field list.  To do what you are asking go to the pivot table field list and where you see category place the cursor over that then you will see a small upside down triangle the right.  Click on the triangle.  This will open up a pane with Filter options. In the bottom of the pane click the top box effectively unchecking all of them, then search for the one you want... in this case that would be clicking the zucchini and onion.
