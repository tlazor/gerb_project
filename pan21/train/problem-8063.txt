Modern x-ray machines pose no risk at all to magnetic media, they haven't since the early 80's in fact. What could still be a minor risk are the hand-held scanners that officials use on people but you really should have put anything that you care about in the tray by that point anyway. I have put a variety of laptops, iPods, cameras, camcorders etc. through airport x-ray machines well over a hundred times over twenty years with no issues whatsoever. Of course the proof is that there's no warnings about it being dangerous, no airport in their right mind would risk the law suits against them of not displaying if it was dangerous but they hadn't signposted it heavily. Enjoy your flight.
Try to act like a terrorist.  Then they'll know you're not really a terrorist, because no real terrorist would actually act like a terrorist.  Real terrorists would act like they are not terrorists, and the TSA knows this, so if you are trying to act like you are not a terrorist they will naturally assume you are one. :)
I suspect that it may be cheaper to buy a ATA-approved shipping container and send the computer via UPS/FEDEX.  I've sent computers overseas this way before.  I think we got our shipping container from Time Motion Tools -- or one of the other tool vendors.  Try Google with "computer shipping containers."
