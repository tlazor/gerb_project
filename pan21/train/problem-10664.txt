You didn't give a lot of information about tools you're using to troubleshoot this, so I'll describe the approach I take when I encounter a problem like this. Hopefully this will help you find the solution:
If the delivery status is anything other than delivered, I would look at any transport rules hit and the final status to identify what was done with the email (dropped, quarantined, redirected, etc.). If that doesn't get to the bottom of the issue, I would (reluctantly) create a service request with MSOL support.
If the message has a status of Delivered, I would be looking at mailbox related things. I always use OWA for this because I can verify that the mail exists in the mailbox before checking any clients that could potentially have communication or offline copy issues. I would be looking at inbox rules, junk mail, "Clutter" (the new feature), deleted items, recoverable deleted items.
Since you've established that email can be delivered between the two Exchange orgs in general, I would run a message trace in O365 against the recipient's primary address (not the alias). This will tell you what, if any, transport rules were hit on the way through. Most importantly, it will tell you the final delivery status.
