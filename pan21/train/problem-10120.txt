Formatting your hard drive does not involve doing anything mechanically different compared to reading or writing to disk.
Technically, any use of a drive shortens the MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure, I think). But, as someone said, nowadays that's a huge number. Drives aren't guaranteed beyond that. But they will all eventually fail with use from simple wear and tear; they have moving parts and spin platters at incredible speeds and high temperature.
Low level formats aren't possible on new drives; bad sectors are mapped out by the firmware. Each cylinder of a disk has extra sector(s), and when a sector begins to fail, it is moved to the fresh sector and re-mapped. When the extra space on one cyl fills up (drive is really going bad) it borrows the next cyl's space. I'm not sure what that means to the defragment programs, but I assume they handle it properly or are completely blind to it.
One way a drive could 'wear out' faster is if the operating system was doing a lot of memory caching to disk, also known as 'disk thrashing'.  Another way is if your filesystem was heavily fragmented, and the disk had to traverse large sections of the hard drive platters to fetch data.
I agree that formatting is no more damaging than any other function. Less than my StarCraft II game, by far!
One additional thing a low level format does is add bad sectors to the bad sector list. As others have said this is killing a fly with a hand grenade. If you have enough bad sectors to slow down Windows, get a new drive.
Hahaha! Actually it's absolutely impossible to perform clean install of Windows, without format of the disk or partition! Everytime when you reinstalling the OS, you have to press Format button. And no! It wouldn't harm your hdd, because this is how it works!
Also, so many installs may make you sloppy when it comes to updating the OS or apps, making you more likely to get malware.
