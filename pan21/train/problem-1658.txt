I have a FastCGI script which starts creating a file for request and sends redirection header to the client with location of a new file just after a first pice of that file has been written to the HDD. Everything works fine but when client request a file from a redirection, it receives Content-lenght header with length of the file which has already been written to the file when request has been made and the client doesn't receive part of the file which was created after the request.
If that's what's going on your client is probably requesting File A before it it's done being written to, and it's getting the correct content-length for the contents of the file when it was requested.
I'm not sure if I'm following your question, but it sounds like you have a process that starts writing to File A  sends a 3xx-series redirect message to the client telling it to go get File A, then continues writing to File A.
Do note this breaks RFC behaviour and I'm not sure whether Apache would indeed be able to transfer the whole file after removing the header - for all we know it may still use an internal counter independent of this particular header.
How can I configure Apache to avoid sending Content-lenght header for uncompleted files and keep sending files until it sends whole completed file?
You can put this inside a Directory section if the incomplete files are all in the same directory, or some other block if more appropriate.
