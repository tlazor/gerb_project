It's organized around techniques rather than results, though often the technique was developed for a particular result, and it covers several seminal results and important proof techniques.
What papers would you suggest to a person like me? And please briefly explain why you think the paper is important. 
I agree with Abuzer's answer above: I think that every chapter of a computational complexity book (like Arora and Barack's "Computational Complexity: a Modern Approach" or Goldreich's "Computational Complexity: a Conceptual Perspective" ) contains (and often explains in a more clear way) results that come from important/fundamental papers. And while reading a computational complexity book you can better understand why they are considered important.
Not only is this a recent important result, it is a very well-written paper. Furthermore, the results the paper uses and cites cover a pretty good range of seminal complexity results. So if you trace through the references and read those as well - get to a point where you understand every part of the ACC lower bound from first principles - I would think that would be an excellent start to a graduate complexity education.
