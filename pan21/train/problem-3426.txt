You might also want to have a look at Transit NXT (www.star-transit.com), STAR's integrated computer assisted translation environment. It comes with conversion filters for all the main  formats used today in content creation, features its proprietary high-productivity translation editor. It also has and integrated terminology management component as well as project management and quality assurance functionality.  
Last year I had occasion to look into internationalization and localization software, and some of them had features that looked like automatic translation.  The software I was looking at cost something vaguely like a couple thousand a seat, to give you an idea, but I wasn't looking for anything like machine translation.  (For my project, we'd just translate everything with locally available translators.)
But rather something that aids me in translating large pieces of text, since it has to be a perfect translation i can't leave it to computers alone.
But looking for such software on google etc. is really hard because of the confusion with translation services and things like babelfish.
Something like http://translate.google.com/toolkit but with more options/functions would be great. Preferably freeware ofcourse (But paid is not a problem). At the moment i use the Google toolkit since it's adequate for now, but i really need something more advanced.
I'm looking for a good translation software. i do not mean something that does all the translation automatically for me. 
I've tried a few, and my favorite is currently Kilgray's MemoQ (http://www.memoq.com). They have a free version that has some annoyances, but is ultimately more helpful than unhelpful. (The paid version is quite expensive.)
