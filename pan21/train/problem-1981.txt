Regarding the SERVFAIL errors, do check the BIND logs to see what is actually going on. named-checkconf -zj may also be useful for validating the configuration itself.
For testing, I'm just trying to use the OpenDNS resolvers with DNSCrypt. My goal is to eventually send my traffic to a VPS I use to then forward to my desired DNS servers. It's important that the local BIND servers are able to respond to queries for internal DNS as well. I do have a zone I need to be able to resolve internally.
I then configure BIND with the forwarder of 127.0.1.2 and this is where it stops working. If I now run a dig command against 127.0.0.1 I get a SERVFAIL error, but the dig against 127.0.1.2 still works.
I'm stuck. I'm trying to leverage DNSCrypt in the wake of the recent changes with ISP laws in the USA. Here's my setup:
The idea of censoring (changing) DNS data is fundamentally at odds with validating authenticity of DNS data, so I don't expect this to change.
recursion no is not what you want as forwarding is essentially considered a special case of recursion.
If you must use OpenDNS, make sure you disable DNSSEC validation in BIND as the OpenDNS servvice is incompatible with DNSSEC.
In addition to this, performing a pcap from my router shows plenty of outbound DNS queries over port 53 (instead of the 443 used by dnscrypt) to the various root servers.
