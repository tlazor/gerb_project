I want to monitor tomcat server, according to the doc I have add the remote monitoring Mbean Server connection string in /tomcat/bin/catalina.sh file
I have restarted the tomcat service after that. But not able to see port 6969 listening on the server. After restarting the tomcat i have checked it via "netstat -an | grep 696" I think this is the problem. Port 6969 is not used on this machine. 
localhost on the machine will work ??. I think you should use the IP of the remote machine instead of localhost.
6) List the available Mbeans, copy paste the output and send to me.  We will review what is available and what is needed.
$>bean name_of_object from_output_above (ex.net.lag.kestrel:name=queues.weather_updates,type=Config)
(Note: port 20051 is the port your servers use for JMX.  I looked at the data from one of your servers and saw the following on the javacommand line: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=20051.  If the test server is using a different java command line, you need to locate the same option and the port number if it's different)
Finally I make it work. I added the setting in JAVA_OPTS variable in tomcat startup script as below:
