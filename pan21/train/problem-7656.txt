The primary DNS suffix is is defined on the DNS client machines and it is the name of a domain added to unqualified names when they can't resolve alone like explained by Evan Anderson.
An alias is a "synonym" for the host. It is defined in the DNS server so the host can be reached using its "normal" name (record type A on the DNS server) and using the alias name (record type CNAME on the DNS server). If you change the host's IP, the alias (or all the aliases) will stay correct without doing anything, you only need to change the A record of the host.
Basically, the primary DNS suffix is appended to unqualified names by the resolver during recursive resolution requests.
The "Primary DNS suffix" is used by the computer to resolve unqualified names. If, for example, you issue the command "ping bob" and your primary DNS suffix is set to "dobbs.com", the DNS resolver will search your HOSTS file for an entry for "bob", then an entry for "bob.dobbs.com", and finally will issue a recursive resolution request to your primary DNS server for the name "bob.dobbs.com".
For example you can have a host like example.com with an Alias www.example.com and you'll be able to reach it both ways.
