It's actually (typically C:, but can be whatever) C:\Users\whichever_your_user\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\which_ever_your_profile.default\Cache
\user\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\2uvhpjia.default\Cache and being able to open most the vid files up in vlc.
"whichever your profile" is a random like string (ie: "iufrweriowej") , and for you to "guess" it, I recommend you just go to C:\Users\whichever_your_user\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\  , so there you will see which is the exact profile name.
How do I manually download a streaming video (I use Firefox). I don't wanna use any add-ons or any 3 rd party software or anything else. I just want to save my streaming videos manually. How can I do this ?
There, if you set the folder view as "details", you will see as well the size. A youtube video, even if small, is going to be of several MBs of size, so it's easy to spot. You can just copy and paste one of the latest, biggest files, if you do it inmediately, (and you order by date modified) , place somewhere else, and in the case of youtube and many streaming videos, just rename to have .flv extension. To playback an flv you totally need an external player, VLC is a very good one, and also serves as a general many-formats video player.
