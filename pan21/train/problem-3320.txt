If you have VMWare fusion, Parallels, or some other virtualization technology and a windows image, you could install the free Windows Word 2007 Viewer.
Why not just use a free Word Processor like AbiWord or NeoOffice/Open Office, which can open Word files?
If you just need to view documents, and not do much editing/creation - Google Documents works great, and is free, with no installation or downloads required.
If you have a Hotmail account (or any email account attached to a Windows Live account), you can use the new Office Web Apps.  They are surprsingly good and much better than the Google Docs apps, in my opinion.
Bean uses Apple's file conversion services to open and save Word 2007 format files. Please note that due to the limitations of the file format converter, images are lost when opening a native Word 2007 format file in Bean and when saving a rich text document as a Word 2007 format file in Bean. Also lost are highlighting, tables, text lists and advanced paragraph formatting. Sorry, this is how Apple implemented it. The user will be warned of this when overwriting a Word 2007 format file not created by Bean, to prevent loss of information. Bean should not be considered a replacement for Word, or any other word processor designed for complex documents involving, for example, citations.
