I changed my server SSH port to something else than port 22, however when I access to domain.com:<ssh-port> I can see an output of 
By design, any application can connect to any IP port.  Once the connection is established things then go up to the application level to communicate with each other.  Direct port access is at a lower level than SSH.  Port access is at the IP level, SSH is at the application level.  Port connections are established before SSH is even a part of the picture.  Once the port connection is established then SSH is able to start doing its thing.
You need an application level protocol analyzer to intercept connections on the port in order to do what you're thinking.  That analyzer needs to be able to read connections on the port, look at the application level protocol involved, then block the connection based on what application level protocol is in use.  I'm not an iptables expert, but I don't think that it can do this level of filtering.  You probably need a more advanced firewall product to do this.  (Someone can correct me if I'm wrong on that).
If this is the case, there is nothing you can do with iptables to "block" web-browsers and only accept ssh clients.  You either leave the port open... or you don't.
If I understand your question correctly... you've configured your ssh server to listen on port 80.  HTTP traffic is typically done over port 80.  When using a web-browser to connect to that box... you see the initial data sent by the ssh server.
