SSH for file sharing is not really practical. Using SSH is more like file transfer, in that you need to transfer each individual file (like an FTP session). There are ways around that (SSHFS), but it's probably easier just to use Samba.
My user name and UID, group name and GID are all the same on both Linux boxes, any boot/desktop. (I have two sets, for testing purposes.)
You could go for NFS, but on Windows it's a bit tricky to set up (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732891.aspx). If you would use the file shares frequently or need them for production, you could look into that. 
If you are going to mix Windows and Linux and use it occasionally it'd probably be best to go with Samba. You don't need to install additional software on either system. Just make sure all systems have shares configured and you should be able to access them from all systems.
This is a home network and I am the only person using it. I have two Linux boxes (Mint 16 and 17) dual boot with both MATE and Cinnamon desktop logins. I would like to set up my network to enable complete access to anything and everything on either machine from either machine (or as close to that as I can get).
