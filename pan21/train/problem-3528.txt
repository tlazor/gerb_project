Note that the disk space occupied by the WSL may vary depending on the Linux distributions you install in your computer. Currently, it is possible to install multiple distributions: e.g., Ubuntu 14, Ubuntu 18, Opensuse and Kali Linux. In fact, you can create your own distributions.
I have no problem with the other answers, "linux distro app not running, no resources being used", however if you run a persistent process within the WSL linux distro app the process will continue even when the linux app is closed. eg I have WSL ubuntu 18.04 running on W10 x64 pro 1903.
