You can take advantage of the fact that full user sessions launch the userinit.exe process while RemoteApp sessions launch the rdpshell.exe process. AppLocker can be used to prohibit userinit.exe from being executed by standard users.
There isn't an "officially sanctioned" way to do this because, fundamentally, TS RemoteApp functionality is just leveraging existing Remote Desktop code. You could do something silly like use Group Policy to set the user's shell to be "logoff.exe" such that if they attempted to access the machine's desktop they'd be immediately logged-off. Any application that uses a common "File / Open" dialog, though, can be used to get a command prompt or other programs open on the server's desktop.

You're better off making sure that you follow the principle of least privilege and give your TS RemoteApp users as few rights as they need to run the intended software. If they do end up on the server computer's desktop their restricted rights should prevent them from doing anything damaging to the server computer. 
It is better to use "Application control policy" in the security settings just to allow only necessary applications or scripts if you use Windows 7 or Windows 2008 R2
