I know you can change this by running a stored proc, but is there any way to do it that would work while the machine is offline?  If not, is there a way I can push a sql command onto a queue somewhere so that it gets run the next time SQL starts up?
What you can do is use the stored procedure sp_procoption to run a specified sp at startup. In this procedure you'll have to read your values from the registry, file or other linked server.
A fun way to do this across many machines using the power of SQL 2008 is by using the new policy based management. Create a policy that sets the max memory to a number of your choosing. Apply your policy against the target server and your setting will change. If you don't have a SQL 2008 instance in-house yet you can download the 180-day trial of Enterprise Edition and try it out. 
You can run a stored procedure on startup - see http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/08/14/60280.aspx.  Your stored procedure could then read in parameters from the file system.  Bit nasty though.
I'm building VMs centrally and distributing subtly tweaked versions to different people.  I've been doing this by mounting the virtual hard disk and editing files.  I'm pretty confident I can do something similar with the registry.  The next subtle tweak I'd like to make is to the SQL memory allocations.
