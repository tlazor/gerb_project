At my last gig we used vsftpd on ~2 frontend "ftp" servers that accessed a SAN, which in turn powered ~40 frontend webservers.  A couple thousand clients.
I was using winOpenSSH but it crashed one time, and even after 3-4 reinstalls it never started working again. And I didn't have the patience to really figure out was going wrong, seemed like the ssh worked, but then the sftp server service was down after authentication.
There is no way to really have plain "FTP" be secure as the username/password are sent in cleartext.
You might want to investigate using a form of WebDAV for easy file transfers to clients; if this is something in a business on the internal LAN, why isn't a file share possible?
This may not be considered "ftp" but I use WWW FileShare Pro where I work.  It allows us to set up accounts for clients that can't install FTP software.  All that's needed on the client end is an internet browser.  There are only 20 people working here but we have many clients.  I've set up a spare computer as the "server" and mapped the client account folder as a network drive so anyone can put put files into their client's folders for download.
otherwise, vsftpd has worked fairly well in the past, but again we're not slapping much for sharing up there because it is insecure as a protocol and we normally resort to shares via SAMBA/native Windows to get files moved around.
