Windows XP's regional settings says that I am using UK English. Normal.dot is using UK English. The exchange server's regional settings says UK English. 
When I send an email through Outlook 2003 (using Word 2003 to compose my mail) I get the subject checked in US English and the Body spell checked in UK English.
The problem you have here is most likely that you are using word as your email editor, so Outlook uses the dictionary set in word for the body of the email, which will be UK English, however the spell checking in the subject line is done by Outlook itself, which is probably set to US English.
To change Outlooks language (in Outlook 2007), go to Tools, Options, Spelling Tab, Spelling and AutoCorrection - In this new menu you will see in the middle section "Custom Dictionaries." Click this button and then use the drop down menu at the bottom of the next screen to set Dictionary Language to English UK.
In Outlook 2003, you need to take a look in c:\program files\microsoft office\office11\1033. In here should be a file called email.dot, right click on the file and go to 'open the file', do not double click. In here in the status bar at the bottom it should show "English (US)", double click on this and change to English (UK). Save and close, it should now have the right dictionary.
If you go into 'Control Panel', head into 'Region and Language' and then select the 'Administrative' tab - I highly suspect your 'Language for Non-unicode programs' system locale setting will be configured as "English (United States)". Fix it and reboot.
