So I was thinking in doing some extra codding to protect me against the loss of the witness in some cases.
I have 3 databases, (One principal, one Mirror and a witness) and I'm trying to make this system the most fault tolerant as possible.
I have a state_db database with 2 columns (last_state and current_state), and I need to be able to check the current state, with the one in my state_db. if they are different I want to modify the last_state with current_state and current_state with the fresh state read from SYS.database_mirroring
I want to keep track of mirroring_state_desc in SYS.database_mirroring database, so that in case it changes from SYNCHRONISING to DISCONNECTED I'll know its not safe to promote it to principal, but if it changes from SYNCHRONIZED to DISCONNECTED is ok to promote it (I'm working in high safety mode)
My first approach was to have a custom windows service monitoring this table...but doing that I'm doing a LOT of unnecessary selects to the database.
My question is, can I use a trigger for insert and modify to keep an auxiliary database with the last 2 states of SYS.database_mirroring?? and if yes, how can I do it?
