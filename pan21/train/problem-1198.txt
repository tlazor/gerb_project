Does Windows (XP or later) have a built-in way to create persitent drive mappings, like the ones SUBST creates? I found a 3rd party tool psubst. Is there a way to do it without 3rd party tools?
First, I edited the registry, but was unable to get it to work.  However, I did come across this alternative, which although it doesn't use subst does answer for me the question, "How to make SUBST mapping persistent across reboots?" Don't use subst... (insert appropriate 'computerName' and 'pathName'):
Note that there are two lots of character escaping in the second example. Backslashes for the inner double-quotes that surround the path argument, and carets for the environment variable's percentage signs. Double-quotes aren't always required, but to avoid problems with folder names containing spaces it's recommended to use them.
Here are two examples using reg.exe to add the required entry to the Run Registry subkey of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive. These examples can be adapted as required. Open an unelevated cmd window as the current user, and paste in the adapted line.
I found this because I was looking for an improvement over my startup subst scripts - they worked OK, but sometimes executed after folders crashed on startup because my drive wasn't yet mapped.
I adapted this from Hank Arnold's suggestion at this discussion of mapping local drives.  I had guessed that \\myComputerName\c might work, but I didn't know to apply the $.
