A: If your .vmdk is thin-provisioned, you're able to enlarge the .vmdk file, even while the VM is running (with vSphere 4, that is).
How is your filesystem currently laid-out on the VMDK files? Is your largest partition (/storage) the last partition on the drive? Or is it on a separate VMDK file? The right process in either of those cases would be to shut down the virtual machine. Edit the machine's configuration from your VMWare client and expand the VMDK file to the desired total size. Boot your system and use the appropriate resizing tool for your filesystem, (e.g. xfs_growfs for XFS, resize2fs for ext2/ext3).
In this case, you'll have to add another disk (i.e. .vmdk file) to the VM in order to gain more disk space.
Then at some point you can increase the size of Disk2 to 200gb in the VM properties, add the extra 100gb to your LVM Volume Group, and then you can increase the size of the Logical Volume /storage
While having two different .vmdk's on different disks acting as two LVM extents isn't perhaps the perfect way of doing this I wouldn't worry about it one bit. Certainly it'll work just fine, I don't believe fragmentation will be significantly more than if it were one disk.
