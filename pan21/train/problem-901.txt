My interpretation is that the author is saying that for a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}\to \{0,1\}$, "a quantum evolution" which implements this function is a unitary operator $U_f$ such that $U_f| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle = | x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$. (I assume he is only considering unitaries rather than CPTP maps, as this makes more sense in the context of Deutsch's algorithm). Here the second qubit is the output qubit. The reason two qubits are required is that not all boolean functions are reversible, and the ancilla is required in order to satisfy unitarity by making the evolution reversible. I believe this is the situation the author was trying to get across, as this is indeed how the oracle functions in the Deutsch algorithm.
Thus, the unitary has not fully been prescribed, but is of the general form $U_f = \sum_{x,y = 0}^1 \phi_{xy} |x\rangle\langle x| \otimes |y \otimes f(x) \rangle\langle y|$ where $\phi_{xy}$ are roots of unitary. This is the most general description of a unitary which implements the required functionality.
As Shaun mentioned, the algorithm would also work with an oracle which flipped the outputs, but that would no longer be the oracle for the same boolean function, and the whole point of the algorithm is to show that classical and quantum strategies require different numbers of calls to the same oracle.
