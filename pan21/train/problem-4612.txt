I even tried a third-party program called LockHunter, which indicated that the files weren't in use by any applications; however it was unable to delete them. It said I could attempt to delete the files upon reboot, but that, too, failed.
I tried to delete those and it said I couldn't because they were owned by TrustedInstaller. So, naturally, I changed ownership on those files to Administrators, and then gave Administrators full access. But then when I tried deleting them, it said they were in use by the system and so couldn't be deleted.
I've got a Windows 10 tablet that was upgraded from Windows 8. As a result of the upgrade, it kept some files in the C:\Windows.old folder. I ran the Disk Cleanup utility (diskmgr) to try and delete those, by checking the box to delete "Previous Windows Installation(s)." This did delete most of the contents of that folder; however, six system files were left in there, actually two copies of these three files:
I was able to move them out of the C:\Windows.old folder, and into my Documents folder, thereby allowing me to delete the Windows.old folder. However, I still can't delete those six files which are now in my Documents folders. I am even able to rename them. I tried changing their file extension from "sys" to "pancakes." That works fine, but I am still unable to delete.
