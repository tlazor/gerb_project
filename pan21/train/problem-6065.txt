A 64-bit operating system uses instructions provided by a 64-bit CPU. If your CPU doesn't support them then you won't be able to run, much less install.
You must reinstall the machine to do 64 bit (which I think a move from XP to 7 requires anyways). Your processor must support 64 bit. All newer Intel and AMD chips do. If it's 3-4 years old and an AMD system, it almost certainly supports 64 bit. Intel was a little slower adding 64 bit support and may or may not support it. The only major advantage to 64 bit is the ability to use over 3.5GB of ram on a windows client operating system. Your 3-4 year old motherboard probably cannot support that much memory though. There's some extra registers in there as well, but for most applications, you won't notice any difference.
Running a 64-bit OS isn't really something to consider unless your computer has more than 2gb of ram.  If you do have more than 2gb then the next thing is to check and see if your CPU can handle the 64-bit OS...  Start here...
I would recommend sticking with 32 bit as there are still certain things that don't work with 64 bit (although that list is shortening every day) and your computer probably won't get any benefit performance wise.
