Eliminates "Play" button on Mac keyboard from launching iTunes but, more importantly for me, stopped headphones (direct in + bluetooth) from accidentally launching iTunes.
It's driving me crazy! I can't find any option in preferences; I don't think I'm dealing with any media files, and the damn program just opens and opens and opens again no matter how many times I quit--not always immediately, but after 5-60 minutes it just pops itself open again. WHY?! (And obviously more importantly, how do I make it stop?!?) Thanks!
Go to System Preferences > Accounts > LoginItems and check if there is anything related to iTunes like for example iTunes Helper. If yes untick/delete that item and test again.
Could you be pressing (accidentlally or otherwise) the play or skip keys that are on F7-F9 on more recent Apple keyboards? I find that causes iTunes to pop up. To use them as a proper function key, hold down the Fn key that's in the bottom left for labtop and wireless keyboards and above the left arrow on extended keyboards (this can be reversed in the Keyboard section of System Preferences). I'd love to know if there's a way to prevent iTunes popping up while still using the key as play/pause - I'm always doing it to myself.
