So my question is: why is this the M.O. for telephony systems?  Why not leave in-call DTMF alone unless translation is explicitly required?
I am using Asterisk to interact with analog telephony devices that can be programmed and tested with DTMF interaction.
The problem arises when Asterisk (or another telephony system) decides it needs to recognize and regenerate the DTMF.  I realize that this is important to do when translating e.g. to/from out-of-band DTMF, but I'm not sure why it seems to be the default action to do this, and in particular why it is often regenerated with lengthy durations (e.g. 100ms; thankfully, in Asterisk, this can be changed, although it can involve a recompile) that is almost guaranteed to mean loss of digits.  Others have reported issues where in-band conversion to out-of-band has resulted in duplicated digits, even though the conversion was not necessary.
Some of these guys speak rather quickly.  Too quickly, you could convincingly argue; I'd be right with you there.  And yet, Asterisk is perfectly capable of hearing the tones, and if I'm lucky enough to get a pure stream with in-band DTMF audio, I can recognize even really fast tones very succesfully.
