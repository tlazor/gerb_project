I am fairly new to unreal engine and I would like to know how to set custom gravity in a specific point or area instead of down. For example I do not want the gravity pull to be down but more to the center of my level (center plane not center point) and that gravity to only affect specific actors. Other actors will be affected by normal gravity or affected by no gravity at all. 
You can not change the direction of the built-in gravity, it always points to the negative z-axis. You can also not change the gravity for single actors, only globally. But why do you need that, you can always just increase the mass of your actor.
You can easily turn off gravity completely for any actor, just look for "gravity" in the blueprint options of that actor.
I know they're planning to un-hardcode Gravity [Source: I'm a moderator on the official Unreal Engine forums, I know things ;)] but the best way is to either add force in the direction you want or set the player to "Flying" mode and push him about with Launch character / Add force.
