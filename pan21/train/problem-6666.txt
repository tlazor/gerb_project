But the problem gets even more random. When I run a tcpdump on the server, it doesn’t happen, or if other computers are connected, but when I closes tcpdump, or the other connections, it throws the connection between physical and virtual computer, after some time.
My problem is when I connect to the server from windows, using Putty, it throws the connection after a random period of time. 
I work on a problem that has been bugging me for some days now, and I don't know where to go next. I got a Windows 7 computer with VMware workstation on, and in VMware I have an Ubuntu 10.04 server running.
It only happens when I connect from the windows, not if I connect from another computer. (I tried both with Linux console SSH, and putty from other windows’, and computers with same network driver as my)
Checkout PuTTY's "Enable TCP keepalives" option (see "Connection" during PuTTY configuration). That did the trick for me once.
Lastly it’s a converted vmdk, I am running on the VMware workstation, but I’ve tried it on other computers without problems.
