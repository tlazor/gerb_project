I'm basically getting the difference between the centre of the player and the centre of the colliding platform to determine which side the player is colliding with. When my player jumps and walks right on the platform he goes right through. The same can also be observed when I jump on the actual platform, should I be resetting the players y in this situation?
So I'm having some problems with my collision detection with my platformer. Take the image below as an example.
Note that snap only the y-axis for the floors. If you know the difference between the floor and horizontal objects.
Before reacting to the collisions, first position your player so that he will not be stuck again. This can be achieved as follows.
After going through the problem, it was clear that the standard intersect method provided by slick wouldn't do. Instead, I wrote a SAT collision detection method to detect collisions. But more importantly, the algorithm returned a correction vector to correctly place the player outside the colliding shape. This seems more natural than to adjust the players x/y buy some value.
When I'm running right I am unable to go through the platform, but when I hold my right key and jump, I end up going through the object as shown in the image, below is the code im using:
I wrote a lil engine called TwoTryEngine with Slick.The only thing i want to say about the engine is that my engine is checking the new positions before the player is moving to the new positions.This also solves a problem with moving on top problems, but my engine still has to get much more fixes.So i dont gonna upload it if you are interessted.like other guy before said use dx and this stuff.
