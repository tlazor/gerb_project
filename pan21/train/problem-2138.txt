However, when the same mail gets through my server, my server tries to forward it to alice, and her server rejects it during the SMTP phase, my server creates a bounce message to the innocent backscatter victim. (Which makes sense from the point of view of my server, but it's annoying for the backscatter victim.)
Ideally you would do this for only NDRs to non-local users but I don't think that's possible with header_checks alone.
If it isn't flagged as spam, but alice rejects the mail, I can't see a way for your Postfix server to not bounce the mail back to the victim, without turning off NDR's :(
I run a Postfix server that hosts a small, alias-based mailing list. Let's say people@myserver forwards to alice@someprovider and bob@someotherprovider. Now, alice@someprovider might use a more restrictive spam filter than I do.
Instead of discarding bounces completely, it is possible to intercept all outgoing NDRs and redirect them to a single mailbox instead of discarding them.
This means all bounces will go to a single mailbox which may be a good enough compromise between discarding and sending NDRs out for small sites with few users.
Is there a way to prevent this behavior? I don't want to turn off NDRs, since (in general) they serve a legitimate purpose.
When a spam mail from (forged) backscattervictim@somewhere to people@myserver arrives, and my spam filter detects it as spam, it is rejected in the SMTP phase --> no harm done.
