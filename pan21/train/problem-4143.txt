The fix for that is this: I went back to my 4th virtual desktop, launched a command line window, cd'd to the firefox directory (C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox)(don't really need to do that when the path to FF is in the system path environment variable), and launched it from there with a command line command (firefox -P second_user). This time the FF window opened on my 4th virtual window. Done. Mischief managed.
Simple solution is to open task manager and kill(end) the firefox process. Next time you fire up firefox you will find recovery tab and you can start from there.
The answer by hvtuananh still works today on Win 7 for me (using MS:Desktops). I added a second profile in ProfileManager (called second_user) and also unchecked the box to always use the selected profile at startup.  Then on FF Properties I added the arg "-no-remote". I can get multiple instances of FF now. There's still a problem though - they all open on my first virtual desktop even though I was on my 4th virtual desktop when I clicked my QuickLaunch bar icon for FF. (Yes, I added it back.)
I haven't tried this, but maybe you could could copy and rename your main profile (as many times as you want), then run extra instances of Firefox using these new-but-identical profiles. (Just remember to save any new bookmarks in your original profile or thing could get confusing.)
