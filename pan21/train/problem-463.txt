The reason more memory usually gives better performance is swapping--if you run out of available RAM, your operating system will start using your hard drive for memory, which is incredibly slow compared to RAM. Having more memory will decrease your chances of ever running out. However, unless you're doing some serious memory-hungry work, 8GB is way too much for an Ubuntu machine. 2GB should be fine for day-to-day use, but you can upgrade to 4GB if you really feel like you need more. What do you use the computer for?
Memory is just space for applications to store data while they are running. Reading and writing off the hard drive is very slow, so programs use memory for data that they will need to access often. The more memory you have, the more applications you can have open at one time before they start defaulting to the hard drive. In other words, the more memory you have, the faster your applications will run when you have more open at once. In most cases you cannot share memory with your video card - it usually only applies to on-board video.
i have 2gb on a relatively old macbook running arch linux and it is perfectly fine for playing videos, compiling kernels, etc.
you can run a utility like top or free to see how much memory you are really using, so you don't just have to guess about it.
