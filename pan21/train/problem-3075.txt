According to http://mono-project.com/DistroPackages/Debian this is the latest version of mono I can have so it looks like I need to use the 'Testing' version on Wheezy to get version 2.10.8.1. So my question is, how do I upgrade to a testing version and is this not advised? My server currently has a few sites running on it and is not a test server by any means.
See: http://backports-master.debian.org/ for how to configure apt to use this, but it's a bit of a lottery as to whether the maintainers are building a backport version for any given package. 
I'm assuming I will need to add some new or modify the current repositories in my /etc/apt/sources.list but will this affect other stuff installed on my server?
Adding deb-src (ONLY deb-src!) lines for wheezy and using "apt-get -b source" sometimes works to recompile packages into an older distribution. You will probably have to install dependencies the same way.
One thing you can try is squeeze-backports. This is a smaller repository of newer versions of popular packages than those that come with squeeze. Since they've been compiled against the libraries that ship with squeeze, you don't get the dependency problems. 
Another thing worth trying is to apt-get source of package you need and compile it against squeeze version of libraries.
You might just get away with this if for instance the package you're installing has no library dependencies and is pretty much atomic (such as a small web app), but basically you'll end up in dependency hell with anything more complicated.
Longer version: If you set your Debian release forward to install a package, dpkg will try to install all the dependencies for that package from that new release, too. These will then have further dependenices that it will also try to install, half of which will clash with the dependencies required by your existing packages.
