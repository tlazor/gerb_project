When I try to access http://my.domain.com/blog, my browser gets redirected to the HTTPS version of the page, but nothing is displayed even though the HTTP status code is 200 OK. The rest of the site is working fine with SSL/HTTPS, as far static files in /path/to/project/public/css/something.css, for instance.
I have a domain my.domain.com that points to a Zend Framework 2 application at /path/to/project/public which has a .htaccess and index.php file which handles all requests. At /path/to/project/public/blog, I want to have a standalone site which is basically just an index.php file that should be independent from the rest of the site. This all worked fine until I enabled HTTPS on the server. Below is my configuration.
I tried various things such as adding a virtual host alias, but nothing worked so far. So, to sum up: I want http://my.domain.com/blog to redirect to https://my.domain.com/blog and execute /path/to/project/public/blog/index.php (or any other files within that subdirectory), independent of the rest of my site. At the same time, I want http://my.domain.com/whatever to redirect to https://my.domain.com/whatever and execute /path/to/project/public/index.php.
Does anyone know how to do this? I am not so good at Apache configs/htaccess, so the simpler the better. Thanks in advance!
