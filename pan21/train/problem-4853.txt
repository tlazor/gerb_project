There is a very good thread regarding DD-WRT & the WRT320N, if you go this route be sure to read it.
The latest US firmware is supposedly quite good, but EU firmware is behind and there is a bug in the old (and current EU) versions that forces you to disable upnp, or your throughput will tank in a day or two.
I decided to go with the linksys wrt320n. It isn't supported by dd-wrt yet, but I think support will be here soon.
I've had very good luck with a pair of WRT320N routers running DD-WRT.  Got them refurbished & I've been punishing both of them ever since I brought them home & loaded them with DD-WRT.
Also, I've noticed significant speed increases due to the 802.11n and the gigabit switch.  Sorry, I haven't done any quantitative measurements.
The reason I picked it is because it got a gigabit ethernet switch and around 100Mbit wan-lan throughput. Also the fact that I expect dd-wrt to work on it real soon now is important :)
Although I do think N is a waste of time the WRT54GL suffers from mediocre throughput (max 30 Mbit wan-lan). If you got a 100Mbit Internet connection you need newer gear.
Finally, here's a chart just to show you what the stock firmware/hardware is capable of: http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/component/option,com_chart/Itemid,189/.  If throughput is important, remember that DD-WRT does not increase speed, just adds a lot more functionality.
