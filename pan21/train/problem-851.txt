If your traffic uses TCP for communication, any Layer 2 traffic duplication won't work. This is because TCP handshake is a bi-directional process, where client needs to send back response packets to the client.
You should be able to set traffic processing rules in HAProxy, which divides traffic between servers. This way you can get real traffic to the test server.
The only thing similar to what you are asking is port mirroring on a switch. This would split the traffic, but you cannot have both servers responding to the same packets. Port mirroring is usually used with a listen-only device for reporting or tracking. It would not be able to give you a load test.
If such traffic duplication is done on a higher level, the issue is responses to clients. If two server's receive the same traffic, and both send responses back, which response should be sent?
The only good solution is to set up proper load-testing using tools designed for it. With the tools, you can set up test scenarios for load testing, and the perform requests like real clients.
