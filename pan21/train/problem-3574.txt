Instead, when using ORDER BY, the values in a row are kept together, resulting in the correct data set where ABC stores is still buying 30 bottles of fruit punch, Nick Cage gets his beekeeper suit, and ZZ Top continue to have clean facial hair.
You are thinking of a columnar database/table (a columnar database stores data in columns instead of rows). Vast majority of RDBMs out there and their default setting stores data as rows (row-oriented database). In your case, the RDBMS first sorts the rows based on the descending values of the first column, as prescribed in your SQL statement. Then, it sorts it based on the second one (Val2). However, in your case, this is useless since you only have two columns. Consider, however, a table with 300 columns, in such a case you want a first order and second order sort. In Excel language what you are doing is called first order, second order, etc. 
Suddenly your records now indicate that ABC stores bought 30 bottles of Beard Wash, Nicolas Cage was kind of thirsty one day, and ZZ Top is sharing a single bee suit between them.
You can't really order by two columns simultaneously with ORDER BY alone, but to get to your desirable output you could do something within Common Table Expressions:
