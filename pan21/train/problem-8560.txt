Ok, this may look like it might be an Apache or an Owncloud question, but I think the way I want to try and solve the problem is a more generic one:
But I don't know how to do that, or if it's even possible. chmod confuses me with the different notations, and also there's the thing of modifying permissions for just the one user.
On a Mythbuntu 14.04 server box, I have Apache 2.4.7 running Owncloud. I want another application on the same system (the Amarok music player) having access to the music files managed by the Owncloud server. However, only the Apache user "www-data" has permission to read anything under /var/www/owncloud/data (they're supposed to be handled only through the Oc web interface or a sync client app).
Add the user to the group www-data, this should allow the user to access the files that you need.  See comments on the question if you need more information about it.  sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username> from a terminal window will add the user to the group for you.
I think it wouldn't be a security problem to grant my user "ben" on that box read-only access to just the directory that contains all the music: /var/www/owncloud/data//files/Music
