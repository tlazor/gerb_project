Performance-wise you won't notice any difference, sure using 10 extra vertices costs some memory, but considering modern games have millions of vertices, this shouldn't be noticeable. CPU-wise you don't really get any penalty, you draw the same amount of triangles (assuming the two separate objects connect perfectly), so the same amount of pixels on the screen are being drawn. You may get an overhead if you execute more drawing calls, but that really depends on the game engine / graphics library.
For the UV part, I'm not sure if I understand it correctly, but when you have UVs greater than 1 there isn't any important penalty in performance, and the behaviour depends on the engine / library that you use. For instance, OpenGL has the GL_REPEAT flag, so if you have UVs greater than 1, the texture simply repeats itself like tiles. So U = 2; and V = 2; would mean that the texture would be drawn 2 times horizontally and 2 times vertically.
The real question is, why would you want to create separate simple objects? If there is no reason, creating one complex one sounds like the best solution, so you have one object to worry about, which makes it more maintainable.
If for any reason you want to have separate objects (to animate them manually, or for any other reason) then you should have them separate, but they'd be harder to maintain, as now you have more objects in your scene.
