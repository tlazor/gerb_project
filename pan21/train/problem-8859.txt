So I wanted to know if we buy a twin wan router, will it solve our need to provide access to our clients to some services as well as continue using the high speed connection for our daily use?
I have a high speed Internet connection with dynamic IP that we use in our office. We have some services like, svn, that we want our clients to access. So we checked with our ISP to provide static IP on our current high speed plan. But this is costing way too much. So we have thought to buy another low speed connection with a static IP. 
Sometimes we our clients have firewalled server and to access (FTP etc) them we have to provide our IP. But since it is dynamic client has to update it everytime it is changed. So to solve that also we need a static IP.
If the new connection with static IP will be needed just for incoming connections, you can easily just put another router configured accordingly and get away with it. Your office will continue to use current high speed connection, and your clients
