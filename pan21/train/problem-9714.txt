I'd like to have the devices that only need to connect to the server, stay on the private network and not be visible to the Public Internet.
Is this the correct architecture and do I set my Router as the Gateway at my Server PC or only program in the DNS settings? Can I keep my Server on the private network 192.168.10.x and Gateway at 192.168.100.x? How will the server be able to reach the router on a different subnet? (I have only one NIC in the server)
The server still needs to talk to the devices on the private network and have Internet access through a router to process credit card transactions.
Without knowing what kind of hardware you have for your router, the easiest thing to do is put everything on the same subnet (server and PCs).  You didn't say that anything on your private network needed to be accessible from the internet so even the most basic router would be set up to hand DHCP addresses (including setting the gateway IP to the router) to the private network and deny all inbound access to the private network from the internet.  Since the PCs and server are on the same subnet, they will have access to each other without needing to route between networks.
Another way would be to give the server two IP addresses (192.168.1.x and 192.168.2.x), put the PCs on 192.168.2.x and the router on 192.168.1.x, and make sure the 2.x machines don't have a route to 1.x.  That's kind of horrible, but it will work.
The easiest way to do this is to add another NIC to the server.  One side can point at the router, one can point at the PCs.
Plug everything into the switch.  Give the server an fixed addess which has apporpriate access to the Internet and an address on the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet.  Set the default route on server to the Firewall.  Block access the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet access to and from the Internet on the firewall.
