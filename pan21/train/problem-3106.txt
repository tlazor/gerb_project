Another option is to parse the %windir%\windowsupdate.log and look for stuff like this: # WARNING: Install call completed, reboot required = Yes, error = 0x00000000
We have setup our important production servers to only install manually, but occastionally some servers are not rebooted manually for a while (humans forget!)

Is there a way to find out if a Windows Server (2003, 2008) has downloaded the Microsoft Windows updates and is just waiting for the user to confirm "Install Updates and Restart the server"?
We use WSUS and SSCM to collect and publish the updates, and the majority of the servers are on automatic install on a Sunday morning, mostly development and test server.
It would be nice if there was some method (powershell script, WMI query, some magic command) that I could use to count or discover if there where updates pending.
you can use wuinstall. It has a /search switch to see if there are updates pending. You can execute remotely with psexec.
