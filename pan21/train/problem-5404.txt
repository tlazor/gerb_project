I post to the discussion boards in our Canvas class, but students very rarely respond and even more rarely start their own discussions. 
And of the 120 or so students I have this year, there are only about 10 that have contacted me outside of school hours. None of these are very intrusive, and they're all pretty easy to ignore if I'm doing something else. 
Slack Trying it out this year. Originally was thinking it would be a good way for the class to talk, sort of like the Facebook Groups in one of the other answers. Didn't really work so well for that. Only a few students are actively using it. But a few do and it works really well. I've got the Slack app on my phone so I'll get buzzed if someone messages me. 
I try to give them as many options as possible, without it becoming too much of pain for me to handle. 
Email Very few students email me, although it's common for parents to email. I've probably only had one or two students email me this year.
Canvas We're using Canvas on our campus and it's easy for students to message me through that. This is where most students contact me outside of class. Like Slack, I've got the Canvas app on my phone.
I do make a point at the beginning of the year that if they need me to help the only times I'm always available is during class and after school tutorials. I may respond outside of that, but it's not guaranteed.
