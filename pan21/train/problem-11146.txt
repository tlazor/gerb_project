A consultant who's done this before (disclaimer I'm a consultant) can be helpful and make the project less stressful, but it isn't required if you are familiar with SQL Server and doing backups and restores.  Everything here is pretty straight forward.  Done correctly the total downtime for SQL Server can be as small as a few minutes or a couple of hours depending on how much data needs to be restored in that last set of log backups.
If you have full access to the SQL Server at the current facility (which it sounds like you do) then Log Shipping will be the way to go.  I've done this many times moving people into/out of/between managed hosting facilities.
Once all this is setup and running, when it comes to the night of the migration you simply shut down the front end site, run the backup logs job, run the copy jobs in order, then run the restore job.  Once everything is done you can bring the databases online at the new site.  Then just point the web servers at Rackspace to the new database server and you are done.
You should use database mirroring to replicate the database to the new server, then fail it over (alter database mydb set partner failover) and break the mirror (alter database mydb set partner off) when you are ready to make your DNS change since mirroring FROM 2008 TO 2005 will not work.  The fail over for database takes around 5-30 seconds and the roll back plan would be to recover the database on the 2005 server (restore database mydb with recovery) and then re-point DNS back to the original server.
