It's not much of an explanation, but I figured it worth pointing out that despite the keyboard being fine under NOOBS, it can apparently be worthwhile trying with a different keyboard.
You may want to check http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals to see if your keyboard is compatible with the Pi
I ended up trying with another keyboard, despite the Mac one working fine in NOOBS, and it worked immediately as advertised.
So on the positive side obviously your keypad can work, but for some reason on raspbian it doesn't.  That's a little bizarre because USB keyboards are standardized -- unless you have a very unusual keypad (you don't actually say what it is).  NOOBS does not look very user friendly to me WRT to accessing the system log, but in raspbian it's /var/log/syslog -- you could have a look at what appears in there when you plug and unplug the keypad.
Presumably NOOBS runs a linux kernel just like all of the options it appears to present, so this is a little strange and understandably frustrating.  Note that although even some of the people responsible have taken to referring to various linux distributions as if they were separate OS's, this is a misnomer: they are all packaged variations on the same operating system (linux).  With regard to hardware compatibility, what works on one linux distribution should (or could be made to) work on another, and what can't work on one can't work on another either.
