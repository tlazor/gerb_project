If you are using Outlook Web Access then I highly recommend this approach, as Dieda suggested. I recently managed a mixed OS environment and was faced with the same problem.
I haven't been able to dedicate much time to the project recently but I started a free tool years ago that does what you need, and more.  Its stable but can be tricky to setup, just like anything AD related.
As you said, there are different approaches to change the active directory password. One possibility is to use the password change option in Outlook webaccess. Another option is to use a ldaps-connection and a programming language of your choice (php,perl,python,java) to change the unicodePW-attribute of the users. A PHP library which handles these things for you is for example adldap (http://adldap.sourceforge.net).
Also, we were planning to support ADFS in the next release so your users could have built-in SSO capabilities with other applications.
I was working on a newer MVC version but other projects have tied me up.  I'll see if I can get back into the swing of things here shortly.
I’ve been Googling, and have found so many options, that I’m not sure how to sort them all out.  Has anyone had positive (or negative) experiences with any particular products?
I’m looking for an affordable solution to offer a “self-service” password reset portal on the web for my active directory users. (about 150 of them)
