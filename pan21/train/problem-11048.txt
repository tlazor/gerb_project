You could also Google down a few smarthost providers and subscribe to their service to send out email.
If you're particularly cheap then I've seen people create a Gmail account and use the Google smtp servers from their web apps.  I wouldn't like to comment on how sensible that is, but it seems to work for them.
SendGrid Basic compares pricewise to a fairly cheap VPS host, but will be a lot more stable and has more features you don't need to maintain yourself.  If you're sending out a lot more emails than that, the features of Silver and above will be worth your while.
You may want to look into a VPS solution for your mail server needs. There are many available, most are likely inexpensive. I've used VPSLink (http://vpslink.com) for a few years for both private and commercial products, and have had mostly good experiences. At this time, their lowest offering will get you a barebones VPS for about eight US dollars per month.
You could go to all this trouble setting up and maintaining your own Postfix server, and that might be the way to go if you want mail services other than just sending out on behalf of your web servers.  However, it'll be cheaper and easier to just have somebody else do it.
Any virtual dedicated server would do this fine.  You just go to a company like slicehost, order a basic one, choose your preferred OS for it, and it'll be ready in no time.  Log in, setup your mailserver, configure firewall etc., and you're done.
