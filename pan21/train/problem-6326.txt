You get one password policy in a domain in Active Directory with Windows Server 2003. You'll have to make a child domain for the users who need a different password policy, or upgrade to Windows Server 2008.
The best way to solve this problem  in windows 2003 is to create a seperate domain.  In Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, you can only have one password policy, account lockout policy and Kerberos authentication per domain. If you have a subset of users within your domain who absolutely require a different configuration for these items, they need to be configured with a separate domain. To configure a password policy for your domain, create a GPO and link it to your domain, or else modify an existing domain policy that's already in place.  The other option is to upgrade to server 2008 AD DS which allows for Fine-Grained Password Policies.
Group policies are applied in the Site -> Domain -> Organizational Unit order. At whatever level you assign your default password policy make sure the "No Override" option is not checked. Then create an new Organization Unit to hold the user accounts you want the different password policy for and create a new group policy on that OU with your specific settings. Other policy settings will be inherited.
I'm pretty sure that this setting is domain-wide, which means that you would need to establish another tree in your active directory forest. Probably not worth it unless there are other reasons to segregate those user accounts.
