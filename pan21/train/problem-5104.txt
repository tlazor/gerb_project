The main benefit of LC over SC is the form factor.  An LC connector is similar in size to an RJ45 jack whereas an SC connector is about twice the size.
Apart from not bothering given most machines struggle to saturate a 1GBps copper GigE link both ways, even then what is going to offer you fully non-blocked transit out of there other than multiple Cisco Cexus 7000/5000's?
It is worthwhile to note that with LC connectors, it is difficult to change the fiber pairs from crossover to straight through.  SC is easier, and ST is obviously trivial.
