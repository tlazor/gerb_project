Connect your raspberry pi to your router/wireless hotspot. Now access the default settings/configuration page of your hotspot by writing the IP (usually 192.168.1.1) from a computer or laptop connected to same hotspot. On prompt, enter username, password.  The default username and password is admin, admin. If not then see back side of your router. After opening the settings page of your router, go for Device info/DHCP clients list or similar option. There you will see the connected devices with your hotspot. Note the MAC address of raspberry pi. Now look for IP/Mac binding option in your router settings page. Add that MAC address of your pi against the IP address of your choice (That is commonly in range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254). Click save and restart your router and pi. Done....
After Reboot, you can access your raspberry pi using the same IP address that you added earlier in router settings in remote desktop connection window of a windows machine or type the same url in browser to access pi server ( in case you have installed server in raspberry pi). You can also assign local static IP to your raspberry pi without accessing your router configuration. There are many tutorials available online for this....Hope it solves your querry..
