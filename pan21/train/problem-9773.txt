I recently switched operating systems from a Mac to a PC. On a Mac, you can drag or insert PDFs into Word documents, and Word recognizes them as vector files. When I open those Word documents on my PC, Word still recognizes those them as vector files, which I know because I can zoom in arbitrarily without loss of resolution, and the document size is not that large. However, if I insert a new PDF into a Word document, it becomes rasterized. Is there a way to force Word to recognize PDFs as vector files on a PC? It seems like it should have the capability to do so because it isn't converting the PDFs that are already in the document.
Do you have a Google Account? Use its Google Docs to open the PDF and download the PDF file as Word, you will be able to insert the PDF contents into a Word.
I do have Adobe, but when I click Insert Object -> Adobe Acrobat Document, the file is getting converted. On a Mac, I think I could insert PDFs via the Insert Picture option, but that does not seem to work on PDFs on a PC.
Would like to avoid proprietary file formats because I'm creating the PDFs in R. I'm using Word 2016 and Windows 10 Pro.
