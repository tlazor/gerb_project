Right click on that new x-axis and select "Format Axis". Under Axis Options, and Axis Position, you will see the On Tick Marks or Between Tick Marks options. Choose the On Tick Marks.
I am trying to lay a line graph (on a secondary axis) over an area graph in Excel. When I have just the area graph, the graph uses the full width of the graph area. When I add the line graph and move it to the secondary axis, gaps appear at the extreme left and right of the area graph.
Then you can go back and turn off the Secondary Horizontal option. This will bring you back to just one normal X-Axis and your lines/areas will stretch from one end of the chart to the other!
I found a workaround for this problem, after trying to apply the suggestion from dav (but being unable to find that setting in Office for Mac 2011).
Had the same trouble, but in 2013/2016 there is no "Layout" tab under Chart Tools anymore. I FINALLY found a solution: 
This will separate out the x-axis so that your secondary axis will appear above the chart grid itself.
