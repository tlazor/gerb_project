If a an Ubuntu system can access the file tree, and read or extract valid files from it, it means that the MFT is not actually damaged, but still somehow corrupted enough so that Windows can't deal with it. I've had one instance where a partition became corrupt on an external HDD, and CHKDSK failed to repair the filesystem. TestDisk also failed to recover the MFT (anyway, the so-called "MFT mirror" only mirrors the first few sectors of the MFT, so there are few cases where this may work). I first saved all the files and folders (using DMDE, a complex but excellent data recovery software), then I examined the partition with WinHex : I discovered that the MFT appeared to be shifted by one sector relative to its expected location. So I made a backup of the first 5GB (normally containing the whole file system structures including the complete MFT â€“ but not always), and first tried to shift the whole MFT by -1 sector, but it didn't work, it was still considered corrupted. Then I restored the backup, and tried to copy only the first sector onto the preceding sector, which should have been the first sector of the MFT but was now empty, and I ran CHKDSK again : guess what, this worked ! CHKDSK did effectively repair the file system and the whole file tree was accessible again from Windows Explorer.
The MFT is a complex and very important part of the file system, which keeps track of all the meta-data from all the files on an NTFS partition, not only their names and attributes, but also the precise location of each and every one of the clusters they occupy. Without the MFT, the files on a partition become an undecipherable bunch of bytes with no structure. Some programs can recover files by examining their so-called "signature", i.e. the header and footer, but if files are massively fragmented the result will be very poor.
MFT is the Master File Table, it's what NTFS uses to keep track of all the file names their permissions, owners, etc.
