Otherwise you risk looking at costing more in periodically replacing equipment than it would have cost to properly protect it in the first place.
When keeping things absolutely quiet is the top priority over keeping your equipment in good working shape, and the proper housing of equipment can't be considered, I'd strongly look at outsourcing your server needs or running fiber/high speed connections to a proper data center or facility. 
It will be nearly impossible for someone to tell you it'll be just fine with a general statement of "it's usually this temp in the city each year," etc. because what about airflow? What about what your office mates insist on setting the thermostat in the office, and that temp flows into the closet? What about processor load on your switch and servers? 
Even with a server of XYZ specs, the temp it runs at differs based on airflow through a rack, through the room, and what load we place on the power supplies/processor/hard disks. In other words, we wouldn't know until it's in the room running in real-world conditions. And you're describing a situation where you can easily find yourself overheating equipment because someone doesn't like the humming noise from the room.
