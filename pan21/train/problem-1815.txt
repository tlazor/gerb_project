I am a novice and looking for help trouble shooting the issue and clarification of any apparent misconceptions I have.
The problem I am having occurs when using much longer wire (15ft) to connect all three (ground, data, and vcc) wires from the sensor to the pi. The DS18B20 is no longer readable, there is no folder named with the serial number in the /sys/bus/w1/devices directory now. I thought I may be losing voltage due to the longer length of the wires but using a mutli-meter I am getting a 3.28V reading at the locations marked with the arrows in the next picture.
I have unshielded CAT5 cable about 40m and 7 sensors DS18B20. GROUND is connected to 2 wires from different twisted pairs, last wires from these twist pairs are used for DATA and power. Between GPIO4 and 3.3v there is a 2.2k pullup resistor and I have correct data from last 2 sensors on the wire while one sensor in the middle always shows 85000. For me it started to work when I changed pullup resistor from 4,7k tu 2.2k. Below there is a grafh of this day and all days from start 
I have a raspberry pi connected to a DS18B20 temperature sensor shown in the diagram below. The one-wire software is installed and I am able to successfully read the temperature from the devices folder/file in /sys/bus/w1/devices.
