This is a pretty deep question, honestly, from a game mechanics standpoint.  But there are a few things that might help.
This may not be a direct answer, but you did ask for general ideas.  So, let's also evaluate the play system.
This leads to a natural balance where the smaller character might be fragile, but avoids being hit as often due to an agility-type ability, and also evens the playing field by doing more damage (a spell, or a poison effect that does damage over time).  The tank might be slower and get hit more often, but often has a huge well of health or hitpoints to sustain, however tends to do less damage per hit (or damage per second).
Add a constant, e.g. 1000, to all attributes concerned. Then the relative difference becomes very small.
First, this is why most games have a separate component for hit and damage, where there's a "roll" to see if you hit for damage, then a "roll" against a damage table or range for the given character.  This also leads to some standard archetypes across genres, where you might have smaller, quicker characters that have fewer hitpoints but deal more damage (glass cannon mages, certain types of rogues) and larger, armored characters that hit for less damage (tanks, warriors).
The background for these is why many games continually go through balancing of weapons and classes and stats.  World or Warcraft, Destiny, Diablo, Battlefield: any type of game in any genre often goes through balancing and tuning over time.
How do those attributes function?  If all else is equal (no archetype, no armor or better weapons or whatnot), then any slight gain is absolutely likely to throw things heavily in favor of one side.  While adding facets to combat complicates any system, it also allows for more flexibility.
