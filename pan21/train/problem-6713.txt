about 1/3 of my pcs are 1 hour behind. If I change them manually they just change back ( the way domain pc's are supposed to).
My network: 2 locations both in Midwest, same time zone. Location 1: 120 pcs (windows xp & windows 200) , with 1 Active Direcotry Domain Controller on Windows 2003 Standard. A couple of windows 2000 servers (they up to date) the rest of the servers are Xen or Debian machines (all up to date) , Second location connected through OpenVPN link  all pc's are running fine - but they are all connecting to our AD domain controller. Locaiton 2: 10 pcs, and a shared LAN NAS. Both of the routers/firewalls in both locations are pFsense boxes with ntp service running - but it's up to date.
The command 'w32tm' is very useful for figuring this kind of thing out. It's the Windows time management tool. 
Run that on an affected machine and it'll tell you what it sees for time-sources. If it shows that the DCs its pulling time from have a minimal offset, and yet the station is still an hour behind, chances are real good that the local timezone files haven't been updated with the DST updates. If it shows one of your DCs as way out of sync with the others, that's where you want to focus your effort.
We just had a summer daylight change in US. and pc's on my network are behaving strange, some of them change time and some didn't.
