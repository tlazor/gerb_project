For Vista and above, the installation process seems to be simple disk imaging, so you can go through the most of the setup until the reboot after file expansion.
We will use sudo- which elevates accounts according to the sudoers file - i assume that its a standard ubuntu system and uses that. if doing this as root, ignore the 'sudo' in front of commands. These commands should work as the user you created during install without any additional work. All this is in terminal, so you can just copy and paste the commands with the appropriate changes.
But if you don't want / can't burn the disk you can use Virtual box to help you. Windows generally doesn't support shifting from one hardware configuration to another, so you have to use the virtual machine to initiate the process and continue the rest by rebooting into the setup environment.
In pre-Vista era, windows setup has two steps -- file copying and install. Normally you get an option to copy all the installation files to a partition and run setup from there. I think you can't do this if you boot from the CD/iso, so you have to find a working Windows PE image first.
I have mounted an ISO file on my Linux machine. It's an ISO file to install Windows 7. It's mounted but I have no idea how to run it. There are EXE files inside, but I don't think I should touch them (even if I try I can't because they are windows EXE files). I really want to uninstall Linux because I can't update or install any new software -- or even connect to the internet. So does anyone know how to run the ISO after it is mounted?
