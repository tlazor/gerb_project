As stated above, your base station should have logging capabilities. Else snort could be set up to watch for alien connections, I believe.
You then point all of your devices to use that proxy server.  This has an added bonus of allowing you to read all SSL traffic in clear text =)
That said, I didn't see any external access to my network so I'm still not sure what is causing my problems. I do plug into a network within my condo that connects thru Dish Network. The Google problem may be a result of traffic being generated by other tenants, but that still doesn't explain sluggish streaming within my LAN.
Regarding possible other users: assign IP to each individual mac address from the base station manager and/or try radius.
I've been having the same problem with Google plus experiencing sporadic streaming hiccups on my Apple TV. After looking around and following a few links here, I ended up referencing traffic via Airport Utility » Base Station » Logs and Statistics. The same dialogs can also be accessed via the Advanced button along the top of the floating dialog box. Here you will find info on devices that have been connecting to your WiFi/Airport and last time each one connected. 
To remotely capture http or https traffic with the Charles Proxy (free to use for 30 minutes) you will need to do the following:
When I tested this out I picked up two lines of a Facebook HTTPS chat (one was a line TO someone, and the other FROM)
Where LOCAL_IP is the IP address of your computer, not 127.0.0.1 as that is the IP address of the emulated phone.
