It works so well I am afraid it is too good to be true and wondered if anyone else had ever tried this.  Their Outlook now boots in a fraction of the time it did take and they no longer have corrupted PST's since the main Outlook.PST is never that large.  The History.PST continues to grow (now over 12 GB), but does not appear to cause any problems or slow down Outlook in any way.
At the company where I work, the owners use POP/SMTP in Outlook to be able to keep an active multi-year history of emailed conversations.  This history cannot be archived by date so they have been creating subfolders in their inboxes and filing the incoming mail into the folder corresponding to the sender's company.  
I figured if anyone anywhere else had ever done this, they could surely be found here.  I offered the normal "archiving" option but was told they don't file by "date' and there is no given criteria I could use for automatically doing this.
They say they must have ALL this mail immediately at hand and easily findable no matter how old it is.  This can mean 6 or 7 years of email.  They constantly have corruptions in their PST and will not remember to run "scanpst" or any other re-organizing tools.
In an effort to solve the problem, I tried creating a second PST called "History" and letting them file their client subfolders in it by using "Move".  This resulted in a 1-2 GB Outlook.PST and a huge History.PST which is never used for anything but storage.
