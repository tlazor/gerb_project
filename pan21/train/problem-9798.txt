Theoretically, I think I could load it with a file 127GB or so in file size and see if that entire file gets corrupted.  Maybe the best choice of file would be a video file chopped and sized to 127GB....
But then again, I don't want to spend ...  20-30 HRS minimum copying this file to the SD card, and then the time to check / delete... and even where to find a video file 127GB in size.  Offhand that sounds like a 24hr+ movie!
I just was offered a huge discount on a 128GB microSD card and before I use it in my devices I would like to check that it will not corrupt my files and I will not lose any data.
In the past I have read some posts by users that they have purchased a SD card from a generic vendor in another country.  Although the SD/microSD card may state that it holds 128GB/512GB, the actual storage space in practice is actually much smaller, sometimes only 1-8GB!
I know there must be an easy way to ascertain the actual storage size of a SD/microSD card regardless of what the file index size states it is.
