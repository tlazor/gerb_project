In the above output, we would ignore the TTLs associated with . and com., because those are not for our domain. The TTLs that interest us are the last two sets, which are both associated with example.com.. The first set is the delegation to the nameservers you had configured in your registrar control panel. The second set is the NS records that live on those DNS servers. To ensure a smooth transition you must use the larger of  these two values, which is usually the delegation.
The duration of this transition period is the largest TTL associated with your domain in the delegation path. This would be the NS records living inside of the nameservers you control, as well as the delegation pointing to it. This is easier to explain visually, and you can find these values by either using the dig command on a UNIX/Linux box (dig +trace example.com), or using similar web based tools that provide the same functionality.
When you log into your registrar control panel and change DNS servers, you enter into a transition period where any recursive DNS servers that are already aware of your domain must pick up the change. The only safe thing you can do is maintain both your old and new nameservers in an identical state until this period expires.
Typically your transition period shouldn't last more than a few days, but it's rare to see ones that require an entire week. If you don't want to get into the technical details of how this process works, a week should be safe. A week also gives you time to notice anything catastrophically wrong with your new environment that might force you to "roll back" to the old servers.
