After updating the ACL of my DB so that Anonymous did not have any access, I was able to do a server auth request through my REST test utility, followed by GET requests to the respective views and the collections of documents returned was now correct.  I don't know why it was related to an ACL change, but seems to have fixed it.
After getting DDS running on our web server, I started testing some REST requests.  The /api/data/collections request does return a list of the views on the DB.
Two views in question are named ClaimedByMe and ClaimedByOthers.  When I look at these in my Notes client, the ClaimedByMe view has 3 documents and the ClaimedByOthers has 0 documents.  If I do a GET against ClaimedByMe it returns an empty list.  If I do a GET against ClaimedByOthers, it returns a list of the 3 documents in the ClaimedByMe view.  I'm not sure why it's getting mixed up like this.  I've verified the UNID of each view being returned by DDS against what I'm seeing in Designer and the UNIDs are correct.  I don't think this is a configuration problem.
