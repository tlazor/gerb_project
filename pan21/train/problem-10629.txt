To run your test3.py program as first program isn't possible because the first program that runs is /sbin/init and that is needed to start all other programs. You have to decide what other programs from the operating system have to run that your program needs to start. You can look at System bootup process what programs when start. A very early point to start your script is just after sysinit.target.
/etc/rc.local is not the best place to start programs on bootup. With old style SysV init system rc.local was meant to start programs as last program after startup. But even that is not guaranteed because with Raspbian Stretch (and Jessie) SysV is replaced by systemd and only emulated by systemd. You have to note that using /etc/rc.local has limitations due to Compatibility with SysV. Following the recommendation of the developers from systemd you should avoid using it.
It would help to troubleshoot your problem if you give us a bit more detail regarding what you have tried to so far. 
But very common to start user scripts on bootup is after multi-user.target, provided it has only text output and not using graphics. This ensures that all programs and setups from the operating system are available to run the script. To do it you create a new service with a unit file. A very simple unit file for your script you can create with:
I am used to autostart with rc.local, after making my program called "test3.py" executable (sudo chmod a+x test3.py). I failed to get it autostarted, means as the first program which the Raspi-stretch has to run.
