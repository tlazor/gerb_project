I think the missing piece is parents starting transform. Meaning the bone was not at the origin to start with, so it should not be animated as it is. I saw you are using parents "animation" transform in the end withing while, but where is the starting point of the bone?
This is the code I use when packing assimp data into my own engine's format. I THINK it should be correct, but since I've already run into problems with matrices (assimp uses row major, glm - column major), I'd rather post this, too:
And here's in my engine. Couldn't capture a gif from my window, so I'll describe it. First, it rotates along multiple axes (bones in the original animation were constrained to z axis), and as you can also see, it distorts. The frame seen below is almost at an end of animation, when distortions are most visible:
I'm trying to implement skeletal animation using assimp and glm. Everything seems to work, except for rotations.
And this is the code that performs the actual transformations (quite a bit of it is based on http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/www/tutorial38/tutorial38.html), but modifications (e.g. storing a list, where each child element is placed after a parent and keeps a parent's id, as was suggested here: http://blog.tojicode.com/2011/10/building-game-part-3-skinning-animation.html) have been made. Scaling and location transforms seem to be working fine, but rotations don't:
