Removing the old versions manually is quite annoying, so before we try to automate it ourselves,  I wonder if there any script that would clean old RPM's based on version (preferred) or time of upload.
If the uploads happen everyday, why not consider deleting the old files which are older beyond say certain number of days(in terms of their access/modification times)? Find and just delete them. If you could have your developers upload builds such that they put the name of the current month into the filename when uploading, it would make sense from the filename directly that the file was uploaded in so called month'year and it makes sense to delete just by the basis of looking at the filename. It would make easy for your script automation to just consider removing those files or just keep those files which match previous month and current month. Just a thought.
Best would be if we could specify to simple save X last versions, and erase anything else. Then we could cron it and just let it run daily.
