Generally speaking, what you want to do is test a lot, especially in the early stages where you're still building your engine. Try to base your game on the most basic features, and leave the functionality that requires the more obscure features optional.
Really, there's no way around this. That's the path you chose when you started making your own engine. If you dislike this, you will probably have a more enjoyable time using a third party engine.
Well, you have it easy. There's only a few hundred models available, with probably a few dozen representative configurations. It's not like most people build their own smartphones, like with custom PCs where you can have trillions of different configurations.
For example, make your game with a single render target. If some of your effects can be enhanced with multiple render targets, then use that on devices that you know support that, but don't make it mandatory for the feature to work, because you will spend all your time looking for workarounds for each different configuration.
