You can build-up an ESX box suitable for this purpose using a high-powered desktop (e.g. 64-bit processor + 4gb ram + storage to replicate your physical disk used on the current directory server.)  I do this quite routinely.  The only real caveat is that you need to have a disk controller and network card supported by ESXi.  I used a Promise SATA300 on my home ESXi server.  Works like a champ!
Don't piddle with Server 2.  Here's what I'd do... build-up an ESXi4 box (will require 64-bit processor and 4gb ram), and then use the coldclone.iso (a.k.a. P2V, or Physical To Virtual) to migrate your eDirectory/GroupWise/AD server off of its current hardware.  Then, install ESXi on that hardware, and move the virtual machine off the temporary ESX host (e.g. FTP)  Total, you'd be able to do this in an eight-hour day (not counting downloading ISO files.)  The result would be, your existing hardware could see the full 8gb of ram the board is capable of, AND it'd be able to use it for your proposed Exchange migration -- which will be greatly aided by the use of snapshots and the like.
