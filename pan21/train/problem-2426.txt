You should be able to find the SAM file from your in-Windows user account before trying it so you can get the proper path.
I use NT Offline Password Recovery to reset passwords and enable accounts on NT-based systems. If you just read the prompts it's pretty straight-forward.
I just removed my vista laptop from domain, but now I cannot login in with local administrator as local admin account is disabled. I have only local user account that works.
You might be able to boot from a Rescue is Possible (RIP) Linux disc, mount the hard drive, change into /mnt/mountpoint/WINDOWS/system32/config (or wherever your particular version of Windows is holding the SAM file), then run "chntpw ./SAM" 
If either of those bother you, or fill you with fear, then add the computer back to the domain, and then enable and reset the local admin account that way.
That application I believe has the ability to enable the account as well as wipe the password. I don't change the password, I just wipe it and reboot to Windows to re-set the password.
