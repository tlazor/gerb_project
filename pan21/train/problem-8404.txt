I assume that for a specific device the changes between time 1 and 2 of the measurements are unique. However, since I am dealing with 32768 bits at different locations, it is quite hard to visualize if there is some kind of dependency. 
I have measurements of 4 devices at two different points of time. A measurement basically consists of an array of ones and zeros corresponding to a bit value at the corresponding location:
As every bit at location xcan be regarded as one dimension of an observation I thought to use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions.
As I am completely new to PCA I want to ask you if you either see a flaw in the process or if PCA is just not the right approach for my goal and I better look for other dimension reduction approaches or clustering algorithms.
However, this gives me really strange results. Maybe PCA is not the right approach for this problem? I also modified the input data to do the PCA not on the logical bit array itself. Instead, I created a vector, which holds the indices where there is a '1' in the original measurement array. Also this produces strange results.
