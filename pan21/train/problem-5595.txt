HappyFingers iPhone app will do what you want.  Sync your iphone contacts to your windows pc, search and select contacts on your pc, dial and send sms messages from your pc.
You could try out myPhoneDesktop ( http://www.myphonedesktop.com/ , I'm not affiliated with them, just a user) or something similar, but you still have to click on "Send" on your Phone...
Getting notifications about incoming SMS on your PC: There's nothing for the iPhone I know of, sorry.
I'm unaware of any way to do that with the iPhone specifically. You may want to look into using Google Voice though - it doesn't have superb integrated on the iPhone (Google tried; Apple rejected their app), but it's easy to send/receive SMS on your computer using your google contacts, and the SMSs get forwarded to your iPhone, and replies on your iPhone get sent back through Google Voice so it's all still in the online interface. I believe you can also sync your iPhone's contacts list with your google account's, so it won't be as smooth as with Nokia, but should work.
I'm afraid but at the moment it is not possible to directly (i.e. without user interaction on the iPhone) send SMS with the iPhone (at least not that I know of any).
About reading the contacts list from your iPhone, I would advise you to sync it (e.g via Google, Yahoo or directly with iTunes and your local list).
The only downside is it uses a generated number rather than your regular number.  However, this is offset by having your messages synced between the iDevice and computer.
I use Pinger on both my computer and iPad.  Its a free service that only requires wifi or an internet data plan.  There is also an app for iOS
