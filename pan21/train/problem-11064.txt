This isn't that big of a deal, you really just need to update your clients drive mappings so that they access by the fully qualified domain name instead of the netbios name.  I haven't looked into the reg modifications you've mentioned, but you'll need to confirm that its a server configuration vs. a client configuration.  I would tend to think those are registry settings you'd need on the client, but I don't know off hand.
I know that you didn't put yourself in this position, but it's your job to get yourself out of it. Managing all of your computers/users through AD had a big initial time investment needed, but after than management becomes a breeze.
Secondly, if you have a domain, this could be much easier, I would then reccomend DFS-N and I would also reccomend using a login script (or group policy preferences) to change the drive mapping.  
There are only so many workarounds that you can do before you need to bite the bullet and fix your environment. Judging by your last question and now this one, you should be spending your time joining the client computers to your domain rather than finding workarounds for the many problems that exist when you have poorly configured workgroup machines accessing domain resources.
