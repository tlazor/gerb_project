Your firewall rules look fine for the server part. If the issue is that, from the server machine (which you'd be using as a client for this purpose), you're trying to connect to a remote SFTP (SSH) server, you firewall rules are wrong.
To be honest, I'm not sure how this works in Windows, but this is what NEW,  ESTABLISHED and RELATED are for in iptables on Linux.
You're opening all your ports to anyone who's able to tweak their client to come from a port 22, which isn't good. What you'd want is to allow only new and established incoming  connections to port 22.
Making an outgoing SFTP connection doesn't mean that the source port is going to be 22 (in fact, it's very unlikely, more so if there's already a server running on that port). The destination port is also going to be 22, but the source port is going to be something usually random (or not too random but within a different range, unused by the server ports in general, let's say > 10000). For outgoing connections, your first rule would still apply, but it would need a different destination mask.
