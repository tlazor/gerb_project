I believe the coaxial cable from your house runs out to the street where it enters a converter on the poll (this converter is probably also shared), where the signal is converted to run through fiber to the station. Whether above ground or underground should depend on your area: rural vs. (sub)urban, and whether or not it has underground wiring for other things.
I'm not sure of the speed provided by coaxial, but I know fiber can be very fast, so if your speed becomes 2Gb/s some day, it'll probably be fiber. I doubt coax can support 2GB/s anyway. Even if it does, if you're paying for 2Gb/s internet, you can probably afford a straight fiber connection.
Most cable internet connections have shared lines for either streets or larger areas. It's cheaper for the ISP, but you don't get guaranteed speed, since you're sharing the bandwidth of the line to the nearest service station with a bunch of other houses. You can pay for guaranteed speed, but it's much more expensive and probably only a good idea for enterprises.
