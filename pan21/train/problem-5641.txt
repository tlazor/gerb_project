I was tasked with finding the same thing in my organization. I set a Group Policy since Win7 and 2008 and later have a policy for blocking USB access by user groups.
I am not aware of any group policies that allow this, however McAfee's device control (and several security products from other vendors) provide this functionality. 
Assuming your clients are all Vista or better, you can use this guide to "whitelist" the set of USB devices your company is deploying and block the rest.  From the article:
Device Management and Installation Step-by-Step Guide: Controlling Device Driver Installation and Usage with Group Policy
Although I successfully blocked USB thumbdrives and Android devices, I was still able to mount Apple iPHone/iPod as storage devices. We also had problems with some users who have laptop docking stations' NICs not functioning correctly. I have since removed this policy and may look in to third party applications for this endeavor. It sounds like you are also wanting to white list select devices cleared by your IT dept., in which case, you may want to look in to a third party solution instead of using GPO alone.

Our company are currently in the process of rolling out authorised encrypted USB sticks. We have now drafted into the IT policy that only company approved USB devices and removable media are allowed to be connected to the computers, however I was wondering if there was any way of restricting the use of USB drive to only those approved for use. Ideally this would involve group policy settings rather than a 3rd party software if possible.
