I had a similar problem and received this advice from my Dr...  The cause was mussel fatigue from keeping my back/torso in the same position for long periods.  The easiest fix is to do sit-ups/crunches and other exercises that move those mussels and those of your stomach twice a week for about 10 minutes.  That and a bit of posture improvement worked like a charm for me.
I have to use computers for 9+ hours per day (no suggestions about 'use your computer less!' please).
I get various kinds of RSI: a little soreness in the hands and wrists, but that's not a big deal compared my main problem:
I am hoping someone with experience can recommend an exercise, treatment, or adjustment in how I use my computer.
Since you mentioned the pain is on the side, it is possible that it is related to your posture. Do you lean on one side when you are working (ie. leaning your elbow on one side constantly)?
If you are using computer for long time per day it is always good to stand up, stretch, and make sure when you sit you are sitting upright. Back straight, and preferably your desk / mouse is level with your elbow (or just below) to ensure that your arm is level with the desk (allowing your arm to rest on the desk)
Driving worsens it. Exercise doesn't seem to help (maybe I need a special exercise). It could be posture related, but I haven't found a way to fix that.
Always best to check with the doctor if it has been constantly happening as Chris Nava said, just in case it is a more serious issue than simply posture issue.
Has anyone else experienced this? I find lots of people complaining about more typical kinds of RSI, but not like mine.
For me I noticed that I tend to lean forward a lot after constantly sitting and working in front of computer. When I noticed myself doing that (sometimes my colleague has to remind me) I would stand up, push my arm above my head and stretch left and right a bit pulling my backbone nice and straight before resuming work.
