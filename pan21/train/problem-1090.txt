there are also Session Hijacking attacks like "Sidejacking", where if cookie-auth structure is not properly handled could lead to compromise of entire web-service without ever leaking the credentials
If an attacker could get the private key then the security is broken, so the private key will never be transmitted. Your pcap will not have it (or if it does, you'll want to go with different hardware as this isn't secure!)
Depending on the hardware, you shouldn't be able to get access to the private key (or for some devices you can through an administrative interface)
It's a little dificult trying to understand the question however to decrypt a ssl connection you'll need to be able to get hold of the private key. If you have the private key available you can get Wireshark/Tshark to decrypt the tcp stream, there is a good example on how to do that at Wire Watcher and Wire Shark.
I am trying to decrypt a https conversation with a hardware device I can't seen to change or download the private key. Is this even possible?
if you are not strictly sticking to H/W ways or cracking Public-Private Key mechanism... there are other ways
say for example attacks like SSL Stripping can compromise credentials if the initial page is viewed at plain HTTP with HTML-page coded with HTTPS link to send Credentials over...
