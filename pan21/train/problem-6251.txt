Based on the information you've provided so far I would suggest that problem is with the MAC address duplication and the disconnections may be from the switch you're ethernet port is going through.
This is on a RHEL5 Xen 3.0.3 server so I am assuming the interface differences are based on changes between 3.0.3 and 3.1.2. That aside you can see that both my eth0 and eth1 interfaces are different MAC addresses whereas yours are both identical. the pethX and vifX.X entries are all virtual interfaces for Xen so the MAC address FE:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF is perfectly fine. 
That said there will be some MAC address duplication. I just checked on one of my Xen servers that I have been working on and I get the following when I run ifconfig | grep HWaddr
The xenbr0 is the bridge that eth0 is attached to and xenbr1 is the bridge for eth1 and use the same MAC address. The virbr0 interface is the bridge for the internal virtual network and has the 00:00:00:00:00:00 MAC because of having spanning tree protocol enabled. You can confirm the bridging on your system by running brctl show which should give you something like:
