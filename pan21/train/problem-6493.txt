The drive not being detected indicates there's an issue with either the cable or the logic board. Considering that you've tried a USB adaptor, we may be able to rule out the cable. The 'brains' of your HDD seem to have fried. I had one of those infamous segates which first started erroring out (did yours?) then dying.
Clicking is usually a sign that you wouldn't be able to get the data without engaging a data recovery company - usually too expensive to justify for a home user.
If it's not detected by your computer's BIOS and/or not resonding to any disk commands then the only recourse would be to get a company with a clean room facility to recover the data. 
That dosen't sound good, and it sounds like you're unlucky enough to have had two different failure modes at once.
You might be lucky using a product to image the disk (like Quetek's Disk Recoup) or copying the data via their File Scavenger product. I was able to get data from a 'clicking' drive but it wasn't clicking that often - I imaged the disk and then retrieved the files from the image. The disk visible in the BIOS and while I couldn't see data in Windows Explorer the volume was still present in Disk Management.
The clicking is the dreaded click of death - thats your hard drive trying to recover from errors. Since the hard drive isn't detected, this might also be related to the other issue, but might also mean physical head damage. If the drive is under warranty, I strongly recommend RMAing it. There's very little you can do.
my hard drive (WD Scorpio Blue 1TB) is not recognized by my Windows 7. The hard drive spins but it clicks every 2-3 minutes and is not recognized by windows using sata to usb cable and sata only. I have a software to recover my data in case the hard drive is detected but I can't get it to sho on that software. I even tried with a live cd but it didn't help.
