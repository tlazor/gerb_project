For MariaDB, I found the account lock feature. Although a locked account can't be logged in as, it can still execute stored routines. As such, the wildcard host could be used to grant access from anywhere while logging in to create the routine(s), and then that user can be locked, allowing it to execute stored routines only. The highly privileged user that performs the locking will of course need to be otherwise secured.
As originally answered, the SUPER privilege simply allows a highly privileged user to set the definer in stored routines to a user other than themselves. You can log in as the definer in order to create a stored procedure, trigger or view under a different security context, but will need to permit authentication as that user so that you can log in when first creating.
On Amazon RDS, you can't lock a user down to localhost only, as you have no shell access to the host. As such, you either lock the user down to a host or range, but will have to keep this in your routine, or use the wildcard host and expose the user to a potential security weakness.
