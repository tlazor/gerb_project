Without knowing more about you're hosting the file, the delay is most likely caused by the time it takes to download the file to the client computer, spin up Quicktime and start playing.  You really only have two options for a file this size.
I have a 49.1 mb quicktime movie file. It's embedded in some object/embed html tags. When page loads, I have it set to autoplay. Problem is it takes 16 seconds for the video to begin playing. I would like it to take under 5 seconds. From the research I gathered, people say you have to compress the file. Some claim though that this reduces quality. Is there a free way to compress quicktime video while preserving quality? If not, what's the best way to compress quicktime video so I can get a good quality video playing on web page under 5 seconds from window load. 
The terms you should search for are "progressive download" and "fast start". They allow the movie to start playing before the whole thing is downloaded. With more details like whether you're working on Windows or a Mac, and whether you want the movie viewable on mobile devices, someone can probably provide more specifics.
