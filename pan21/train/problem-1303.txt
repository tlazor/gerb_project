Basically you need a thin plastic tool to remove the top cover of the mouse and a set of Torx screwdrivers to finish the job.
A much easier method worked for me. If work in a shop and have compressed air, then take off the battery cover, remove the batteries and blast air with a nozzle through the gaps around the scroll wheel. You will see fluff and crud shoot out the bottom. Done.
I was unable to get the mouse cap off for cleaning, but I did fix the malfunctioning wheel by spraying a three or four squirts from a duster can around the base of the wheel.  The vertical scrolling now works!

In my case back button was stuck and I followed instructions here, but loosening its bolts causesaidd win key to fail and vice versa. Turns out the culprit was the rubber over the back button and I didn't need to disassemble it as much. I slid guitar pick between the rubber and button and immediately things were back to normal.
