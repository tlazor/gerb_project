This is assuming that club secretaries have an email address, of course, but that is much more likely than them knowing how to burn CDs.
CDs may be a problem if the recipient has a computer without a CD drive. Also, as mentioned in the comments, you'd need re-writable CDs and the recipients would have to have software to burn files back to CDs. This sounds like overkill in this day and age.
If you don't want clubs to see the details of the other clubs, create a file for each club, post it to the online folder and share each club's file with just that secretary. After they filled in their data you would need to consolidate the different files. 
If you are happy for the club secretaries to see the personal data of other clubs, publish one spreadsheet and share it with all the secretaries, who can then edit the Excel file at the same time and there will be no need for consolidating.
I have made an excel spreadsheet for membership information for a club. I want to make cd's that I can mail to individual club secretaries that can be filled out with the required information (members' names, addresses, etc.) and then returned to me to compile into one document. The disk needs to be readable by both PCs and MACs. I have made the spreadsheet on a MAC using Microsoft Excel:mac 2008. What type of CD to I need to buy to duplicate the blank spreadsheet that I created and also allow for data input from the individual secretaries?
