TheCleaner's answer, which will hopefully remove the need for further action at all.  However, if that does not resolve the issue, a reboot is rarely needed to repair a hung print queue.  Usually, simply stopping the Print Spooler service, killing the spoolsv.exe process (forcibly if necessary), and then starting the Print Spooler service again should be sufficient under most circumstances.  This can also be scripted or achieved from the command line as follows:
As a side note, for as long as the Windows print spooler has existed, it has been very fragile, so I'm rather disappointed to hear that this latest version still hangs for any reason whatsoever (although I can't say I'm surprised either).  Incidentally, the quick and dirty fix methodology above can be employed on every "non-DOS" version of Windows.  Note that although the "taskkill" command was only first introduced in XP, resource kit tool "kill" can be used in its place).
While not ideal, it's not as intrusive as having to reboot the machine just to get your print spooler running again.  You could also be more creative and set up a task that runs every few minutes to see if the print spooler is actually doing what it is supposed to, and if not, then issue the commands above to get it up and running again.
