some motherboards have a native support for 4 or 8 SATA drives, and i'd look for one that has 3-4 PCI expansion slots so you can use atleast 2 of those for cards. then you just network them together as shared access. and 1200W power supplies!
A typical desktop motherboard usually has much 4, 6, or even 8 SATA connections. You can add expansion cards to increase the number. 10-20 drives is likely not to have the physical space to put them in. You probably should consider an external NAS.
alternatively USB through a hub can stack (daizychain) up to 127 devices through one USB port, but that's a lot of wiring nest, NAS w/4 drives per device would be a better alternative. either way your talking quite the expense
now you havent explained what the purpose for so many drives when 4Tb drives are available, so WE can only guess what your up to. possibly considering speed as they could be used for data cache buffers if you were working with huge image files, but still one is good enough for that. so knowing WHY matters unless it is just for storage, then a raid array is only 5 drives at maximum per array for 3x redundancy (2 striped pairs and a third as backup to those). and the only reason for that is if you had a drive size limitation recognized and dozens of 200Mb drives to be used (but then again those would be IDE (parellel) not SATA interconnects.
