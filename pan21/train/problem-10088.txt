When I rebooted, both options were there, but the Linux option was ineffective. I went back into EasyBCD and removed the Linux option - leaving only windows (I planned to install a Linux boot manager instead because EasyBCD seemed a bit iffy). But when I rebooted again - not the Linux option, but the windows option was gone! This obviously raises the question 'did you perhaps change the option to boot windows by mistake? - to which the answer is definitely no, unless EasyBCD did something behind the scenes I wasn't aware of.
My question is, can I edit or reset the windows boot manager config so it does allow me to boot windows 8.1? I do have access to a UEFI shell as well as a DOS environment on a disc that came with my motherboard, however no windows disc. 
So I was left unable to boot either OS from my HD. I went back into the arch DVD environment and installed a Linux boot loader called gummiboot. I added gummiboot's EFI executable to my UEFI boot menu using the Linux tool efibootmgr. Since then I am able to boot arch from the HD, but the problem with Windows Boot Manager remains in that it gives me a broken option to boot Linux, but no option to boot windows.
My problem stems from an attempt to set up Windows 8.1 and Arch-Linux dual boot from a single disk. After creating a partition for Linux and going through the installation using an arch iso image burned to a DVD, I returned to windows. Using a program called EasyBCD, I set up an option to be able to boot Linux as well as windows (or so I thought).
