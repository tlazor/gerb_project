For Enterprise SSDs, we'll have wear-leveling so long as flash cells can wear out at all. For consumer grade SSDs it may go away once lifetimes hit the billions-of-writes range.
We haven't talked sizes yet. Make it a 300GB drive (actually 271GB), and give it a sector size of 512B, and you get a total of 568,328,192 sectors. Assuming 100% random writes, each sector will have to withstand 83 writes over those 3 years. 83 writes.
Of course, you don't go SSD for the size, you get it for the latency and the horribly huge IO-Ops you can pump to them. I've seen enterprise drives claiming to handle 30,000 I/O Ops per second, which is two orders of magnitude better than rotational media. Even then, for that hypothetical 300GB drive, for 100% random writes each cell will get written to only 4997 times over 3 years of operation vs 2.84 trillion times assuming only a single cell gets written to. 
To give you an idea as to what kind of wear a typical enterprise-grade rotational magnetic drive can undergo, take the case of a 15 RPM drive being used in the heaviest storage environment: an OLT database. This thing gets written to all day long for years at a whack. Assuming random writes, this drive can undergo 500 write operations a second. This translates to 43.2 million write operations a day. Give it a 3 year operational lifetime, and it'll handle 47.34 billion writes. 
However, writes are never 100% random. The real endurance of a single sector on a drive will be somewhere in the range between 83 and 47.34 billion writes, which covers the range from 100% random to a single sector getting written to continually for 3 years straight. Until such time as SSDs can endure billions of write operations per cell, complex wear-leveling will still be with us. 
So long as flash cells can wear out from over use, wear-leveling will be with us. As the lifespan of the cells increase it may get less and less complex, but it will still be present.
