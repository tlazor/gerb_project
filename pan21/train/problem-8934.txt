I had the wrong mask in the configuration; swapping 10.13.122.0/22 to 10.13.122.0/23 got things working.
My problem is that with this specific configuration I am unable to see the route to 10.13.122.0/22 when calling route:
What I am trying to accomplish is that traffic to and from the networks 10.20.0.0/20, 10.21.120.0/22, and 10.13.122.0/22 would traverse through eth1 towards 10.20.0.1, and otherwise traffic would go through eth0 and via 10.226.83.1. tun10000 is an adapter generated by our OpenVPN confiuration and that can be ignored in this case.
I have a virtual machine on top of VMware on which I run Ubuntu Server 12.04. I have two network adapters configured for the virtual machine and my /etc/network/interfaces configuration looks like this:
Currently everything except for 10.13.122.0/22 is working fine, which is reflected in the routing table; I cannot see 10.13.122.0/22 in the table even though the route for it was added using the same syntax as for the other two networks.
Even with the two RTNETLINK answers I am getting a functional interface except for the route to 10.13.122.0/22. How can I get this route to work and is there a way I would get rid of the "File exists" and "Invalid argument" messages?
