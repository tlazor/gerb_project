- The question is, that how can i make my subnets alive? I just want to transmit(NAT) some public IP from subnet to specific HOST computer(or inverse?). I have made the NAT rules (zz.uu.156.50 <- 10.10.10.xxx), but no result, the public IP is unreachable(no ping, no traceroute). 
First subnet : xx.yy.81.80/30    (this has the same first 3 octet as the WAN, probably doesn't count, because it is a different subnet)
As you can see in the first diagram, the xx.yy.81.61/26 is assigned to the CISCO's outside(WAN) interface, the internet connection is alive, all hosts in LAN have internet connection. We want to assign some hosts with public IP address (for webserver sake). I'm not familiar with networking, so please forgive me if I make some silly questions. In brackets, I make the cisco router setup with the "Cisco Configuration Professional" PC program.
I mention, that by the original setup, I could access the HP router (just the login interface) from internet with first IP of the subnets (xx.yy.81.81 from the first subnet and  zz.uu.156.49 from the second subnet).
- Do I have to assign a second IP(virtual) address from subnets to the outside interface(WAN). If yes, than how?
The truth is that the original setup was different, as you can see in the second diagram. In this case the both subnet was alive. Based on this I think the subnets is being routed through the WAN IP address(xx.yy.81.61). Now, I unmounted the ISP owned HP router and I attached the CISCO directly to the modem output(first diagram), because we had some DNS issues and I think it is unnecessary to be 2 router sequentially. Please indicate if i was wrong.
