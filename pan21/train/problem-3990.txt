I had this issue with Chrome on a Windows 7 laptop. Some (many) websites would only display basic HTML, other showed normally. My Firefox browser displayed everything normally though. Following TheCompWiz' suggestion I checked my ad-blocker plugin (Adblock Plus). In its Settings -> Advanced menu I clicked 'Update Filter Lists' (hadn't been updated in a while). After updating all problematic websites display normally again. 
This usually happens when Chrome thinks that it has data in the cache that is not actually there (I experience this when I clear the browser cache in the OS instead of in Chrome, but it can also happen if the cache is flagged or not updated incorrectly).
Since you say the issue is transient, and goes away after a refresh, it's rather hard to troubleshoot. 
I'm not 100% sure, but perhaps you're having issues downloading the javascript or CSS for the site.  Sometimes (for big companies) the CSS & javascript are stored on a 3rd party "CDN" (content delivery network)... which frequently end up on "ad-blocking" lists by accident.  Have you tried disabling ad-blocking software?  Perhaps you have some nasty-bug on your machine... and it's redirecting web-traffic.
This happens when the CSS (stylesheet) for that page is not loaded properly. Now, why that happens is a more complex issue. You'll need to do this to troubleshoot that issue:
Refreshing usually fixes it, but if not, then just clear the cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete), then refresh.
It could be a DNS issue, or some transparent proxy acting up, or some other problem. My own company's CDN (content delivery network) provider had issues yesterday, and it manifested itself in a similar way to what you describe here.
