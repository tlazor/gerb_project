I think you're mixing some basic terms. You can still have Wireless-N on the 2.4Ghz band. It is faster than G (theoretically can get up to 300Mbps), although, according to Tom's Hardware the range depends on the radio and antennas and may actually fall shorter.
I do recommend separate SSIDs. This way they are neatly separated. And don't worry - people on the outside whose devices do not support 5Ghz cannot even see that SSID.
I have a dual band router at home. All my devices use Wireless-N: the Macbook Pro and the Lenovo are connected on 5Ghz (although the Macbook tends to switch down to 2.4 when I'm not looking at it - maybe the signal is stronger). The iPods and Android connect to 2.4Ghz.
The 5GHz frequency is basically clearer and freer than 2.4Ghz (which is used by every router, wifi device, phone and, in some models microwave ovens). Getting your device to connect to the 5Ghz SSID is desirable, though not always achievable. Many devices, especially phones and tablets, can only "see" in the 2.4Ghz range. Many laptops, especially in the last year or so, have multi-band wireless adapters (you can verify before you buy).
