Actually if your clients are Outlook (I'll assume that because you said they are looking up autodiscover.xml) you want to use Guessmart for autoconfiguration if you're using POP/IMAP and SMTP.  Guessmart is basically Outlook using your email address and password to try various hostnames using common POP/IMAP/SMTP ports until it finds one it can successfully log into.  It's the same user experience in Outlook as Autodiscover but meant for non Exchange servers.
You can test all this in Outlook by ctrl-right-clicking the notification tray Outlook icon and selecting "Test Email Autoconfiguration".  Uncheck the Autodiscover and test Guessmart to see how Outlook works.
Is there a way to create such a file by myself and serve it on a usual Linux server, pointing to a usual mail Linux server?
Just finished configuring autodiscover on my Linux server. Now mail is setup automatically in almost all possible clients. 
It looks like when setting up a mail account the device/mail client looks for a autodiscover.xml file.
