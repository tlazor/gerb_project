DAS is fine as long as you have no problem with the lack of flexibility coming with this sort of storage.
Many of our (our = the company I work for) customers even run virtualization hosts based on Ubuntu + KVM with RAID 5 disks (DAS) - so far we have had no problems here. We also mirror the data to another virtualization host so there is no problem with moving VMs to another system.
Not sure about KVM, but recent Hyper-V presentations for the new 2012 R2 vrsion have shown that MS is using DAS (Directly Attached Storage) on every node ;) SO, A SAN is clearly not needed for running larger farms of virtualization systems.
So, in short, there's no real answer. Many large installations use SAN storage, and there's a reason for that. But no one can really answer this for your environment except you.
I am looking into setting up 3 kvm hosts. Currently I am using local storage with mirrored drives raid 1 for images. I am also using raw images. I was wondering if this is against best practices and I will need to invest in the SAN unit or its acceptable to use local storage. I am running around 20 vms on each host , mostly web servers like cpanel.
