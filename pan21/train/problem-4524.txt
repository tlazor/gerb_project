While we do have a few water-cooled racks (HP ones actually, don't know if they still make them) direct water cooling is a little old-school these days. Most new large data centres are being built with suction tunnels that you push your rack into, this then pulls the ambient air through and expels or captures-for-reuse the heat collected as it moves through equipment. This means no chilling at all and saves huge amounts of energy, complexity and maintenance, though it does limit systems to using very specific racks/sizes and requires spare rack space to be 'blanked' at the front.
The big disincentive for not using water in data centers is the fact that most water cooling systems are primitive. They all need quick connects to connect the server to the water source in the rack and those are a source of failure, especially as you may have thousands of them in a DC. They also make the servers more difficult to service and in most cases you still need fans. So you are adding to complexity.
On the human side, most facilities managers resist change. They are very skilled with air cooling and a move to liquid would make those skills obsolete. Further every facilities OEM will resist change as it would imply a complete product line redo.
It works just great but its expensive and time consuming to set up for thousands of machines and takes lots of space. Plus its not necessary. Gaming rigs have way to much packed way to close together. Anything with decent ventilation will do just fine with a nice 70f airflow even running 100% which they hardly ever do.
