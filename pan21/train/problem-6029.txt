You can also check the status of the moverequest as it's processing by using Get-MoveRequestStatistics -Identity username
Oh, an additional item:  If when you attempt to use the new mailbox you get an "Unable to open message store", this is the "known issue" I referred to above.  If you have a Database Access Group setup, we've found that failing over the DAG to a secondary server usually clears this up without an info store reset, though in some cases you need to cycle all of the info stores!  Microsoft hopefully will fix this in SP2 (apparently wasn't important enough for SP1)
I would include the "expected" output of the New-MoveRequest verbose, but I don't have a mailbox to move at the moment to show.  Suffice it to say, if you see lots of yellow spam without any red entries, things should be rocking and rolling just fine.
I can speak to how we handle our cross-forest mailbox migrations from our 2003 environment into our new 2010 environment.  This process works reasonably well, except for a known issue that cross-forest mailboxes sometimes need a few hours to be recognized by Exchange 2010 (Or, you can restart the Information Store to get them up immediately)
Here's the process we use.  There are alternate ways to make it happen, but this works for us in a production environment and we do this almost daily.
