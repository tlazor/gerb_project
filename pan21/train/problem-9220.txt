Even though the band starts at 2400MHz, and the channels extend at most 11MHz down from their center frequencies, the center frequency for channel 1 was chosen to be 2412 to leave a little bit of room at the beginning of the frequency to be sure that even poorly-designed transmitters don't accidentally transmit outside the band. A similar thing was done at the high end of the band.
Because 802.11 channels in 2.4GHz are 22MHz wide (802.11b) or 20MHz wide (802.11g, 802.11n HT20), the overlap their neighbors quite a bit. Channels that are 5 channels numbers apart are considered non-overlapping. So 1, 6, and 11 are commonly used non-overlapping channels.
802.11n can use 40MHz-wide channels in 2.4GHz. For that, two contiguous 20MHz channels are used. These are 4 channels apart, so "channel 1 + channel 5", or "channel 7 + channel 11". One channel is considered the "primary" or "control" channel, while the other is considered the "extension" channel. The notation usually lists the control channel, followed by a "+1" or "-1" to indicate if the extension channel is above or below the control. So "1,+1" is "channel 1 + channel 5" with control on channel 1, and "11,-1" is "channel 7 + channel 11" with control on channel 11. But some software that deals in frequencies will list a 40MHz-wide channel by its center frequency. So in the case of "1,+1", the center frequency would be the same as the center frequency for channel 3 (2422 MHz), and "11,-1" would be the same as the center frequency for channel 9 (2452 MHz).
