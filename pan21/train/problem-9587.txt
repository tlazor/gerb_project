Save just what you want to show on playback - if it's just position and heading, fine, if you also want to show stats save that, too, but in general save as little as possible.
Tweak the encoding. Use as few bits as possible for everything. The replay doesn't have to be perfect as long as it looks good enough. Even if you use a float for, say, heading, you can save it in a byte and get 256 possible values (1.4ยบ precision). That may be enough or even too much for your particular problem.
If you want easy rewind, add keyframes (full data, no deltas) every N frames. This way you can get away with lower precision for deltas and other values, rounding errors won't be so problematic if you reset to "true" values periodically.
I'd vote against deterministic replaying. It's FAR simpler and FAR less error-prone to save the state of every entity every 1/Nth of a second. 
Use delta encoding. Unless your entities teleport (and if they do, treat the case separately), encode positions as the difference between the new position and the old position - for short movements, you can get away with far less bits than you'd need for full positions.
