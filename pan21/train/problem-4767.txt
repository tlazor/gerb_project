I bought a Zalman fan with silicone pins with the following instructions (though my fan had no LEDs, thank Linus):
I would put all four into the case first, then position the fan against them, pulling gently as the fan is pushed into place.
You could also use tape. I have just taped fans before and they are still here to this day. Buy good tape if you don't have the screws. 
You sa you have the opposite problem: perhaps you are supposed to really have the pins the other way round? It sounds really weird if the pins included with the fan does not fit the fan itself.
I'm not sure how to install these. They are obvious to install into the case, the rubber pulls easily into the screw hole and stays in place, however the fan they came with they do not seem to fit in the screw holes at all. I put the thin side into the fan and pulled so hard that it actually snapped the rubber, so obviously that is not the correct method.
 (Antec Sonata III at the time). The relevant screw holes in the case were dimensioned for regular 6-32 screws, which already by inspection obviously wouldn't work.
