Having all your users connect using a sysadmin-privileged login (even if it is one other than sa), is, to put it mildly, far from ideal.
The impact is a very severe security risk. It might be that your application is hard-coded to use 'sa'; often very poorly written and implemented 3rd party apps do this kind of awful thing.
The question you need to ask is, "what can I do to fix this?", because it definitely needs fixing urgently.
I found out that on an instance of a certain SQL server at my company- sa is virtually the only login used by all the sessions. The SPID# extends to 130. What do you think is the impact of this? Is there any downside despite of course security? Appreciate you pitching in on this. Thanks. 
Ideally you will create a new database role, assign minimum required permissions to that role [e.g. exec on certain Stored Procedures] , then create logins/groups for your users, add them to this role, and modify the application's connection settings to use their own logins instead of sa.
You should also then create a new sysadmin login NOT called 'sa', for your own use, and then if possible, remove sa itself from the sysadmin fixed server role, and/or disable it.
