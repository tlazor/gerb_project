What you will need to do is to highlight all the values, then go to Home tab, then Format as Table. Once you have done that, you can just sort things out by clicking on the header.
Itâ€™s really very simple; first select the column that need to be shorted followed by clicking on short button then a  short warning message will be displayed, just select the expand the selection and confirm by clicking on message short button, you done.
Highlight the column header (first row). In Excel 2007/2010, go to Data and click Filter. This applies a filter to each column that can be used to sort. Click the downward arrow in the column by which you want to sort and and sort as appropriate (in your example, you would click Smallest to Largest). 
considering that , all alphabetical values are in column A and numeric values are in column B .....then to get your desired o/p  as stated in que. while selecting columns first choose column B (because base of your sorting is column B ) and then column A and after selection click on sort lowest to highest . you will get your o/p if and only if u follow the sense of selection........
