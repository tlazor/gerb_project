I would also point out that I did this exact same thing when I bought a new computer to replace an old one.  So I know it can be done.  I ghosted the image, restored it to the new computer, and all I had to do was re-enter my key and re-activate my Windows XP the first time I logged in.
This is indeed possible.  It's done in corporate environments all the time.  The problem is that when you run Windows XP on the new machine, if you are using an edition that is not a corporate/volume license version, the system will recognize that the hardware has changed and you will be required to re-validate/re-activate Windows.  This will likely work once or twice via automated means.  If you keep trying to do it, you will likely get a response requiring you to call Microsoft to justify what you are doing.
I should point out the obvious that if you migrate your Windows installation to a new computer and you keep using it on the old computer, this is a violation of your license and is illegal.  You must own a separate license for every computer you intend to use Windows on.
