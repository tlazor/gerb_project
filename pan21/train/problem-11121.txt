The BSSID (basic service set identifier) is what you seek.  Numerous wireless troubleshooting apps (e.g., Wifi Analyzer) will show the associated BSSID.
You may be able to go the the MAC table of the switch that your access points are using. If the MAC address of the device you are seeking shows up on a port that has one of your APs, then you're in luck, and have found the device you're looking for!
Is it possible to find out the MAC Addr of AP the device used to connect the network? I can get the MAC address and IP address of the device(maybe notebook or smartphone), and I have to check the MAC address of the wifi device. (I'm not saying about the gateway address) There are lots of AP with same ESSID and different channels here, and I want to get which AP was used.
If your network uses 802.1x with Radius, you can also retrieve this information from the Called Station ID field in the Radius request. Even better, by default this will give you both the AP MAC and the SSID name the device connected to... very handy when debugging complex environments.
