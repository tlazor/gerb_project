From your log, it appears likely that their mailserver flaked out after receiving the first line of the email content, and that every line in the email after that was interpreted as a new command - which failed, since they're not valid SMTP commands. 
SMTP transaction is involving two parties here, sender and receiver. Both servers must have some agreement when they talk each other. When one server complain about protocol disagreement like above, them either your server or their was misconfigured.
I'm guessing that you did a copy-paste of the email contents; if you'd pasted one line at a time instead of the entire email, you would have gotten the error message immediately after that first line, and you would not have gotten the rest of the error messages, which would have made the problem a lot clearer.
Since it's their mailserver that is having the issue, not yours, there's nothing you can do to fix it. You'll have to wait, or possibly phone them.
To debug it, try to send email to another server. If you're the problem, then you will fail to talk to the others. Also try to send email to your receiver via another mail server. If another server has same problem too, then perhaps the receiver was misconfigured.
