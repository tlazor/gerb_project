The IP with .252 at the end is 11111100 in binary, so your transformation from dec to bin is incorrect.
You have 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100(B) as the subnet mask, which leaves two bits for the host address, 2^2 is 4, so 4 possible addresses.  Since you can't use all zeros (network id) and you can't use all 1s (broadcast message) you have (bits^2) - 2 => (2^2) - 2 => 2 usable addresses.  This may or may not be cut down by your router, which would be one usable address for your computer.  My guess is you're stuck with this because of this is how your ISP does things.
0 bits in a subnet mask are available for hosts, but not the first or last address.  So add up all the value of each column that is 0, then subtract 2 to find the number of hosts.
the first binary digits = 0 for class a, 10 for class b, 110 for class c, 1110 for class d and 1111 for class e (experimental). you have class b. which default subnet is 255.255.0.0. So to determine you should convert intp network info use the 2'n-2=y formula. (y= the number of subnets you want to create) (n= the number of host bits to be converted to network bits) ex. you want to create 14 subnets. 2'n-2=14. 2'n=14+2. 2'n=16. 2'4=16. 4 is the amount of bits you need to take from the default subnets host area 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000. you can determine how many host are available by the 2'n-2 formula (n= the number of zeros there are) 2'12-2 (-2 for the network ID and Broadcast ID) = 4094 available host for a subnet of 255.255.240.0.
Subnet masks do not have to be 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, or 255.255.255.0.  The 1 to 0 boundary can fall on any bit between 31 (left most, or most significant bit) or 0 (right most, or least significant bit).
(*) 10.x.x.x/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.x.x/16 are non-routed IP addresses, meaning you should never see them on the great Internet, just on your local LAN.  You need some kind of gateway, such as NAT, to actually have your traffic on the 'real' Internet.  You can still route these internally though, say if you wanted your own second network.   
A more compact and easier form of writing the subnet mask is to write a slash, then the number of 1 bits, this is called CIDR notation and is now what is used.  (/32 means a single IP, and your formerly classful masks above would be /8, /16, and /24).
Well, you are part of a subnet, specifically the subnet 255.255.255.252. You can have a class A IP from a network which has subnets.
Part of your question is that you're confusing your subnet mask with what you read the default is for your class of address.  Yes, 10.x.x.x is a class A network, and when interacting with other networks(*) it has a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0.  But internally you're able to subnet as you see fit.  You really don't want to have 16777214 (2^24 - 2) hosts on the same network segment.  You really want to subdivide traffic on those 16 million hosts.
