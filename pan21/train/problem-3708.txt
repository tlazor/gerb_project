I have a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 v2.0 that was bought paired with a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000. They're both Bluetooth and use the same receiver.
The keyboard no longer works. The receiver is fine, as the mouse still works. The keyboard is still detected by Windows when the receiver is plugged in. The batteries have been replaced. There are no on/off switches on the keyboard or mouse, and no re-sync button on them or the receiver. Results are the same when using the receiver in a different USB port, or on a different machine.
This setting states it is to 'ignore or slow down brief or repeated keystrokes and adjust keyboard repeat rates' ... immediate result, keyboard was working in 1-2 seconds.
My problem with the Microsoft wireless keyboard 3000 v2 not working was the battery power indicator not on. the battery contact (especially the spring had corrosion.  I cleaned the contacts installed  the batteries and it works
In my case like above the mouse had always worked, the keyboard had been in the cupboard for about a year and I was trying to use it with a new system.
I just had the same problem, was about to give up and throw a perfectly good keyboard in the round tin when I found this 'Filter Keys' post.
