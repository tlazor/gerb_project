You might be alble to use this same hardware if you connect the Pi's 3.3 V pin to Vin on your shield.  Before you try that and maybe burn up more hardware, however, you should read the specification for the shield.  Look to see if the shield can operate on 3.3 V, and verify that this connection results in 3.3 V at the GPIO pins.
If you're unsure though, I'd get a motor driver designed for the Pi.  That won't be super-expensive and may be less frustrating in the long run - especially if you burn another device trying to make the Arduino shield work on your Pi.
I agree with the answer by CoderMike that you've probably fried your Pi.  Based on the wiring diagram though, I differ in thinking that it might have been avoidable with this hardware if you had connected it different.
You put 5 V into the shield's logic circuits by connecting the shield's Vin to the 5 V pin on the Pi.  That's the orange-ish line near the bottom of your figure.  You probably then got that same 5 V level running through your GPIO pins, which, as CoderMike said, is going to damage your Pi.
