Under Unix, it is useful to perform operations that are restricted to just textfiles.  For instance 
The only odd time that I add an extension, is if I know the for a particular file I'll specifically want to open in something that I normally do not use (like Notepad) in which case I'll append an extension (like .doc) to the filename so that it will open in the default application (Notepad, for me).
In general, I always know what is in my files, & generally always open files from within a file manager, either to view (happens to be F3) or to edit (happens to be F4) or from a context menu (to open in Vim).
Assuming you are on Windows - if you don't put a file extension on, then it won't automatically open when you double click it.  It is certainly "strongly encouraged."
If you want to perform an action on a set of files (as mentioned above) & if having an extension such as .txt helps, then I would do something like that for that set.  (I do something similar, though instead of an extension, I have numerically numbered sets of files, so I can select 7* to get all the files that start with the number 7, to process them further.)
will search for foo in all of the text files under the current directory. Even if you don't do this often, it is useful occasionally.
