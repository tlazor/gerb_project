4- What's the worst case in this kind of situation?  Assuming no permanent attachment, the worst that can happen is being required to pull the cable and re-run it using a licensed installer.
Currently, I am investigating Oregon and have found that several licenses are needed to provide the same service.  First, each individual must have a LEB license.  Second, one person must have a LEC license.  Third, a CBC license is also required.
I have a company in Utah that provides low voltage cabling, networking, telephone systems and paging.  Utah does not require any licensing to provide this service to our customers.  
2- You would need to see the building department in your jurisdiction for a specific answer.  You would also be able to find out whether a permit is required for the job in question.  The two questions are not necessarily connected.
If the majority of them won't fax one to you, it probably isn't a requirement (or at least one that isn't observed).
3- Whether a licensing requirement is rigorously enforced or not is a completely separate matter. My suspicion is that if a job is being permitted and inspected, the licensing status of the sub-contractors matters, otherwise not.
1- Almost certainly data/ethernet/cat5/cat6 cable falls under the "low voltage" umbrella.  If a license is required to run coax or alarm cable in a building, it is required for Ethernet cable.
You might want to call a bunch of companies/independents that do low-voltage wiring and ask them for a copy of their license (you want to make sure they are licensed before you get a quote---wink, wink).
