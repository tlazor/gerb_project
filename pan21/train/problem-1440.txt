Windows 7 does not natively support voice biometrics for login purposes, it is considered a security risk by Microsoft & as such (as you mentioned) the voice recognition software can only be launched once you are logged in to the operating system.
I upgraded from Windows XP (where I used Microsoft Fingerprint reader), but Windows 7 doesn't have any drivers for that Microsoft Device so I am wondering if anyone has found a way to use voice recognition or voice biometrics to log onto a Windows 7 system. I don't want to have to use a program that uses a cell phone to remotely access the system, just something that will recognize my voice at the login screen and let me in.  I know that to use Microsoft Voice Recognition you already have to be logged into the computer, so that won't work.
Thank you for all the helpful answers.  I ended up going with FastAccess face recognition.  It works well, and stores multiple recognized faces for you, with glasses, without glasses, etc. so it does a pretty neat job of recognizing. I couldn't fool it with a picture either. It works great.
