I had several new hard drives that showed increasing Current Pending Sector Counts.  The count would be fixed at one value for a few hours or a day, then it would jump up to a higher value and stay there for a few more hours or so.  Believing that the pending sectors might turn out to be good, I continued using the drives.  Each drive failed within a week, losing data.  Since these were brand new drives I was able to get them replaced by RMA from the site I ordered from.
Current Pending Sector Count is a count of suspected bad sectors on the disk (a sector is a contiguous section of the drive).  The drive attempted to write data to those sectors but it couldn't, so it wrote the data elsewhere and placed these sectors in reserve to be tested later.  If the test is successful, they will go back into the pool of good sectors.
I would discard the drive and replace it as soon as possible.  If it's still under warranty, I would get the manufacturer or the place you bought it from to replace it.
