2) Making sending and receiving directional. (What you mentioned as "the antennas are to be phased and used as one").
There are routers that are specifically made for outdoors and have directional antennas, e.g. the TP-Link CPE210 or the Ubiquiti Nanostation. Investing in one of those might make more sense than worrying about MIMO. :-)
The wikipedia article on 802.11n has a good overview on MIMO, and for in-depth details you can read the standard itself. However, what part of the standard is actually implemented, and how well, depends heavily on the firmware of the router etc., so there's no alternative to trying it out.
As for "what is the best way to go", you don't really have much choice: All antennas will already be exploited for directionality, and the environment is the way it is. The only parameters you can really influence is (a) which router hardware you use, (b) the position of the antenna and (c) which antenna you use if the antennas are detachable. None of these have anything to do with MIMO proper.
1) Simultaniously transferring several streams of targets to different peers (doesn't apply for your case).
Your trees very likely won't cause multipath transmissions, so the effect of moving trees will just be varying attenuation of the signal. However, other features in your environment may cause multipath transmission, for example buildings a bit off the direct path between transmitter and receiver.
3) Taking advantage of multipath transmissions arising from reflections in the environment etc. This will show up in the receiving antenna as multiple packets received from different directions at different times, so the receiver will decode all of the packets and keep the one with the best quality. This is very different from "monitor all antennas and use the one with the best signal".
