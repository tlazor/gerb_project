There is built in app for Samsung laptops & netbooks called Battery Life Extender which will limit charging to 80% in order to extend battery life. Try and find out if it is available for your laptop.
Don't block the cooling vents on the laptop. That means using it on a hard surface. A cooling pad is even better.
If you can't find an app, the only option is what I do in my ASUS G53, manually unplug it when it charged to 80-85% and replug when it is 20-25%. BatteryBar is Taskbar widget with modifiable settings for reminding you of ideal range.
34C (93.2F) is pretty hot for the outside of a computer. I don't know if it will preserve your battery specifically, but I think a cooling pad is a good idea anyway. I think it will help preserve your laptop as a whole.
On the other hand, you can increase the life of a LiIon battery by setting the charger to not charge to 100%, but stop at 60-80%.  (Though, to keep the "charge meter" calibrated you need to discharge to 20% or so then recharge to 100% every few months.)
You are right. In fact in EV cars(tesla etc) specialized firmware maintains charge between 30 & 80%. The battery never actually chrages upto 100%. It is also liquid cooled. This is to increase the life time of the battery. So two things are actually important: Heat and 100% charge. Both are harmful. You should not use it always at 100% charge, which is what will happen if you are always plugged in to AC adapter.
I don't know about LiIon batteries, but NiCad and NiMH batteries do not like to be hot, especially when charging.  Charging a hot NiCad or NiMH is a good way to kill it.
