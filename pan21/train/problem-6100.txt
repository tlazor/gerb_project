Similarly the Packets-Per-Second (pps) numbers for the box are listed as 104.16Mpps, which equates nicely to line rate: 
Secondly I have heard reports of some early switches which have 10G ports but which can't handle a full 10G for a single flow because of their internal forwarding design.
I don't think the default gateway has anything to do with your problem. Local traffic between two devices on the same subnet doesn't flow through the default gateway and in any case the speeds you are reporting for your local traffic are 10 times higher than the speed you report for the link to your default gateway.
It mentions switch being capable of "140Gbps" of throughput - using typical marketing "full-duplex" numbers this would mean that on a 50x1G and 2x10G switch like the 1510-52 that the switch is capable of running line-rate through every interface simultaneously.  Eg: (1Gbps x 50) + (10Gbps x 2) = 70Gbps x 2 (Full Duplex) = 140Gbps.
Firstly are you in the correct ports? from some searching it seems only two of the four fibre ports on that switch are 10G.
The one thing you might want to confirm though is that there are two 1G SFP ports and two 10G SFP+ ports, so make sure that you are connected to ports 51 and 52 on the switch and that you are seeing Orange LED status on both ports (which means 10G).  If you're seeing Green LEDs this means you're only getting a 1G link.
