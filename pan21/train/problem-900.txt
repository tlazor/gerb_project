Restoring the needed user and application directories from the backup medium. This avoids the drawbacks of bare-metal, but comes with a drawback of its own: you'll have to be able to define the backup directories. On a newish server, this might not be a problem, but if your system is some old piece that was once set up by that guy who is no longer with the company and that nobody has dared touching the last two years, that can be a serious issue.
