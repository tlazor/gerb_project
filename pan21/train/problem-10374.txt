Have you tried using ethernet directly to see if it still happens? If it does we can rule out anything to do with wireless directly. Try watching your signal strength when the issue occurs, it could be interference. I have a friend who's wireless signal would cut drastically, allow existing connections to work, and prevent any new connections from being made when he or his wife opened their garage. Changing the channel the router was using fixed the issue. (Their garage frequency was on the equivalent of channels 6 and 7 on 802.11b/g)
I was running into precisely this same problem with similar hardware (Linksys WRT54G2v1.0, but MacBook Pro), and went through all the same gymnastics you did, with little or no success. 
This is old now, but one possibility to explore is to check the proxy settings in internet properties. For Windows XP:
By luck, I managed to discover the root of the problem in my case: it's wireless interference from another device in our house. (In my case, it was the baby monitor -- but cordless phones seem to be another likely culprit.) Did you recently get a 2.4 GHz phone, or did one of your neighbors (if you live in an apartment building)? Either way, there's a really easy fix: change the wireless channel your router is using. In my case, this completely solved the issue. 
Start Menu -> Control Panel -> Internet Properties -> Connections tab -> Lan Settings button -> make sure the Automatically detect settings option is not checked.
