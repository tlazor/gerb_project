The specific example you have would be very difficult, and probably wouldn't work if two directories had the same name.
"z in" would cd into /home/user/mail/inbox as the higher weighted entry. However you can pass multiple arguments to z.lua to prefer a different entry. In the above example, "z w in" would then change directory to /home/user/work/inbox.
Tab autocompletion of the path after cd isn't fast enough? Usually it only takes me 5 or 6 keystrokes to get where i need to go that way.
pushd pushes your current directory onto a stack, then cd's to the argument directory.  The stack can be as large as you want.  popd removes the directory on the top of the stack and cd's to it.
And then you can input the number and choose where to go before actual cd. eg. input 3 to cd to /home/data/software. And if you just press ENTER and input nothing, it will just quit and stay where you were.
Save it as a batch file, put it on your path (\system32, for example), and then you can type, say "go docs" to go to your documents. You could write a small program to help manage them, if you want, too.
