The Homeworld Engine is available and open for use. Though I'm not 100% sure about the license for distribution. I would say that the Homeworld engine would be a great place to start for a Homeworld Style game. It it is free you are after look no further.
Apparently, Unity Pro comes with a couple great performance tools that might come handy when drawing your game scenes too.
Unity has a strong community, support and good documentation covering all the supported languages. Worth giving it a go. Learning may take a while thought.
Unity is fairly easy to use, may take a small while, but it is worth it. Learning it can be fast thanks to UnityAnswers, a site stackoverflow-styled where you can ask pretty much anything about Unity and they usually answer pretty quickly.
Unity is pretty interesting, you make prefabs of your game objects and put them in your scenes. Performance is good, and I believe networking is fine as well.
It has great water surface assets, real-time lighting, tree creator, landscapes, skyboxes, a nice way to "expose" variables and quickly edit them without going directly into the code, nice HUD system, etc.
There is also the Asset Store. You can buy graphic packs or other code projects, in case you need a boost somewhere in your game development.
