I have heard the term "popping and boiling" applied to the aliasing you're showing on that mountain in the background. It is not a mathematical term, but it is descriptive. So aliasing would be what you'd write your paper about if you wanted to invent a different fix for the problem and use it to get money (grants, academic promotion). "Popping and boiling" might be what you'd call it in a demo (for VC money).
I'd just like to add that there's another side-effect of not using mip mapping: Not only will you get the hideous aliasing (see the Nyquist theory for what is going on), you will probably also get a reduction in performance as the texture accesses become incoherent and thrash the memory/cache system of your GPU.
What you're looking for is aliasing. It's little different from aliasing of hard 3d edges drawn on screen. Both come from rendering pixels too strictly, with one color or another. Antialiasing methods like mip-mapping only help blurring the edges so that intermediate colors are rendered. This can be applied to single textures but also to the whole screen.
Note however that mip-mapping is not the only solution to this. You can use other procedural interpolation algorithms too.
