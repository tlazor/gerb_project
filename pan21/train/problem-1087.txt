Contacted Telenet helpdesk twice. The first person wasn't helpful at all, so I called again later and got somebody else on the line. She admitted that it was possible that Telenet blocked the domain, but she could not check that from her desk, and will report back later. 
(*) Several Belgian ISPs blocked all The Pirate Bay's domains sometime this summer, so maybe yesterday they found out about a TPB mirror (or other illegal content) under the same SLD as my domain.
Which leaves the question why for Pete's sake Telenet would do this. I'm not that paranoid to think they would purposefully block just my domain. The only explanation I can think of is that one of the domains hosted by my webhost contains unlawful content (*), and that instead of blocking that domain they blocked the complete SLD.
IMO the trace route points at Telenet as the culprit: the request seems to die in one of their servers. I asked a couple of friends to try and access the site, and none of the Telenet customers could reach it.
