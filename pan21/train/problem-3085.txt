The point of that story is that they could just as easily have decided to apply SPF tests to all the relays prior to final delivery.  You don't know what boneheaded stunt some idiot is going to pull.  You can only honour the RFCs (as you are), hope for the best, and deal with the worst when it arrives.
As proteus has said, the record you have shown should be enough to certify the email as coming from you; it certainly satisfies RFC 7208 as I understand it.  But I have known some large organisations reject email because of the servers it has passed through on the way out of my clients' networks.  They shouldn't have been doing any kind of checking on the Received: from headers other than the one that led to final connection, but they were.  In that particular case, one of the internal servers had an unqualified hostname, and the footprint that left in the headers caused the recipient to reject it.  They were awfully sorry when this was pointed out, but (as is so depressingly common these days) they had outsourced their email and so had no control over this decision.  We ended up having to set up full internal DNS to enable emails to go through to them.
All my mail got routed through a Mail Gateway. Everything goes first to this server and then relayed to the internet.
I always put all my Mail Servers in SPF declarations, but I'm not sure if this is the correct way to implement SPF.
There's no way to say, because you have no control over whether someone else decides to accept your email.  They can, and sometimes do, decline your mail for reasons which are RFC-violating as well as dumb.
This should be enough. Any server on the internet would see only your gateway as the originator of the email and won't care about any internal servers the mail originated from.
The question is: Considering that the Mail Gateway is my MX record in DNS and with this architecture should I wrote the SPF settings in this way:
