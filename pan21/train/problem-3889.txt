Setup password for root with "passwd root" and login as it over SSL. If you want to host website you might try virtualmin.
Create a webmin user password like so: /usr/libexec/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root YOURPASSWORD. Then you can login as "root" with the password you set without adding a system-wide password to your machine root user.
I've setup an Amazon EC2 Instance, using the Ubuntu 12.04 AMI (ubuntu/images/ebs/ubuntu-precise-12.04-amd64-server-20120424 (ami-a29943cb)), and I'd like to get Webmin working (so I can setup a DNS).
The problem is that the EC2 instance only has 1 user "ubuntu", which can only login using SSH keys -- not a password!
Ok, so the reason you can't log in to the instance with anything other than a key is probably the sshd_config has PasswordAuthentication no
I've tried creating users manually and I can't login as those users (even via SSH), so I think it might be a permission thing provided by the AMI.
After following the installation instructions on Webmin's site, the installer says I can login with any username/pass of a user who has superuser access.
