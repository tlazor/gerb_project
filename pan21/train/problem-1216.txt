There's no reason for these variables to be declared at a class level, you only ever use them within a single function:
It looks like you're only expecting a single client (your listen thread doesn't contain a loop to accept more than a single connection).  Rather than spinning up another thread to perform the receive functionality, you might as well be doing it in the same thread that you performed the listen on.
If the user clicks on the send button, before they've clicked on the Listen button, your client member won't have been initialised so will throw an exception when you do:
Your listen code doesn't check the state of the Server before calling start.  If you click it twice, it seems likely that this is going to cause a problem.
You don't have any exception handling around your read/write calls.  TCP can be a bit of a pain at times, depending upon how the connection has been shutdown it may throw various exceptions rather than just returning 0 from the read call.  It's also worth remembering that since you're accessing the socket from multiple threads it can change state between your is connected call and your write operation.
