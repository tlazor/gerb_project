I found this thread looking for a real-time way to display spectra-versus-time, after losing the ability to use Adobe Audition, WHILE recording.  In Audition, you can do a spectral display that has very little delay; as someone else said, if you use high resolution, there will be more delay.  But a "good" program will use overlapping blocks of data so it can update the display very quickly.  There's enough processing power in modern processors to keep up with a thousand frequencies in a fraction of a second of processing time, if the program is well written, and there's no point in more resolution than that if you're displaying on a screen that's "only" about a thousand pixels high.  I'd submit that for stereo, 1k blocks of audio samples is plenty, unless you're expanding a part of the frequency scale as you can do in Audition.  Recording at 44k samples/second, you get a whole new 1k block 44 times a second, and for me, that's plenty fast enough, without even any need for block overlap.  Even 8k blocks would be more than 5 a second without overlap.  Whether the software is written well enough to actually DO that is another matter.
Using the Volume Mixer isn't enough (right-click the speaker icon in the taskbar and select "Volume Mixer")? It will show level meters for all sounds being played through the system, and should include microphones as well.
Audacity does allow you to monitor the input from the mic without recording. Don't know if this would reduce/eliminate the delay you experienced, though:
"either select "Monitor Input" from the input meter's pop-up menu, or else just click on the input meter." http://audacity.sourceforge.net/onlinehelp-1.2/toolbar_meter.htm
