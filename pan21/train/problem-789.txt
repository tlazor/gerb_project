I have now re-created this computer object with it's computer name but still cannot login and get the same error. Shouldn't I be able to login now that the computer exist or would that object have a different SID that doesn't correspond to the machine?
So the question I have is... why would this machine not be able to authenticate if I have re-created it in Active Directory?
I don't know if this was deleted but I checked ldp.exe's deleted objects and didn't see it. It must have existed before if it is on the domain. 
We cannot login as domain admin on one server but can on others. When I looked at Active Directory, I can see that the computer object doesn't exist for the server we can't login to. There is, however a DNS record with the proper computer name.
Also, I tried adding this server to the server group in Server 2012 but it is not found in Active Directory yet for some reason. I did, however find it by DNS in "add servers" but get a kerberos error of "kerberos target resolution error." The details show "Cannot find the computer xxxxxx.domain.local" even though it found it by DNS when adding.
