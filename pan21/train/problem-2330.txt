I've probably made many errors but it's working and that's important for me at this point of my game development. Criticism and suggestions are welcome.
If you then want to blur it, you will need to filter your image using one of many blur functions and a convolution matrix. This is typically done as a post processing step in engines, and it involves rendering a quad the size of the screen to a texture, while sampling the original back buffer image as an input.
A note here, this isn't a trivial thing unless you have sufficient experience with your rendering pipeline, and it would be far too much code to simply demonstrate the entire process.
I have no source code to provide you, but I will point you in the correct direction. "Taking a Picture" is a simple task when rendering a game, you simply need to make a copy of the back buffer before it is swapped at the end of the render stage of your game loop. 
Here is a link to the theory behind a Gaussian filter, and how it can be used to produce a blurred/smoothed image in the general context of computer vision.
