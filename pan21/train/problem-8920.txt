There is software like SPLVIEWER that lets you view print spool files. Hence, if the admins have access to your spool files, they can view them. This means that, if you print via a server it's possible.
There is still the possibility that the print files are held on the printer, but that is rare. Only printers with an internal Hard Disk Drive can do that - but even then most of them do not. If there is no HDD, then the printer forgets the document as soon as it is printed.
If we print documents in an office network, are they stored somewhere on the servers or can network admins access those documents at some later point in time ?
They would need to do it while the files are available. That means they need to either do it while you're printing, or they can set the server to keep the spool files after the job is finished, and view them at their leisure.
If you're using a permanent networked computer (like a company desktop, as opposed to your personal laptop) then I would expect that the network admins can browse through every file on the whole computer (and monitor all network traffic too - https would be slightly harder to view, but still possible since it's "their" computer), and see & review printed documents too.
If you print direct to the printer (to its IP address) instead of via a server, then the spool files are on your own PC and the admins usually have no access to them. At the very least you can make sure they are deleted. Of course, if your organisation is paranoid enough, your PC may be set up such that admins have access to every file at all times. In that case, the spool files are the least of your worries!
