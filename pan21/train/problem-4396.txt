Note that under Windows, you have to install different disk controller drivers to match different SATA modes and I suspect some RAID mode drivers may be better/worse than AHCI drivers. (On my AMD SB710 chipset, the RAID driver seems to be slower.) Or maybe computer vendors recommend you to use RAID mode so you won't have reinstall to drivers if you switch to RAID (through eSATA or second drive bay?).
If you use Windows and is not afraid of blue screens, you can switch between these two modes and use disk benchmark software to determine which mode is more efficient. Make sure you change your driver first and then change the mode in BIOS.
I just installed a Samsung PM853T 960GB SSD as the primary drive in my E6520.  The SATA operation mode was set to the default RAID selection.  I cloned the original 1TB HDD with Acronis TIH's clone utility.  The initial boot failed but the second boot and all subsequent boots have been flawless both for the first partition (Windows 10 Pro) and second (Windows 7 Pro).  The PM853T is a data center oriented drive.  I am getting 540/430 MBs performance, which is what the Samsung specs call for on this model.  
Advanced Host Controler Interface (AHCI) is the best option if you have only one Hard Disk (or Solid State Disk). It provides the best interface to SSD-Operational System transfer rates for reading and writting. More information about AHCI you can find here.
Adding my experience for anyone searching. Dell E6520, fresh Windows 10 install on new single SSD. Windows 10 would only start with the install DVD. Changed BIOS from RAID to AHCI then got the blue inaccessible device error. Performed a reset from the install DVD and problem is fixed.
