Other protocols like EIGRP or OSPF assume the best way to get somewhere is the fastest link -- i.e. the link with the highest bandwidth.  As such, they have a simple metric for selecting routes.
In many situations, especially between different organizations (autonomous systems), the reason for choosing a particular path may have nothing to do with bandwidth.  It may be due to a pre-arranged agreement on who will carry what traffic, or based on some financial agreement.  You may want to route some traffic to one neighbor, but different traffic to another.
The main advantage of BGP is that it gives you much more control over what routes you advertise and what advertisements you accept from your neighbors.  BGP gives you more control over route selection and your neighbor's route selection.  That's one of the major reasons BGP is The Routing Protocol for the Internet.
For example, in packet tracer I can have a single autonomous system running EIGRP, but I can simply just use a static route to connect that autonomous system to the local ISP routers that are running OSPF.
I remember reading that BGP is needed for communication between autonomous systems, but is this always true?
