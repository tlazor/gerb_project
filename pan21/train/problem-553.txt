I narrowed the problem to IIS7, so I added a method to the Application_Start event (it's an ASP.Net MVC app), which emails me every time the application is started and re-deployed the site about a week ago.  I've been getting the 'startup' email every 26ish hours since.
While it doesn't seem to have an immediate answer to your question it does appear that this is not an uncommon problem.
I discovered this by selecting the pool from the list of Application Pools and clicking the 'Recycling...' button.  That screen gives you a 3 options for recycle intervals: a set time interval (minutes), a fixed number of requests, or at specific times.  And it appears that you can use all 3 in concert.  You also have 2 options for Memory thresholds, that once hit will cause a recycle: Virtual memory usage (in KB) or Private memory usage (in KB).
Every 26 hours? That sounds like an application pool that is automatically restarting for the purposes of freeing memory.
This is controlled by the recycling feature of the Application Pool the site resides in most likely. You can tweak this to recycling at set times or at longer intervals.
