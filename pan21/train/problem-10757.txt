A very fast google search found, for example, RadioLabs WiFi Networking which contains several solutions of differing types, among which the GS-1000 seems to do what you ask (I have no experience with it) on up to 5 miles line of sight,
There's an interesting article, Long Range Links Explained, that contains some useful info about how to get a signal across a few kilometers using antennas, and recommends some suitable hardware.
If you've got a computer between it you could try out ICS (on windows) or the linux equivalent. You could possibly get another router with both wireless and ethernet ports, install DD-WRT on it and setup wireless bridging. 
A linksys router flashed with DD-WRT and setup as a Wireless Bridge will do the trick.  Assuming, you can receive the signal from wireless network in Building A from Building B.  It'll use the wireless link to create a bridge between Building A and Building B allowing wired-ethernet connected clients in Building B to see all clients (wired and wireless) in Building A.
Many other companies manufacture such hardware, and I have even heard of a case where the problem was solved using a tin-can as antenna.
i use one and have no problems with it.  this device should allow you to connect a switch to its port and then connect all the devices you need to the switch.  I haven't tested this but it doesn't appear to do anything odd that would prevent it.  My friend bought a similar device which called itself a "Game adapter".  It did odd things with the mac address of the device connected so it only supported a single device.
