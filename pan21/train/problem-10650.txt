However I would not suggest to do this unless you can obtain permission from the relevant persons as this will likely be a breach of some form of policy or contract that could land you in trouble.
While you can set up a second DHCP server on a network, there is no reliable way to get a computer to prefer its responses.
You could set up a router with it's WAN interface plugged into your company lan, then operate a different subnet under your control so you can control DHCP for your machines without affecting the rest of the company's LAN while still accessing the company's resources.
More importantly, though, you should not be trying to circumvent your company's policy.  This is unprofessional.  If you need access to the DHCP server, make a case for it to your manager.
You shouldn't be creating your own DHCP service at all without the permission of the network and system administrators, in fact doing so without their permission should be a firing offence. It's exactly this kind of behaviour which underlines why DHCP in anything but a client-only environment is dangerous.
Recently I want to setup PXE boot server (i.e. DHCP server + TFTP server + syslinux software) for my company network in a LAN. I have read the setup details at here: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9963
If I cannot setup my own DHCP server, what is the working round for this problem? I really want the PXE boot to easy my batch installation process. thanks. 
I want to do the PXE boot in a good intention (make the new OS installation easier). Can I setup my own DHCP server (not 'legal' DHCP server) and use it with my PXE server to do the PXE boot? Is it possible? 
However I don't have admin/access right to the existing DHCP server and I cannot change the settings. (you need to put the PXE server IP address in the DHCP server configuration file to make the PXE booting works).
