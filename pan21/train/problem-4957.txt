I did a little research and it looks like the thermals are really bad on this laptop. There are a lot of people complaining about the same issues and the reason why your fans are picking up is because the thermals are high. Here is a forum of people talking about similar issues, one person replaced the thermal paste and got better thermals. Wouldn't be a bad idea to try new thermal paste or get your IT department to do it, if you have one.
Edit: If it is the thermals in why the fan is picking up, you do not want to lower or turn off the fans, even though there is software you can download to do this with.
Is there a setting in Windows 10 or the BIOS that tells the CPU to throttle enough down that the fans will not kick in?

I have been assigned a Lenovo T480 machine with Windows 10.  Unfortunately something (probably the anti-virus software which has plenty to do as I do Java development) uses so much CPU that the fans speed up occasionally.
