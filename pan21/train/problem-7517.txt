These devices are simply looking for available networks, not trying to associate with them.  This is normal behavior for a device looking for networks and to determine what the AP capabilities are.  
All APs also advertise themselves with beacon frames periodically, which is the other way that clients can find wireless networks in the area. However this is a slower process for discovery, so the vast majority of clients use probe request/responses primarily for discovery.
You have likely experienced this yourself without realizing it. When you want to join a wireless device to a network, you have likely been presented with a list of wireless networks and selected the one you wanted to join. This list was generated largely from the probe responses the wireless client received from APs in the area when it sent out probe requests.
When an access point hears a probe request, if the probe request is either general in nature or for the configured wireless network, it responds with a probe response. This behavior is defined by the IEEE standards for 802.11 networks. So your AP will always respond to any general probe request from a wireless client.
They are simply checking the availability of wireless networks around them. This does not necessarily indicate they actually want to join or associate to the network.
When a wireless client is looking to join a wireless network (or check for the possibility of roaming to a new one), they send out probe requests. Often these are general in nature and how a device discovers which networks are around them. Think of it as the client device yelling, "Can any wireless networks hear me?"
Probe requests can also be directed to particular networks. "Can network ABCXYZ hear me?" This is required with the SSID is "hidden" and is the default way many mobile devices try to reconnect to stored networks.
