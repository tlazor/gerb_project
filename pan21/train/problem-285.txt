The sad truth: This isn't currently possible.  There is some work being done to support EFI in Syslinux, but my impression that it is far from complete. 
Even tough it would be more or less trivial to implement such a thing with the uEFI framework there are only toy uEFI applications which will boot a kernel image via http or tftp out there.
Also most uEFI machines only have a BIOS-like text mode UI, so no graphical stuff there - but I'd expect some to appear soon as the uEFI adaptation has now progressed into mainstream desktop/laptop machinery. 
Looks like you can even reuse most of you already existing system by just swapping out the bootloader image.
I don't think there is a specific piece of software that accomplishes this.  Here's an article that might help you out: PXE Magic: Flexible Network Booting with Menus
From my understandings of the standards, PXE doesn't really care if there's an EFI or plain old BIOS underlying.
You (may) just need to make sure that the image you're loading over the network is compatible with EFI. GRUB2 is EFI-ready, can't confirm it for SYSLINUX, as the site is currently down (I do know however, that it was worked on).
