Worst of all, you're taking that huge risk just so you can block their IP address; why not just automatically block all bruteforcing addresses and save yourself the honeypot risk? Besides that, IP addresses are easy to come by, and maintaining a list of supposedly 'bad' ones will become an exercise either in futility or in mapping the IPv4 address space.
When they figure out how to bypass your little script, maybe by using SFTP (which doesn't execute .bashrc) to replace .bashrc so they can log in interactively, they've now got local access to the box, which means that unless you're extremely vigilant about regular patching, they've probably got a quick path to root via local exploit - and even if you are vigilant, they only have to wait until a new local vuln is disclosed that hasn't been patched yet.
The reason it feels dangerous is because it's dangerous. You're going to give somebody you know is trying to compromise your system a foothold into that system just so you can block their extremely replaceable IP address?
