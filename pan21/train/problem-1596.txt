We have a Windows 2003 Server that crashes relatively regularly (about once every week). At the time the server crashes, there isn't any information in the event logs. Not in Application, not in Security, and not in System. The monitoring system (Nagios) does not report any abnormal conditions on the machine near the time of crash. And when I say crash I mean the server turns off, not merely a blue screen.
If there is no blue screen, the OS wasn't in control when the server went down.  I would think that means you won't find any logs either.  To me it sounds like a hardware issue, maybe heat or power related?
I have made some guesses about the cause of the crashes, but so far nothing has proved to be correct. Does anyone know where I can find further information (e.g. logs) or provide any helpful guesses as to the cause?
I've also encountered sites where the power lines themselves into the server closet were poor, causing the UPS devices to kick in every few minutes due to voltage drops or spikes.
At a former job site, the building would test the backup generators regularly, which might cause systems to power off if not hooked into a working UPS. Granted, the building management did tell everyone that this was a standard policy.
