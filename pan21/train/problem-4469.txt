I noticed that a Schema has been created in the USERS Tablespace but our local rule is that it should be in a Tablespace by itself. In Oracle how do you move a Schema to a different Tablespace?
I tried many scripts but didn't worked for all objects. You can't move clustered objects from one tablespace to another, for that you will have to use expdp. So I will suggest expdp is the best option to move all objects to different tablesapce.
nohup expdp \"/ as sysdba\" DIRECTORY=test_dir DUMPFILE=users.dmp LOGFILE=users.log TABLESPACES=USERS &
A schema itself can not be stored nor can have changed tablespace en bloc in any way. In fact, it is just a meta-structucre. Instead - there is DEFAULT TABLESPACE attribute of underlying USER. If you change it, then new objects are created in this tablespace by default (unless you excplicitly specify another one).
In addition, each type of structure (Table/Index/Partition...) has it's own way of moving to another tablespace. (i.e. moving a table does not move indexes built upon it - which would be rather undesirable, because you want to store indexes in another filesystem for better performance). This means, that you will have to move contents of the schema object by object.
