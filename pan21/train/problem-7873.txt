sometimes we create additional users and allow them access to specific database and drop users after testing, troubleshooting is completed as it do not allow access to instance level but just to database level. 
Allowing access is a tricky and well planned strategy. Ultimately DBA's are responsible to allow access and maintaining of databases and mainly in STG and PRODUCTION environment. You do not want to allow any unnecessary access into STG and PROD environment because ultimately you DBA's will be responsible for any changes. 
and coming back to question: No one should be allowed access in PROD. As @John M mentioned we use policy of restoring Databases to DEV and UAT environment. Developers and other related departments have access to that environment as they are needed. We allow then further access as per ticketing and remove access after troubleshooting is completed or if it is permanent than again get proper approval. 
First of all if you allow access to STG or PROD to make you receive proper authentication from your manager or requesting person in written.
