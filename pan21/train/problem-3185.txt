The point is that every $L$ that is (extensionally) in $P$ admits a description that is extremely straightforward, because $P$ is a so-called "syntactic" complexity class.  Namely, just take a polynomially clocked Turing machine, that terminates in exactly the amount of time desired.  Any "reasonable" system for doing mathematics, such as PA or ZFC, is going to be able to prove that $L\in P$ if you use this straightforward description of $L$.
Assuming ZFC is consistent, the above formula defines the set of even integers, but ZFC doesn't know it.  With a bit more tinkering, we can easily get a description of the set of even integers that ZFC won't be able to prove is in $P$.
The upshot is that if you're hoping that the reason it's hard to prove that $P\ne NP$ is that there are languages in $P$ that are "too complicated" for us to reason about, then I think you're barking up the wrong tree.  Extensionally, every language in $P$ is in $P$ for trivial reasons.  You can muddy the waters by playing around with impossibly opaque descriptions of languages in $P$, but this is a general trick that has nothing to do with $P$ in particular, so I don't think it yields much insight.
To understand the difficulties with your question, I think you must first appreciate that there's a fundamental difference between intensional and extensional definitions of a language $L$.  Extensionally, $L$ is determined by what words are or are not members of $L$.  That is, two languages $L$ and $L'$ are extensionally equal if and only if they contain exactly the same words as members.  In contrast, an intensional definition of $L$ describes some conditions for a word to be in $L$.  A Turing machine that accepts $L$, or a first-order formula $\phi(x)$ that holds if and only if $x\in L$, can be thought of as an intensional definition of $L$.
I think that there is a fundamental underlying difficulty with the question you are asking here (and that you asked in your related question about incomprehensible languages).
So if you want to confuse ZFC, you're going to have to come up with some (intensional) description of $L$ that is "too complicated" for ZFC to recognize as being equivalent to the straightforward description of $L$.  This is possible, but in some sense it's too easy to be interesting.  All you have to do is to take something that we know that ZFC doesn't understand (e.g., its own consistency) and mix it up with the definition of $L$ somehow.  For example, here's a description of a set of integers:
