But if you have a Wi-Fi client device whose RF design is so crappy that it really only works well at one end of the band (channels 10 and 11), then I'd throw out that POS and buy something that doesn't suck.
If you have a European (ETSI) model of Wi-Fi AP that supports channels 1-13, and some US (FCC) Wi-Fi client devices that only support channels 1-11, I could understand manually setting your AP to any channel from 1 to 11 (but not 12 or 13) so your FCC devices would be sure to join.
Also, to be a good neighbor, if your Belkin Wi-Fi router supports 802.11n, make sure you're not using "wide" (40MHz, HT40) channels in the 2.4GHz band.  Use only traditional 20MHz (HT20) channels in 2.4GHz, to leave room for Bluetooth and your neighbors' networks and the like.
Try manually setting your AP to channel 1, then seeing how all your devices do.  Then try manually setting it to channel 6 and see how all your devices do.  Hopefully between channels 1, 6, and 11, you'll find a channel that all your devices can do fine on.
