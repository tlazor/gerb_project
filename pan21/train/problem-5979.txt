For anyone that had issue with this after upgrading to Windows 10 Creators, specifically with Vagrant using VirtualBox, I was able to upgrade to 5.1.24 and get Vagrant also working again.
For my Vagrant set up this fixed the problem.  Don't know if there are other issues with Vagrant for others like in the answer from Jake B, but follow the answer above from there if 5.1.24 doesn't work for you.
Similar for me. Upgrading to Windows Creator Fall (1709). Virtual Box starts but the screen stays black. Turning off 3D graphics acceleration helped to go on with my work. We had something similar in the past. It was fixed by a point release by VirtualBox.
When I opened the window for creating a new virtual machine, I noticed that VirualBox wasn't able to create 64-bit guest OS:es anymore. I then disabled Hyper-V according to Why does virtualbox only have 32-bit option, no 64-bit option on Windows 7?. This made VirtualBox able to create new 64-bit VM:s and start my existing VM:s.
For anyone that had issue with this after upgrading to Windows 10 Creators, specifically with Vagrant using VirtualBox, I was able to upgrade to 5.0.38 to fix this issue (rather than 5.1.x, which breaks some things with my Vagrant setup).
