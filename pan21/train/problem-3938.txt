Please understand that even if the Server RAM does fit, boot, and runs your desktop you might not be getting what you bargained for.
I will give you a link to a YouTube video that answers your question (with ram, cpus, hard drives, etc);
Wow I didn't expect there to be such a lack of clarity in the various answers and comments. Here's a definitive answer:
So to be clear, the very best you can do for your PC is two sticks of 2GB DDR2 Non-ECC RAM. Because you were looking at Kingston yourself, I'm happy to point you here:
I don't know if the RAM will work on your Desktop (nor do I care to find out) I do know that it wouldn't be what you expected.
You'll still find them. They're rated max 800MHz, but your PC will run them at 400/533/667 depending on what it's capable of.
I've seen mixed results in my time. Some non-ECC capable motherboards will handle ECC RAM fine and others not.
With seeing how old your MOBO is, you would be better off (a lot better off) just getting the desktop ram (you would save a bit of money too).
