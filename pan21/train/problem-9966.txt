Database performance is almost entirely related to the amount of data that gets moved around, how much space you have to move it around in, and how fast that space is.... (memory being the fastest space)
As for the JavaScript handling, it has issues too, it is processing values which have no need for processing, and it is introducing bugs too. You should probably inspect the metadata of the query, and identify fields that need processing, instead of checking each and every value. In other words, if the query was select name, id from users your code is checking every name, and every ID, and there could be many of them. Instead, you should check the name column, and identify it as String results, then check the ID column, and identify it as numberic. Then, you should only process values in the name fields, and not even check values in the ID.
The bottom line, is that you should only be storing significant data. It makes everything faster, smaller, and more efficient.
What you are doing is the worst of the options.... handling the trim in the client, after all the hard work is being done by the network, database, and now the browser. Doing it right the first time would remove the need for anything to 'suffer'.
A second option is to trim the values on the database side before returning them to the client.... adding rtrim() to your SQL will remove the need for any handling on the client side.
Finally, what if white-space is important. What if the value in the table is... padded numbers, for example, or... a formatted field, like
