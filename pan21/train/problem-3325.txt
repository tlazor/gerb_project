So in the end if you can regularly clean the fan, then in my opinion there is no great cause of concern.  If you can't regularly clean the fan, then having it running continuously will decrease its lifetime. Unfortunately, I'm unable to estimate by how much will the lifetime be decreased, so I don't know if it will make an impact on the lifetime of the whole computer.
If the fan and heatsinks are regularly cleaned, the impact from dust will be much smaller and fan will have longer lifetime.
So having fan on all the time will decrease its lifetime. How big impact there will be on fan's lifetime depends on conditions in which it operates. Fans usually die because dust gets into their bearings and damages them. After that fan will slow down and start emitting grinding noises. This will reduce airflow causing even more dust to accumulate and increase of the  temperature. As temperature increases, dust will start to bake. At one point it will into into black solid substance and grinding noise will become even louder and fan speed will decrease even more causing temperature to increase. Sometime after this step, serious overheating problems will appear and computer will start to shutdown. At one point fan will fail and will have to be replaced.
