Technically, there's no difference between a private and a public IP address. It's quite possible that your DNS provider won't accept private IP DNS entries though.
If you run your own authoritative DNS server (pointed to from outside) it's quite possible to have some A record resolve to a private IP address. If you don't like that you need to either be careful, split the DNS scope or use a filter between inside and outside queries.
The machinery of some organisation's public DNS server might give you an answer, but it would be its answer not yours.  
However, the policy about private addresses says that such addresses should not be leak out from their organisations.
You're quite right, no other organisation can magically see into your network and find, for example, host names unless you have some way to publish them.
But specifically regarding 192.168.0.0/16 type addresses: as private IP addresses are not uniquely assigned, any organisation can use them and assign its own names to them.
