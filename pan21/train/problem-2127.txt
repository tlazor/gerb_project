In the case of PCs, which in the environments I've worked in are not always in the office or on the network, the image disc (normally a DVD) is attached to the inside of the case. This allows me to easily walk the user through a restoration even when either of us is off-site.
WDS comes to mind, as it is free with Windows Server and is pretty painless to configure. It will allow you to create a custom image with software pre-installed. You can also make a stand-alone solution with Windows PE and unattended answer files created with WAIK.
For laptops one copy goes to the user and one gets filed away. I find that in the case of laptops I find that the amount of work involved in removing all the crap that comes preinstalled and actually is something I don't wish to repeat. Once the machine is in a state I consider ready to use I take a new image and hide the original discs, so that the user can't use them.
In addition to the various server based installation/distribution methods already mentioned, which should be your first line of attack when appropriate, there is also the concept of making images of the machines on disc. It isn't always the perfect solution but when it applies it has some advantages.
If you are using individual OS and software licenses though, you may be stuck, as most of these methods depend on the fact that you are using volume licensing and have the same product key for everything. This is because the custom image is captured with these keys in place, so activation may fail if you don't use MAKs.
