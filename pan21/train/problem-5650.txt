My mouse is stuck in "drag" mode. This generally happens in Photoshop, but happens dragging files and such as well.
Have you checked if this is caused by Mouse Keys? This didn't solve this issue for me, but it worked for the poster there.
A quick Finder search turned up a proper uninstall script for AirDisplay and the problem was gone. The above article outlines a number of other possible solutions as well. 
I was pretty sure Air Display (an iOS screen sharing app) was the culprit so I tried uninstalling it with AppCleaner, but the problem remained. However, this SwitchingtoMac ad confirmed my suspicion: 
I experienced this problem and dealt with it for a month or two by putting the machine to sleep every time I noticed it. This is only a temporary fix, however, as the problem returns on a restart. Not usually a problem, but makes apps like Photoshop neigh unusable!
For example, right now, my mouse moves but can not click anything so I am using the keyboard to navigate this site.
Clicking rapidly here and there generally solves the problem. Sometimes though, it won't go away until a restart. Unplugging devices, etc., doesn't do anything.
