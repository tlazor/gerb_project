I would say that in the modern world most computers are not 100% internal.  Most desktops can make some limited connections to the outside world or vice versa.
My corporation will probably never switch to IPv6 internally. It would require a fundamental shift in policy so massive I can't honestly conceive how it could come about. A lot of people would have to get killed, and a lot of inexplicable hiring choices would have to be made. Likewise, any attempt by individual business units to switch to IPv6 on their LANs would be squashed with prejudice by the corporate networking overlords based on interoperability and maintainablity concerns (we allow a lot of leeway locally, but not that much.)
The only good reason to go IPv6 internally is to be ready when the world switches to IPv6, and I think that's a pretty bad reason, given the rate of adoption. Since most internal IPs won't be externally reachable, it wouldn't be a big deal to translate the rest.
IPv4 was intended that every device be directly on the Internet...until we ran out of address space. Then, we've spent the last 20 years locking it all down. Now, IPv6 by design wants to, once again, place every device directly on the Internet... the outcome will be the same.  I totally agree that NAT is one layer of security that is not going to be abandoned without an equally effective, or better, replacement.
Chris S concepts on NAT are way wrong; one of the best features of NAT besides the artificial expansion of IPv4 schema is SECURITY. NAT is the layer that hides the real IP of a host that if directly connected to Internet can be the target of all the imaginable attacks. Happily talking about getting rid of NAT without encouraging extra security measures is just plain ignorance on the topic.
