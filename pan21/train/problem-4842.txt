What would be the best way to go about creating a public folder and converting/forwarding/moving/(whatever) over the current email address to that folder?
Currently we use a distribution group called Orders that has an email address that is that forwarded to four people in the company, the same goes for another one, Quotes. The problem is, of course, no one knows what was answered, and all the email gets worked in to the individual user's emails, so I'm thinking that a public folder, only accessible by one department would be the answer. 
Considering Microsoft direction, I'd steer clear of Public Folders. What we do instead is to create a Shared Mailbox with the 'quotes@' email address, grant a group of people Full Access to that mailbox, and guide them in configuring Outlook to open that mailbox for their use. It works well, and has replaced many Public Folders we had been using. 
I'm not sure what the best way to set this up would be or how to move/convert the current distribution list over to a public folder.  This is a very critical email address in the company, so I'm trying to be sure that there is zero down time at all for it.
