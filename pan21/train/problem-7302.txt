If you would like to learn more about linux then i would advise a linux web server is the way to go. It very reliable and once up and running you should never have any problems again. Only problems i have had with my linux web server is i upgraded some of the software and some how Apache lost the configuration so it did not load all the correct mods. But other then that indecent i have had no problems with it. If you want to be double secure i would advise dumping your database to SQL files and then using a service like Amazon S3(simple storage service) sync all your data to there servers its fairly cheap even for huge amounts of data.
i would advise getting a vps or if you willing to spend money getting a dedicated server i can suggest: http://english.keyweb.de/dedicated/index.shtml and if you are german http://www.keyweb.de/keyweb.shtml
They are a very reliable provider i have tested there VPS solutions and very happy with the service I received. If you are only familiar with Windows and dont want to learn linux then you can get a windows server from them and install php by going through some tutorials.
if your question is more specific to howto get a webserver up and running i will happily point you in the right direction.
