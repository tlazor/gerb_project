Due to some some other constraints, I wasn't able to get inspection disabled on our ASA, so I had to make some compromises.  Here's what I observed/learned:
So my lame workaround was using two separate sites:  one that used a masquerade IP and required SSL, the other site that didn't.
the TL/DR version:  If your FTP server allows you to specify a masquerade IP & a range of ports used for PASV connections, you SHOULD be able to fix this by opening up those ports & disabling ftp inspection.
In my case, we're running IIS 7.5 behind a slightly older version of ASA, which we're in the process of replacing.  We have an existing FTP site and my plan was to simply add FTPS support with the certificate & maybe getting our network admins to open up a few ports.  IIS has a similar masquerade setting for each FTP site named "External IP Address of Firewall", which is, itself, misleading.
So in our case, when I set the masquerade IP, I was able to connect just fine via FTPS, but regular FTP would fail.  When I removed the masquerade IP, I was still able to connect to both FTP and FTPS using CuteFTP, but our primary client wasn't able to connect to FTPS.  (their system wasn't "smart" enough to translate the non-routable IP...)
