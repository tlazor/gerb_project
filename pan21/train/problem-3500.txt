Mail server (postfix, etc ...) flushes a file with fsync() to assure the file was indeed written. Count of writes and fsyncs per mail is at least two (without spam checkers and anti viruses), so you need a file system which performs best in this scenario.
But as mention by others: testing is in order, the same FS can behave quite differently on different hardware and as I said in the beginning it has been a while since I setup that server.... (I guess about 4 years) and the available FS and also their performance might have changed quite a bit.
I used XFS for a mail server setup (has been ext3 before) and definitely noticed an improvement with all the small files but it has been a while back and IIRC there are/were some "issues" with XFS and power-cuts (or any abrupt disruption to disk access for that matter) leaving all opened files filled with "0" and similar.
The last time I was checking out tests and testing myself XFS still beat the crap out of the other competing file systems.
The first one enables it for all future directories.  The second one crawls through all your existing directories and builds the hash trees.  That may take a good long while, so plan for some downtime.
