Try placing a script named .xinitrc in your home directory. KDE and Gnome also have the ability to run scripts/applications on login if you're using one of those. I believe .Xstartup or .xstartup might also do what you want if .xinitrc doesn't. My linux is getting a bit rusty it seems. >.>
The XDG Autostart Specification works for any XDG-compliant desktop environment, including Gnome, KDE, XFCE, and others.
the other possible solution is to find out how the different desktop environments / windowmanagers support the concept of "autostart". i personally avoid these mechanisms and stick to the good old .xinitrc / .xsession way.
you will learn, that, depending on how you bring up the xserver, 2 scripts are used for starting things after the xserver came up:
.xinitrc is the one to use if you start your window manager from there. If you use KDE or GNOME you will need to add the program to the services that autostart on login.
depending on what you use to log into your system (and i think it is either gdm or kdm these days), things get a bit different. normally gdm and kdm (and other display managers as well) offer the user to select the "user session" or something similar labeled. if you pick this "user-session" then mostly these display managers will launch ~/.xsession. you would be responsible for bringing up your applications AND the desktop environment / windowmanager.
