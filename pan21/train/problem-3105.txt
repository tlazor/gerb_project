Simply mount the system disk in the rack and swap at necessity. Since these things are cheap, you should consider buying two twin racks, because every model requires you to mount the disk in its unique enclosure that can be extracted at any time. So if you have a single rack and two enclosures you can swap disks at any time. Obviously be aware that if there are any other disks mounted on your desktop the OS has full access (super user principle) to all of them.
Don't put your Windows partition into /etc/fstab and format your Linux partitions with a file format Windows can't read (any extN will do). That should take care of the most common things that could go wrong.  
To run Windows in a way that it cannot access Linux partitions even after being infected by the worst malware ever, an alternate would be virtualizing, but obviously you won't get direct access to video card and gaming performance.
While some disabling in the bios might hide the disks from the OS (this was possible on old ATA controllers but i doubt this is possible on SATA).
After upvoting kotekzot's answer and jet's comment here is the ultimate solution: buy a plain-old front-rack. Sorry, since shopping recommendations are forbidden I won't suggest you a specific brand.
if you have easy physical access to the hardware, unplugging the data cables from the HDDs you don't wish to be accessible would be the simplest and most reliable solution. I am not aware of any virtualisation products that would suit your needs, and disabling a drive in the bootloader doesn't guarantee it will be unavailable to the OS. You could try disabling them in BIOS, but again, no guarantees it will stick.
the kernel will always have raw access to the disk controllers and so to the disks.  And so be able to damage the other OS by destroying partitions.
If something on either installation is able to accidentally mess with your partition data, then you're using your system incorrectly.
