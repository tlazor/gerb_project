First of all, it looks to me like if you are polling the pin, rather than reacting to an event. This means that you will miss things that don't occur in the exact moment you are checking the pin. You want to have a look at the edge detection methods and procedures in https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Inputs/ Arguably, the most elegant way to do this would probably be to use the add_event_detect callback framework, but that might require some synchronization of your other variables.
The IR sensor can "see" things that you can't. It can detect movement that is invisible to the human eye. If there is anything rotating that casts a reflection of heat into the sensor, the sensor will probably interpret that as movement. Check the environment and check it again. If possible, bring up a representation of what the IR sensor "sees" onto a screen. If your sensor can't do that, consider using a Pi NoIR camera. If you like, you can actually implement the sensor using the camera.
It would be valuable to know if what the settings of the PIR sensor are, how the jumper is set, and how it is wired to the pi. Whithout knowing this I can only speculate that if the x and y you mention in the post are both in the range of 5s to 300s, and the jumper is set to H-mode, the "same" movement is causing the retriggering you are referring to.
This may sound really stupid, but I too was having the same issue, and it turned out that I had my ground and voltage wires reversed. As soon as I switched those wires, it worked! Double check the wiring.
