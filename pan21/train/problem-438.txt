If your IR transmitter is high level like an usb device you probably can use LIRC to interface with it, but it may be more interesting to use a (much cheaper) low level transmitter/sender and program it directly. You should be able to find easy howtos on different pi instructable sites, often with a ready made python module to control the GPIO pins.
I want to create something to replace my television remote.  I'm hoping to create a simple GUI that I can fiddle with on a touch screen.  I'm not sure if this project is right for the Raspberry Pi or on the Android platform. Anyone have any experience with this?
For the GUI you can either use some X11 toolkit or some nice graphics library for the framebuffer drawing a fancy interface yourself.
It is a feasible project for the pi, but not for the android platform. If you want to use android, get a mobile phone with IR transmitter and a corresponding app and you're done. But its kind of boring then. Interfacing with an IR transmitter directly on android will be much more complicated than when using a normal linux distribution and a nice library for your IR hardware.
For the pi you should get raspbian (or any other standard linux distribution) on it, an IR transmitter and possible a sensor (so you can record signals from the original remote control) and the touchscreen.
