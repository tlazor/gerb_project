As they can often support DPD mode (essentially sleep) and use system RAM only due to lower latency the battery life can go up.
High-speed drives (I have a Barracuda) take 8W on average (the documentation says). This means that you need to calculate it as 10W (2W as reserve power).
If you start looking at all the appliances around the house, read their electrical specs, then plug them into a power meter and read their actual usage..  it's much lower than what's on the label.  Very illuminating.
But according to the documentation, they can take 30W (plus 1-2W for the digital part) at spin up! When I did the power calculations for my PC, I considered two drives at 30W.
I measured the power consumption of my PC but it was some years ago and I forgot the numbers. I will do it again during gaming and boot.
21.36 watts sounds about right. You can use a general rule of thumb for about ~25 watts per 7200 rpm drive.
I've tested this experimentally and got maybe a 20% increase with identical system running 10 with Crucial M300 SSD versus 500GB slim 5400 HDD.
Its possible to accurately measure this with a tool like "Battmon" or similar and you can actually see the energy usage with things like screen brightness.
