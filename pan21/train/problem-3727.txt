There is also the Query Block List but this likely only works on recursive lookups and does nothing for the fake requests for NXDomains on authoritative dns servers as I wrote those blocks and the queries still come.
Basically as the title says I would like to be able to lockdown the internet through DNS settings on Windows Server 2008 R2 - preferably I would lock down everything and then just have a 'whitelist' of certain ip addresses / domain names - is this possible?
It can be done via the router, but I think due to the number of users we have on our network (50+) it struggled with the workload, so any help with getting the server to do the legwork rather than the router would be much appeciated, thanks.

The main reason one might want this is the BS fake UDP packets hitting MS dns servers around the world, so response rate limiting would help also, but again only available on 2016 (even though Bind has had it for years and years)
The best way I have found to combat this is #1 Make sure recursives are disabled, #2 return the NXDomain response making sure your dot zone (.) has no records including no name server records. This will return the smallest packet in response and the amplification part of the attack is mostly nullified.
That answer is not an answer and doesn't even address the question. The answer provided above is how to write a rule to block all access to a server or workstation by blocking the ip in the firewall and doesn't address the dns name at all, and therefore doesn't address the actual question.
My research has led me to thing that if you are running 2016 DNS you can do this with dns query policy but not any previous version.
