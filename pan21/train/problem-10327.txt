I am currently migrating an old file server I inherited which contains user data shares, there are numerous file shares configured with user home directories, for example:
For purposes of migration, I would like to keep the old and new file shares in sync, while I wait for folder redirection policies to apply and so forth. I initially tried this using DFS, but you can't have a many-to-one sync. I did think about configuring a DFS replication group for each folder share one by one but its not really practical, and causes issues with offline file sync because of the hidden files DFS places within the root of the folder its synchronising that the user doesn't have permissions for.
I investigate DSynchronize (dimio.altervista.org/eng/) which appears to be able to do "realtime sync" but I have to manually enter the folder paths one by one (there are a 250 user folders) so that's not really pratical either.
I wrote a powershell script to use robocopy on a list of folders I provide via a text file, but this isn't great as it just goes through in a loop, rather than doing any kind of intelligent sync of the folders like DFS would.
I am in the process of migrating away from this server into a DFS namespace, and all user shares will be kept under a single path, e.g.:
