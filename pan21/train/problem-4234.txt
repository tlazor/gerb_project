This is definitely a drivers problem. Please reinstall the ATKPackage (For Windows 10 Upgrade) for the Asus x55c 
Also, you might want to check all of the hotkeys that are in use on your system to make sure that an app hasn't hijacked some of your normal keys.
NirSoft has a no-install utility that will show you all hotkeys that are registered on your computer:
I bet it is shorting the signals for some function keys (like play, pause, volume, etc) when you press those keys. Which BIOS and windows7 in safemode might ignore so they end up processing the lower ones.
If you have access to linux, try to run the xev utility. I have no idea what is the equivalent on windows. It will show you the keycodes arriving from the keyboard. I bet it will show weird values together with those keys you mention.
First make sure you keyboard layout is set to EN-US, this can be done from Control Panel. It's also possible that you've enabled NumLock feature accidentally, try to press Fn + NumLk keyboard shortcut to turn it off.
To see if it is a hardware keyboard issue, you should go to the [Start] menu, page down to the [Windows ease of access] item, launch the [On-screen keyboard] and see if it has the same issues that your physical keyboard does.
