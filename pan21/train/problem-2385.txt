In your use case, the switches would simply function as "range extenders", whether necessary or not. They don't interact with the data transmitted and the don't need to.
Then there is VLAN tagging (also called VLAN trunking, 802.1Q). It is specific to Ethernet (802.3) networks. It specifies an additional header inside an Ethernet frame that contains a number, the so-called VLAN ID. This way, up to 4094 virtual "cables" can run over a single Ethernet connection, hence trunking. Because the on-wire data structure is different from regular Ethernet frames, device/software cooperation is required. However, to a regular switch, it's an Ethernet frame like any other. It has its destination and source MAC addresses in the usual places.
Usually, every port on a switch can communicate with all other ports. On virtually all managed switches, you can restrict this by putting the ports into groups that are isolated, effectively making one switch into two separate switches. This is called port-based VLAN. All this happens inside the switch and requires no cooperation from other devices.
First, what is VLAN? There are two things called VLAN. One is inside a switch. This is called port-based VLAN. There is also "VLAN on the wire", called VLAN tagging/trunking.
As long as the modem and the router on main floor are not further apart than 100 m (100 yards) you could use the only cable to directly connect modem and router. Your PC(s) would then be plugged in at the router.  
The two techniques can be combined: A port on a switch can be set to belong to multiple groups. To maintain isolation, the data is transmitted tagged.
There are indeed ISPs that use VLAN tagging, for example Deutsche Telekom with its "Entertain" IPTV service. Regular Internet access works via PPPoE on VLAN 7. IPTV is available via DHCP on VLAN 8. It relies on a provider-operated multicast network.
