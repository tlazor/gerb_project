Digikey paramateric search for 40 pin (2x20) 0.1" Pitch Male Pin Unshrouded headers has about 400 options with pin lengths from 2mm to 32mm
As mentioned in my previous post, I'm intending to solder some HATs directly to the Pi. However, I find the pins on the default header too short, so I need to replace them with longer ones.
These parts are available to order,  in nearly every size imaginable, from places that are happy to deliver anywhere in the world like Digikey, Mouser, and Newark. 
I have this Stackable Header from Adafruit with Extra Long pins, but the female part of the header gives it too much height so I would like to remove it. As is apparent from the image, the male headers are somehow attached to the female header and probably can be removed. Eventually, I want to end up with something like this which, unfortunately is unavailable where I live.
These are generic parts, sold by Adafruit as a hobby distributor. These parts are made and sold all over the world with  thousands of options. Keywords:
