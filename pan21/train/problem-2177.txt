Corsair F Series drives have a firmware problem that arises if you change system states. From another forum: "It runs fine as long as you don't try to put the laptop to sleep, wake it up, or change the hardware profile (say, by docking or undocking it)".  Allegedly there is a firmware update to 2.0 which may address it along with having the latest BIOS and having AHCI set (vs IDE) in your BIOS.  See http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=90759
Problem with SSD is that SSD self is the problem. Many SSD failures are in fact unrecoverable - because if the remapping tables get trashed - the media data is effectively randomized - and mixed up with blocks which were marked as corrupted and unusable even before the SSD failed.
This type of thing happens when the controller screws up somehow.  The flash memory itself is fine, most likely, as well as the data on it but you can't get to it without a functional controller.  Usually the only way to restore controller functionality is to re-flash the drive's firmware, which incidentally wipes out all your data.  This is why I tell everyone who uses an SSD to be extra sure you do backups.
Call the vendor for support and/or RMA, and stand by for a restore from backup.  (You do have a backup, right?)
A systemcrash rendered the partition on the harddrive useless. I rebooted and startet up Knoppix to investigate further. I wasn't able to find partitions.
What had happened was that (after being unable to find something he thought was useful) a trim command got issued and the "useless" data got purged.
SSD manufacturers need to come up with a way to re-flash a controller without causing it to wipe the drive clean.
