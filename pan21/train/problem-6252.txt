F7 will generally get you back to the GUI while 1-6 are generally virtual terminals. In addition, you may want to try re-creating your install media or downloading the ISO again as it's possible there are corruption issues. 
After some research i found out that this problem is caused by the selection of c ( untrackable english ) language in the installation process, i fixed everything from the settings, changing the language from c (untrackable english language) to english, and logging out and back in.
You can switch to the virtual terminals using CTRL-ALT-F# (like CTRL-ALT-F1). Once there, you can login and then use cat/head/tail/less to check log files in /var/log to look for errors/issues (or check using the GUI if other parts are working).
In addition, you could try opening gnome-terminal from inside the other terminal to see if any errors/issues are reported to stderr. Finally, try opening gnome-terminal as superuser/root. It's possible it's trying to access files with incorrect or restrictive permissions.
