Once the certificate exchange has taken place, normal VirtualHost rules will apply and you can actually host different content on each server name if that's what you desire to do.
Example: Two servers on the same IP using the wrong certificate (configured elsewhere) but still serving different content based on server name.
Example: Two servers on different IP addresses with different document roots, each presenting the correct certificate
What this means from a usability standpoint is that you can absolutely host both sites from the same apache host and IP but users will receive a warning when accepting the certificate telling them the certificate is for the wrong site. The only way around this would be to have two different IP addresses and configure your virtual hosts so that they each listen on a different address. (Make sure to update DNS accordingly)
As already explained, the SSL connection is created before any actual data is sent over the connection so Apache can not provide different SSL certificates for each of your virtual sites since it has no idea which server name is being requested. What this means is that regardless of what server name is actually requested (In this case "mysite.com" or "mysite.ca"), Apache will respond with the default SSL certificate it has been configured to use. This might be declared inside of the "default" 443 VirtualHost or in the global Apache configuration.
These examples are a little rough, you'll want to consult official apache documentation on the exact parameter names for setting up virtual hosts and configuring ssl if you don't know the basics already.
