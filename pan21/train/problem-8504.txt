If external power is supplied, a USBv3 hub can easily use the new full-duplex pipe for multiple legacy (v2, v1) half-duplex connections.
By default in Windows, it will connect USB drives in a "Disabled Write-Caching" mode, that means it will be safe to remove the hard-drive at almost any time. There is a way you can enable write-caching for the hard drive, which might help with performance, especially where there is a lot of small files:
Be careful with this though. If you don't "Safely Remove" hard drive with this mode on and you unplug it, you may well screw up the partition on the drive, and/or lose some or all data on it.
The problem is that USBv3, even though with a higher power spec, cannot suffice two (or more) USBv2 devices to optimum power. Without the required power, the devices might not work or might work in a low power mode, albeit with reduced speeds.
Open up Device Manager, find the Hard Drives category, and then figure out which of those devices is your USB hard drive(s). When you have discovered which one, right click on it, select Properties, and click on the Policies tab. There you will find the two modes of connection.
Is it possible to speed this up by using USB 3.0, ie connecting both drives to a USB 3.0 controller (like a USB 3.0 ExpressCard adapter)? 
I've noticed that transfers between USB 2.0 drives are usually very slow. From what I understand, this is because all USB 2.0 devices connected to the same USB 2.0-host share the same 480Mb/s of bandwidth.
