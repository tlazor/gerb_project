Like any virtualization setup, RAM is king, so if you want to do this regularly (and want to be able to do work on the host simultaneously), max out your RAM.
I have had no trouble with VMWare (Player / Server) versions in PC Box without virtualization support. I think VirtualBox runs ok, too.
Yes, it's possible.  The important feature to have is VT-x support.  Without this, virtualizing an OS like Windows XP will be slower, and you won't be able to use others, such as Snow Leopard, at all*.  VT-d is some kind of bonus extension to VT-x that will enable the virtualized OS to have direct access to hardware functions.
If you are running Linux in your host and are going to virtualize supported guests you should probably give Xen a try, it uses paravirtualization (a method of virtualization in which the guest runs a modified kernel) and has the best performance I know of without using any virtualization extensions.
I had to in a pinch run an XP VM on an Asus EEEPC (we're talking about an Intel Atom 270 with 1 GB DDR RAM here) that had Ubuntu Netmix on it; installed VirtualBox, XP ran fine.  It was understandably slow, cpu was running near 100%, and the fan was going non-stop, but it got the job done.
