You will need to go into your browser settings and change your homepage and disable any tabs that open after scans. 
Both of which are free, just be sure you don't check the "30 Day Pro-Trial" boxes and they shouldn't ever bother you to purchase them. 
I would highly recommend you run some virus scans in addition to Catatonic's advice. I recommend SuperAntiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/
P.S. While you are looking at your lift of installed addons check for one called privacy safeguard. As good as this sounds, that one addon has been quite a pain in my experience. 
1) work on another browser for a while. If you don't see the same windows/tabs opening, your problem is limited to chrome (which explains why your antivirus didn't pick anything up). 
A piece of adware could feasibly change these settings in your default browser that would persist even after the adware itself was removed.
2) check your chrome addons. There will probably be one that you don't remember installing or has a name with something to do with shopping or advertising. You will want to disable this addon. 
I've recently noticed that my browser (Google Chrome) occasionally opens two new tabs on its own seemingly randomly. The two tabs display the same page- supposedly offering some BT broadband 2015 special deal... It seems that I have somehow picked a virus/ some adware. I have run scans with McAfee Total Protection and Ad- Aware, but these don't seem to have picked it up. Does anyone have any recommendations for how to get rid of it?
Open the Chrome options menu (on the right) and go to Settings. Under the heading On Startup (near the top) I'm willing to bet that you Open a specific page or set of pages radio button is selected. There should be a Set Pages button next to this that will allow you to remove those pages from your startup list.
