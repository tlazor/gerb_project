your mobo supports only single channel mode. usually support for dual channel mode DIMM is not implied but clearly stated. the link you provided mentions single channel DDR2 1066 single channel model only
the above answers are not really on point or clear. of course it's going to run only in single channel because it has to do with the type of motherboard and processor so if single channel, using more memory sticks no matter if they are the same brand or size makes no difference.  the cpu will only recognize one and the other will be obsolete or redundant. worse, if one is slower than the other, it will choose that frequency.   only dual channel configurations of your system/processor/motherboard will make using more than one memory stick work. often people will put in two or more memory sticks in a single channel configuration and not realize it's doing nothing to add more speed.
Dual-channel gives you double the channels for your RAM to do their processing.  It makes your RAM even faster, even if it's by a small margin.  If I had the choice, I'd go Dual-Channel vs. Single Channel.
