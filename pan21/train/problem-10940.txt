That said, you have to realise you cannot just buy any old CPU, and any old motherboard, and hope they fit together - you must buy compatible components, which can be a pain to figure out what works with what. 
It may also be worth purchasing an anti-static wrist strap, and some thermal paste for your first PC build. (The strap to make sure you don't accidentally damage components, and the paste for when you insert your new CPU).
Aside from little things like power cords, you either need a video card or be sure your motherboard has a video output built-in.
Depending on what you need this computer for, you may need a DVD drive or a wireless network card (most motherboards have an Ethernet port but not wi-fi).
As you can see, there are a vast array of things to consider with regards to compatibility. Definitely find somebody who is knowledgeable about all of this to verify the parts you have chosen before spending cash on them.
Yes and no, it depends on purpose. Assuming "CPU Cabinet" means, well, the case, then yes that is all you will need to make a functioning system. Depending on your use case however, you may need some other optional extensions, such as a graphics card.
If you're doing this to save money - don't.  It's very difficult these days to build a computer from separately bought parts that's less expensive than the ones you can buy at a reputable computer store. I'd go so far as to say impossible if you're a beginner and if you value the time you're investing in the process. If you're doing this for fun and/or to build your experience level (so you can get a related job for instance), then go for it.  While there are many many people with a lot of experience on SU this isn't really the best place to get shopping advice.  It's supposed to be more oriented to solving specific problems.  But best of luck in any case.
