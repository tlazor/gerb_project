The problem I am having is setting up the database. Normally on a hosted site I just upload the mdf file and I get a connection string from them.
if you don't have SQL Express Installed on your VPS. You can download and install it from Microsoft Website. 
I tried attaching the mdf file that I created with VS2010 using Management Studio to the 'local' server on my virtual server.
Since the new database has a different schema, when you restore the database you will need to visit the Options tab and choose Overwrite the existing database.
Please create Database on Server. Backup local database and upload .bak file on server. Restore backup using SQL management studio. 
Unable to open the physical file "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\gtro\App_Data\ASPNETDB.MDF". Operating system error 5: "5(failed to retrieve text for this error. Reason: 15105)".
An attempt to attach an auto-named database for file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\gtro\App_Data\ASPNETDB.MDF failed. A database with the same name exists, or specified file cannot be opened, or it is located on UNC share.
