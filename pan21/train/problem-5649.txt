We use it primarily for domain controllers.  It helps to enforce the best practice that you shouldn't run any services on your DCs other than the AD services.
the only good thing about core is that it confused/scares the hell out of dumb admins!  Which is a good thing.
Microsoft has made great progress in improving their remote management tools suite over the years, but for some users, these tools can present a significant learning curve.  If you are still getting your feet wet with core installs, take a look at the Core Configurator which can expedite your deployment/configuration process.
The mistake I made is that server core is more suited for infrastructure servers, then it was made to be a modularized application specific server similar to what has been done with some of single purpose Linux distro's. 
We have been using/testing 2008 R2 Core for nearly a year now.  Our intention is to migrate the following services to Core installs prior to the end of the next K12 school year. 
For example, I thought server core would make a great build server for our code base, this turned out not to be the case. Perhaps this was more due to the dependencies of the code base.
Hopefully, in the future it will be extended to support hosting other services such as Sql Server, TFS, etc.
