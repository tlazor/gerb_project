If you can't run WifiDog on the access point itself, you can run the gateway software on a (Linux) machine that acts as router for the network. In fact the same machine can also run the authentication server part.
I am assuming that you want the access point to be open to anyone, but it blocked all traffic until the user tries to open a web page and is redirected to a login page that authenticates against AD or LDAP before allowing access to the network.
Try pfSense.  It is open source, and can run well on standard low-power PC hardware. The Captive Portal functionality is pretty much what you need around authentication.
Finally I've got a 30 days trial from PublicIP with ZoneCD and We'll definitly go for this solution. My boss is willing to pay the 175$ a year for the service after I showed and explain him what this solution can bring to us.
Also, basically any Access Point supported by dd-wrt can support WifiDog although you might have to cross-compile your own binary.
If so you may want to look into an Astaro gateway.  You can download an iso to install it on a test box and take a look at it.  I have used it on my home network to manage access to local resources from the wifi.  At home once you have connected to my open wifi you have no access to anything on the network, if you open a web page it redirects to the login page.  If you enter guest credentials you have full internet access, but no access to my NAS or other shares.  If you enter credentials that authenticate against a little LDAP instance I have running, you get access to local resources.  Otherwise the only thing you can access with the network it the login page.
