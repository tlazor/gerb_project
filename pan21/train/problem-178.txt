/edit : Mathieu makes the good point that you might do just fine with MS NLB, depending on the service(s) that you're trying to make highly available.
You badly defines your needs. You choose a solution based on what will the servers hosts (web sites, mailboxes, dns, databases, custom app...).
It may require special configuration on your switch, depend on setup your will choose (unicast vs multicast).
Mainly, the solution should be designed to work in high availability, else you will experience issue and won't be supported by the software vendor in case of issue or questions.
E.g., if 1 server goes down(due to connection or power, etc), the other kicks in either immediately, or after a certain time of like a few mins
I have 2 Windows Server 2012 servers, and 2 Windows Server 2008R2 servers. What software should I consider for each of the setup?
What are some of the industry standard enterprise software to allow fail-over or swap-over between 2 servers?
If you also need to share data (shared windows disk through san), then you must look on Windows Failover Clustering. It's more advanced (using resource) , but need a shared storage solution.
It's IP based, so it won't detect if your web server or application stop. It will spread load against all servers until one of them is disconnected from network or dead.
