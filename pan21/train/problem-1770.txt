Our old setup was just, single hosts with nginx as Reverse-Proxys and some magic to update the configs and request SSL certificates for new services.
Now let's say GoDaddy with a Domain like myswarm.com, this domain has to be set to one external IP, i would choose on of the Swarms VM's external IPs and it should work.
We are using docker since 1 1/2 Year with "single Host" Setups without trouble. But now we want to go further and use the Docker Swarm (latest version).
Also, the guidance should be helpful to deploy HA in Docker Swarm http://docs.master.dockerproject.org/swarm/multi-manager-setup/
If you are using Docker Machine, you can get the manager IP with either docker-machine ls or docker-machine ip <MACHINE-NAME> â€” for example, docker-machine ip manager1.
The IP address must be assigned to a network interface available to the host operating system. All nodes in the swarm must be able to access the manager at the IP address.
But what happens when the VM linked to the Domain goes down? How to handle this scenario with Docker? Or does i need 2 more VMs with HAProxy and some VIPs facing outside?
