OpenVPN setups should be treated like a router.  The address space used for the VPN clients should be a completely separate subnet from the network that you are routing.  You need to set up routes properly on all network devices so that the traffic for the VPN subnet is correctly directed to the VPN server.
The network you have setup for your VPN server server 10.202.46.0 255.255.255.0 is within the 10.202.0.0/16 subnet.  This means you are going to have a serious routing problem.
You mention the gateway for the 10.202.0.0/16 network is 10.202.1.1.  Do you mean that 10.202.1.1 actually has a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0?  If so, then your setup is extremely broken.
I'm trying to get an OpenVPN server working to give clients access to a network that is 10.202.0.0/16. I'd like the OpenVPN clients range to be 10.202.46.1-255. I have configured the server, and can connect to it fine. I'm using it to replace the default gateway of the client. However, for some reason the OpenVPN server is giving my client the address 10.202.46.6 and says my default gateway is 10.202.46.5. I can ping 10.202.46.1, but I can not ping anything else within the network. My server.conf file can be read at http://pastebin.com/jM3G5yhV. Anyone have any ideas why I can't ping anything else in the network? The gateway of the 10.202.0.0/16 network is 10.202.1.1.
Nothing in 10.202.0.0/16 will know how to reach hosts in the 10.202.46.0/24 network.  Hosts in 10.202.0.0/16 will be arping directly for the hosts instead of trying to contact the VPN server as a gateway.
Iptables will also push our routes for the networks you setup so it will send traffic over the tunnel. 
Did you configure push route section on openvpn server config? AFAIR you must push routes from server so that clients could know that they must send packets to openvpn network through openvpn network interface.
That is correct since openvpn gives you a small subnet to use. Try just enabling ip forwarding on your server and see if that helps
