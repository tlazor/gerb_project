It's also possible that your hybrid MBR is damaged or that you've got mis-matched GPT and MBR data. In this case, you'll need to repair your partition table. The details of what you'll need to do depend on what specific damage you've suffered, and your post doesn't provide sufficient details to reveal that. The gdisk documentation site includes a page on repairing GPT damage, which should help you get started. Posting detailed output of both the GPT and MBR data might help us understand what's going on. To do this, enter gdisk, type x to enter the experts' menu, type p, type o, and then type q to quit. Post the entire session output. If gdisk asks you whether to use GPT or MBR data when you first start it, then that means that they're badly mis-matched, and you need to decide which to use. Note that in this sort of situation, OS X is likely to use the GPT data and Windows will use the MBR data, so you'll need to carefully check both tables, figure out which is correct (or which portions of each is correct), and develop a plan to reconcile them.
Chances are you should be using a hybrid MBR with your setup. I don't know if Clonezilla deals well with that. If you need the hybrid MBR and Clonezilla doesn't like it, you could back up your hybrid MBR (in fact, your whole partition table) with gdisk, create a fresh protective MBR to replace the hybrid MBR, use Clonezilla, and then restore the hybrid MBR. This is a pretty advanced dance, though, so I recommend you do it only once you understand what you're doing. Read the gdisk documentation and anything else (maybe the Wikipedia article on GPT) until you understand it. (I haven't provided step-by-step details because I don't want to encourage anybody who doesn't understand it to try it.)
If you're lucky, the fix for your problem will be easy. Be careful, though, because it's possible that you're heading into very treacherous waters. If you have important data on that disk, back it up before you do anything else!!!!
