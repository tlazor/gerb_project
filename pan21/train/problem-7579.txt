I have configured exim4 to send e-mails using TLS through smtp.gmail.com::465 , NOT STARTTLS through smtp.gmail.com::587. I used information provided to me that was pulled from various sources. The complete list of steps I performed can be seen at https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server#configure-gmail-as-mta-with-implicit-tls.
When running exim -bP transport remote_smtp_smarthost, only the settings for the remote_smtp_smarthost transport are shown. Chances are you're not even using that transport. It's best to use exim -bP without parameters, that shows the main settings. Lynis probably needs to be improved a bit regarding this.
You can check whether exim is using TLS when sending emails to other mail servers by checking the exim mainlog. Look for lines with => which indicate deliveries. If there is a part of those lines that start with X=TLS1.2:... when exim is indeed using TLS, that part describes the TLS parameters used.
This is for a server at home, behind a router. I don't have a domain name so I created a local server-side certificate using /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/examples/exim-gencert.
I am able to send e-mails. I assume it is actually encrypted TLS traffic through 465 but I am not sure how to check. 
I went through Lynis' source and discovered it is checking for these to be set by checking for tls_certificate and tls_privatekey in the output of exim -bP transport remote_smtp_smarthost:
