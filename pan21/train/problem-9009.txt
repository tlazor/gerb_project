I'm not sure the encryption is the problem, but the error message seems to indicate that it is, so I am curious to see what the status is on the encryption and conversion status of your core storage partition, and if waiting for the decryption to finish/reformatting fixes the problem. Good luck!
which means the drive is being decrypted. If TimeMachine is not working because of the encryption then it should work again once that process is complete. If you have nothing on the drive and want to 'speed up' that process then you can reformat the drive as a normal HFS+ journaled partition, without the encryption turned on and then trying Time Machine then.
I've never tried backing up to an encrypted HFS+ drive myself, so I'm not sure what would happen if I did, but from the message you are getting it sounds like TimeMachine doesn't want to use the encrypted drive, and is trying to decrypt it, which takes time. It is possible that the drive is currently decrypting and TimeMachine should start working once that is done. I answered another question about that here.
