Speaking of Disk Utility, while you're in Command-R boot, repair your disk and repair your permissions.  It's possible that the permissions on your password storage file or the binary that sets passwords have gone funny and you don't have correct permissions to run-the-binary/save-the-new-password.
This will allow you to set a password outside your Mac environment.  While you're in the terminal, you'll want to clear your keychains, which often suffer with an offline password reset like this:  rm -R /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/[YourHomeFolderName]/Keychains/* and rm -R /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/[YourHomeFolderName]/Keychains/.*.  (Note, the Macintosh\ HD portion depends on your Mac set up to use that as the volume label; it may be different, but you can see it in Disk Utility.  The characters are, "Macintosh[backslash][space]HD".
Try booting to recovery with Command-R-boot.  When in recovery mode, you can run Utilities > Terminal.  Use the command resetpassword.
You may want to consider running something like applejack, which is a useful utility you install from a sourceforge downloaded package installer and run in single-user mode Command-S boot.  Applejack looks for corrupt .plist files, which is one possibility for your issues.
