i not want just one direction... i want the all possible directions where my enemy can shoot and that hit to the hero
as in picture the ball can bounce of the wall same as light bounce off wall, the indecent angle and refractive angle will be same(sorry image angles not perfect. i draw them in paint) so i know that slop of this path line will be same in whole path just interchange in negative and positive.
any algorithm and solution to archive this....i'm working in java so later i can port my game to android easily 
now i want to find the directions in which i can shoot like 2 coordinates of x,y or something where i can shoot and the ball reaches to the hero.
please edit if you found anything not properly asked ...i tried to make as simple as possible, but its my first time here.
I'm trying to make a 2D game where my Hero is standing in a 2D plan and surrounded by enemies(highest 3) that throwing balls. and my hero have a shield in hands and and will stop the balls...
