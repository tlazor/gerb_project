I'll first answer question (2). Let's solve the $(\max,+)$ product problem. The $(\min,+)$ product can be solved analogously by negating entries and adding $M$ to each entry to make all entries positive. 
The basic idea is to first figure out a way to extract the witness $k$ for entry $i,j$ provided $k$ is a unique witness for the minimum. Then one uses a carefully chosen, polylogarithmic number of random samples of columns of $A$/rows of $B$ which ensures that $k$ is the unique witness for $i,j$ in one of the samples with high probability. To extract a unique witness, one only needs to do $\log n$ distance products. For each $l=1,\ldots,\log n$, let $K_l$ be the integers whose $l$th bit is $1$, and compute the distance product of $A$ and $B$, restricted to the columns of $A$/rows of $B$ with indices in $K_l$. Then if $k$ is unique such that $C[i,j]=A[i,k]+B[k,j]$, one can compute the the binary representation of $k$ by setting to $1$ only those bits $l$ for which the distance product for $K_l$ had $C[i,j]$ as its $i,j$ entry.
Compute the product $C'$ of $A'$ with $B'$. This takes $O(Mn^\omega \log n)$ time since the bit representation of the integers in $A'$ and $B'$ has length $O(M\log n)$.
Take $A$ and $B$ whose product $C$ we want to compute, and create matrices $A'$ and $B'$ where $A'[i,j]=(n+1)^{A[i,j]}$ and $B'[i,j]=(n+1)^{B[i,j]}$ for all $i,j$.
If $\max_k A[i,k]+B[k,j] = z$, then $C'[i,j]\geq (n+1)^z$, and if $\max_k A[i,k]+B[k,j]<z$, then $C'[i,j]\leq n\cdot (n+1)^{z-1} < (n+1)^z$. Thus, $C[i,j]$ is the largest power of $n+1$ that's at most $C'[i,j]$ and hence $C$ is easy to obtain from $C'$.
With respect to question (1), in order to find for each $i,j$, the index $k$ that achieves the minimum (called the witness), one uses a method by Zwick (from Uri Zwick. 2002. All pairs shortest paths using bridging sets and rectangular matrix multiplication. J. ACM 49, 3 (May 2002), 289-317.) This method is based on ideas from an earlier paper by Alon, Galil, Margalit and Naor on finding witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication.
