Solid state drives are good for files that are accessed often such as operating system files, games, high performance applications (photoshop, video editing, etc). 
I don't meant to say that these are the only uses for the drive, you can use them however you want, but these are the most often use cases that will give you the most bang for your buck.
If you just plan on putting files on the drive, go with a HDD, if you plan on putting the operating system on the drive, playing games, or using high performance applications, get an SSD and maybe a HDD for other large files. If this is the only drive that will be in your computer, and you're willing to pay a little bit more for a slightly faster drive that will store all your files, then maybe a SSHD makes sense.
Hybrid drives are a mix between a solid state and a hard drive, meaning they work well as the host for the operating system, games, etc, but they likely won't be as fast, they are most expensive than just a HDD, but cheaper than the same side SSD.
Hard drives are best purchased for long term storage, drop a bunch of files on them that aren't often accessed, such as images, videos, etc. They are slower, but cost significantly less than flash storage. As long as you get a decent hard drive, retrieval speeds shouldn't be an issue, so a 7200RPM drive would be a good drive for photo storage.
