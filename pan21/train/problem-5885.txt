Mostly however companies protect their brand. If your game does not infringe on their brand you are probably safe. Be careful about copying rules (this also applies to video games) too closely. If you have a game that behaves nearly identical to another but with distinct artwork I think most people would consider it a derivative work, and thus infringing on the original.
Chess, checkers, dominoes, etc. are very old - literally thousands of years. They obviously have no copyrights. You can make a chess game and sell it with no problems.
ZX Spectrum games and Monopoly are copyrighted/patented; that is, the game belongs to someone. You would need to seek out the copyright holders (that is, the creator of the ZX Spectrum games or Hasbro, who own Monopoly) to make a version.
You could, however, make a game where you have to buy property and build on them. You could not use Monopoly's names, places, or rules, but something very similar.
The underlying mechanics and gameplay tend not to be covered by any legal protection. However, and this is a damn big however, as certain countries (like the US) offer software patents it seems possible that a company could indeed patent the gameplay itself.  However, for popular games the mechanics are usually so common as not likely to be granted such protection.
This will obviously vary a lot from country to country, but the basic idea is that you can't make an exact clone, but you can make a knock-off version.  Board games tend to be covered by two aspects: the copyright on the written rules of the game, the trademarks and copyrights on the visual elements to the game.
So, feel free to replicate a basic gameplay mechanic, but never duplicate graphics and avoid duplicating level-structure.
