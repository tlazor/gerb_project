Even though checking the "Include details of items marked private" box does save the dates and starting and ending times of private items in the ICS file, it does NOT include any of the actual meeting information such as title, people, etc. All it does is that it includes the private items, instead of leaving them out of the ICS file completely.
Editing the ICS to remove the CLASS: PRIVATE from items, as suggested here, does NOT allow one to see the actual content of the item because no such information is saved in the ICS file. The title of the item will be "Private appointment" even if you set class to public.
Yes, one would think that "details" would mean actual details, not just date and time. But that is not the case.
There actually apparently is no way to solve this problem without changing the items in Outlook first. 
The only workaround I can think of is to remove the private label from these meetings in Outlook but put in some other marker that they are private. Then save the ICS file, then go into that file and edit the CLASS to be private on those items, searching for them based on the marker created. Seems like quite a bit of manual labor, unless there is some way to do both steps as a batch.
