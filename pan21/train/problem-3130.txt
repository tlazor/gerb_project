Also note that if you have multiple CPUs, but you have a single-threaded application like Zope sitting behind Apache, it could be that one of your CPUs is saturated where the others are idle.  If you press "1" in top, that will show you the utilization of each individual core.  Look for one that is at 0% idle all the time, where the others are much more idle.
Using these techniques I've been able to isolate and resolve most performance problems similar to this.
If you don't have "munin" installed, you probably should.  If you do, look at the graphs to see how the system utilization changes when the system is responding slowly and when it's working well.  If you see jumps in the graphs, those might indicate where the bottle-neck is.  If you see blank areas in all the graphs, that probably means the system is saturated.  If only the Apache graphs are blank, it probably means that Apache has reached it's max connections, probably a side-effect of the performance problems.
To configure Apache to use more of your CPU, you need to get rid of the bottle-neck that is currently preventing Apache from using more CPU.  Because requests are taking 3-8 seconds to complete, you know there is some sort of bottle-neck, you need to find it.
