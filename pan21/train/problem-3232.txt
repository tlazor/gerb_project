Also just overwriting registry from one OS installation to another will corrupt the destination so that defeats the purpose
Actually you'll have more of a problem copying over the files than with copying the registry. The registry is just a few files on the disk that can be copied normally (e.g. %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SYSTEM). The problem is that when you copy files in general, you can mess up features such as hardlinks, junctions, extended attributes, permissions, etc... the only way to get that right is to get an image of the drive and restore it.
The biggest thing you're going to be missing out on with your plan are permissions. Just like files on disk, every key in the registry has an ACL, but .reg files don't include security info. If you don't copy all the ACLs over, the best possible case is that you lose a bunch of security because you make all keys readable and writable by normal users. More likely, you'll end up with registry keys that the OS refuses to accept; there's an excellent chance that the OS will just blue-screen on first boot.
Windows simply wasn't designed with this sort of usage scenario in mind. I've been fighting such cases since about 1994, when I first started using Windows NT 3.51, and I don't think I've ever gotten any kind of naively-cloned Windows install to start up cleanly. It's why there is so much specialized Windows drive cloning software on the market. We we wouldn't need all of that if a simple disk duplication worked and the OS came with the tools you needed to do that.
I'm looking to reinstall Windows on my SSD but I really don't fancy reinstalling a ton of software. Is it possible to backup the entire registry of an old Windows installation to a .reg file and then restore it on the new one on the SSD and just copy over the Program Files, ProgramData, and AppData folders to avoid reinstalling everything?
