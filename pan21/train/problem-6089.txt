I'm ballparking the numbers here, but I have 50+ machines and around 30 hard VoIP devices. Unfortunately, 10 or so PCs use the 100Mb pass-through port from the VoIP phones and 2 PCs use softphones (+sales guys use softphones when out of the office over the VPN).  
I have 2 switch locations with a couple gigabit Dell PowerEdge switches in each of them. Our building is very old, but before I started working here, it did get remodeled with Cat5e lines. If I need more ports where the PC's are sharing with it hardphones, I will be pulling them by myself.
I understand that this is a subjective question and am ready for answers that begin with - "That really depends on …"
I had kind of hoped to Vlan out VoIP from everything else, but we currently only average 10 concurrent calls throughout the day and some new lines may not be feasible.  We write software here so our data traffic varies per user.  I haven’t really looked at what the overall broadcast traffic is like.
I guess I am asking if I will see any improvement with subnetting now, or if i might as well leave it out of my planning until I have to do it.
Best Practice would be to separate out the VoIP traffic to another VLAN.  As for your requirement to use the pass-thru port, you should be able to specify a "voice" VLAN and a "data" vlan for each port.  This way the phone will utilize the voice vlan and the PC connected to the pass-thru port will utilize the data vlan.
