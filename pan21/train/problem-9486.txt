We haven't been doing any documentation at my workplace.  I'm completely new to it and ask for some guidance getting started.
I'm personally opposed to repetition for the simple fact that it makes upkeep unnecessarily difficult and time consuming. Rather than duplicate documents, or parts of documents, create references to other documents where appropriate. If something changes you should never have to change the relevant documentation more then once or in more than one place, otherwise you will have a collection of conflicting documents, which helps nobody.
While creating your documentation just keep in mind what it's for. Somebody at a later time will need to use it. Will it be usable to do the job without prior knowledge?
I've found that creating a template is a big help. In my case it's a Word template but use whatever suites you. Create a skeleton file, complete with table of contents field and sections as desired. Once you've used it a couple of times, and made any fine tuning adjustments, you'll create new documents much faster. The consistency of format will be a great help, both for document creation and later use. The documentation needs to be stored in a logical place and in a logical directory structure.
For me, the most important consideration is making it easy to use. If it's difficult to orchestrate then people will avoid it. I choose Trac's wiki as the medium for our documentation for these reasons:
I found The Practice of System and Network Administration, by Limoncelli and Hogan (aka the Sysadmin Bible) to be quite valuable because it is about "best practice" issues, such as documentation. If you don't already know about it, make sure you investigate it whenever you get the chance.
