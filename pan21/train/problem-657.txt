Secondly, whether the VPN handles "captive portal" pages. These are the pages you have to connect to on initial connection to the Wi-Fi that usually make you log in. It is at this point you are most vulnerable to attack. Because a VPN is designed to tunnel all of your traffic past the local network, obviously you cannot access the captive portal page when the VPN is fully formed. 
The use of a GOOD VPN will protect from a number of types of attack which will certainly reduce your exposure to malware.
I used public WiFi once, and ended up having to factory reset my phone due to a virus/malware. Since then, I've simply avoided public WiFi. I'm going to be signing up for a VPN service, now that the internet privacy rules have been repealed. I'm just wondering if the use of a VPN will protect me from public WiFi viruses/malware, or if it will only protect me from prying eyes?
Like @Ramhound stated, a VPN won't protect you from downloading / installing malware or viruses. Only your data will be encrypted, securing you from man-in-the-middle-attacks or from sniffing login-data, for example.
I wonder how being connected to a public WiFi infected your phone with a virus or malware. Without downloading some suspicious app or whatever, simply connecting to a public WiFi won't be a serious risk if you keep your software up to date and don't expose any important information.
Firstly whether the VPN client directs DNS queries via the VPN, some don't which massively reduces your privacy though it wouldn't impact attack protection that much.
Note, however, recent reviews of at least Android VPN's which found that many of them did absolutely nothing at all!!
