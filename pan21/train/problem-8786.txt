Any tips or pointers as to how to, once I've found the string "-Dmysql.host=" in the file, show everything to the next white space would be appreciated.
From the information given, I would go about this by first splitting everything based on whitespace, and then split those tokens based on the = sign.  Pure bash solution would be something like what follows. 
Perhaps there is a better method.  I plan on running this on a dozen machines or so eventually to return a list of which application machines are configured to talk to which db machine at a glance.
I realize there's a grep in there that sed could handle but this is just easier to write, sed can be awkward.
We have an application that grabs it's setup parameters from a file. I want to extract one or two statements from the startup string and present them as a nice table.
You should end up with a value that is the value of mysql.host.  You can put the -D in the match also if you want, but I have left it out because it is a parameter to grep and you need to escape it.
Since IFS is probably whitespace, the shell takes care of splitting based on the whitespace.  You can then use Parameter (Variable) Expansion to handle spiting into key / value pairs  based on the equals sign.
An example string would be -Dmysql.host=mysql1.company.com  but it might also be an ipaddress or a machine name and not an fqdn.
