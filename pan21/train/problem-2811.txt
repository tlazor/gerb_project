You will probably find it easier to store each product with a different size, once per line on the product table. This seems like it breaks normalisation rules ( I suppose it does a little bit), but over time as you add/remove items and manufacturers create new flavours of products but in slightly different size combinations, you will end up splitting up your products in the products table too much for maintenance.
Your system must cater for all of this and be able to recognise all items at any time as it may take you 2 years to sell out of all of them. You will probably find that having a single Product table with Name/Flavour/Size combination to be best so you would have:
Nestle come out with a new chocolate bar "Fraggleiscious". A year later they release a "Fraggleicious Mint". 2 months later they reduce the mint size bar by from 50g to 45g and change the price point while leaving the original bar the same size. 4 months later they produce a "Fraggleicious Mini" in both flavours, both at 25g. Remember that a different barcode may or may not be issued with each change.
