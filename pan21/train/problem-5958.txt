This is in spite of the fact that doing (Get-Module -Name SqlServer -ListAvailable)[0].ExportedCommands.Values lists out all of the commands that are supposed to be included:
The source of the problem seems to be a broken installation of .Net 4.7.2 that occasionally happens with installing the 1803 Windows 10 Update.
It is also worth noting that I'm only trying to use this module because the sqlps module that comes installed with SQL Server Management Studio stopped working on this machine. I don't know why that was the case; my guess was relating to a Windows or SSMS update, but in order to get to the point here where at least the SqlServer module installs without errors and warnings about clobbering, I removed that module from my $PSModulePath. Something else that broke seemingly at the same time was that my WSMan TrustedHosts list was reset (to blank), causing issues with PowerShell remoting that I had solved previously (this machine is not domain-joined).
After installing, either to -Scope CurrentUser or in an admin session, doing Import-Module SqlServer only results in three commands being imported into the session:
I tried installing an older version of the SqlServer module, as well as tried a different user account on my machine. Lots of reboots, new PS sessions, etc. Running Import-Module in verbose/debug mode doesn't throw any errors, it just imports only the function and aliases; none of the Cmdlets. The problem factor seems to be this particular Windows system, which is Windows 10 Pro 1803.
The only way I've managed to resolve this is with a Windows 10 Repair Install. This reinstalls all the core OS files and configuration but does not remove your Apps or data. But you should still make sure backup any important documents before doing it. 
You may want to try these steps before doing the Repair Install of Windows. They didn't work for my situation.
