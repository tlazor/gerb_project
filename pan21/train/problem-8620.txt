You can also find out which PIDs on your home machine they correspond to by running sudo netstat -tupn on your home machine, you'd see something along these lines (note the matching IP_ADDRESS:PORT_NUM values but with the local and foreign/remote addresses columns reversed):
The lines appear to indicate 2 active (ESTABLISHED state) ssh connections from your home machine (one maybe from an scp operation in progress or a ssh session from a different terminal or some backgrounded shell?).
Yes, netstat is a good tool to use. As long as the unauthorized access doesn't manage to circumvent somehow the way in which netstat works (which IMHO is possible, but not very likely for common attacks) you should be able to see such active connections and maybe even traces of those terminating or very recently terminated (states likes TIME_WAIT or CLOSE_WAIT).
The lines include the PIDs for the processes they correspond to on the last column, 18677 and 18843 in your case. You can check what processes they are (ps -ef | grep <PID>). For normal ssh connections they'd be sshd processes.
