I was surprised to find that one of my privileged users installed MySQL on a linux box.  The server (mysqld) is running and doing nothing.  My skills are all in Oracle, so I am unfamiliar with how to shutdown and remove the MySQL installation.
If the user happened to set up any databases, you might need to remove those as well.  In package base installation of MySQL, the table files can be found in /var/lib/mysql.  If they are elsewhere, you can just search for the table files.  They will have a .frm extension, and should be contained in a directory named after the database they are associated with.
Maybe the user himself doesn't know that he installed mysql. It can happen if mysql is a dependency of some other program. Have a look at the package manager logfile, ex: for a redhat check /var/log/yum.log. You will probably find  some more packages installed at the same time. You can then deduce what the user wanted to do, and maybe you also want to remove some other packages too that you weren't aware of the installation!
If they installed it in their own user space you would just remove the binary files that are running the server. If it is on Debian/Ubuntu you would use the method sparks mentioned. I would also alternatively use:
You didn't mention what distribution you are using, but if they installed it via yum on a RedHat based distribution you can remove with:
On a recent redhat you can for example run "yum history list", then after you found the date of installation in /var/log/yum.log, you can deduce which yum operation was related to the mysql installation, and you can for example "yum history info operation_number" to get details of the installation, or "yum history undo operation_number" to revert the operation and uninstall the related packages.
