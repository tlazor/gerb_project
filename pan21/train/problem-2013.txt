If your Ubuntu install is to screwed to get onto the network, you could always load up a liveCD and do it from there.
If the other computer isn't running Linux, you could copy to and SMB share, or even install an rsync server (deltacopy for Windows is easy).
Have you got network access and another computer? You could easily copy everything with scp -r /home/ user@othercomputer:/backup/
There are many online backup services for linux you could try, most of which are of the "set it and forget it" kind:
I tried upgrading several Ubuntu Hardy packages to versions from a later distribution and boy, did I mess up.  My computer boots but the display doesn't work and there's no internet connection.
I have /home as a separate partition so I figure I'll just reinstall Ubuntu on the root partition and I shouldn't lose any data.  But I also figure I'd better back up all my data just in case.  The /home partition has 40G space used (mostly pictures).  I figure I can transfer several GB at a time to a usb stick and from there to another computer.  It just sounds extremely tedious.  Is there a better way to do this?
If you've not got network then your options are external media; or removing the drive and putting it into another PC to do a local copy.
Put it all into an external drive. 40g is not a lot of data. "several gb at a time" on a USB stick can also be read as "32gb at a time"... 32gb is a common usb stick size today.
Backing up to thumb drive or any other kind of local storage means exposing yourself to risks (fire, theft, etc.) which offsite backup does not.
Or use your regular backups.... you do have those, or? (note: this is not an end user site - it is an administrator site. Not doing backups will get you into trouble here).
