On a separate worksheet I have a second table with the same column headers but just the unique row labels with no duplicates (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a etc.). What I would like is each cell in this worksheet to reference its row label and column header, then sum the entries in DATA with that row label and header. I tried this:
Essentially I want a table that produces summed subtotals of the data in the first table. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.
I have a worksheet of data with unique column headers (numerical IDs) and non-unique row labels. (1a, 1a,1b, 1b,2a,2b, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3a etc.). Both of these are defined ranges â€“ HEADERS and LABELS. The whole range of data is named DATA.
If HEADERS is exactly the same length as DATA, and LABELS the same depth you can use SUMPRODUCT like this
Unfortunately sumifs is not designed to work on 2D data table "The Criteria_range argument must contain the same number of rows and columns as the Sum_range argument.", you need to combine sum and offset: =sumif(labels,$a2, offset(labels,0, match(b$1, headers,0)).
