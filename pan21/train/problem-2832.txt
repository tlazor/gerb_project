"It looks like something is updating the same row at both servers with different content and made merge agent crash?"  This is handled by merge conflict tables, and would not cause the issues you are describing.  These conflict tables are located on the publisher database, and are named like:  MSMerge_conflict__.  
What you can do is query the MSrepl_errors table on the Distribution database.  This will provide you with a command_id and an xact_seqno.  You can use these values as inputs into the sys.sp_browsereplcmds stored procedure.  This will provide you with command text that is actually failing.  Using this information, you can better understand the nature of the failure.  If a particular row cannot be inserted or deleted at the subscriber, you may have to either delete the existing row (to allow the insert) or insert a dummy row (to allow the delete), respectively.
To answer your question about what reinitialization does, by default, reinitialization will take a snapshot of your published articles, drop the articles on the subscriber side, recreate the articles on the subscriber side, and then bulk load data from the snapshot into the subscriber articles.  Since this is a production environment, and those articles need to be available on the subscriber side, this should only be used as a last resort.
