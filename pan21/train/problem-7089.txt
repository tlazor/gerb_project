I have successfully set up an NFSv4 client and server, roughly following the guide at Setting Up NFS HOWTO. Both are running Ubuntu Linux 14.04. This is a small test environment without complicated authentication; the two servers just use the same passwd file. Everything seems to be working correctly; files are visible on the client, and permissions/user IDs are correct.
However, while I can get the ACL list just fine, I can't set any ACLs. Every attempt results in an Invalid argument error from setxattr. 
If you use NFSv4 ACLs on Linux-based NFS servers, I'd be curious to hear from you; I found lots of tutorials for setting up NFSv4 itself (see link at the top of this tirade), but virtually none mention the use of ACLs.
As all I needed for my test environment was a VM which could expose an NFSv4 server with ACLs, I wound up abandoning my efforts to get a Linux server going, and using a FreeBSD 10.3 image instead. Attempting to get this to work with NFSv4 was also difficult but was at least possible. There's a pretty decent guide on the FreeBSD manpage for nfsv4(4).
I used strace to see what was going on. According to the sparse documentation I've been able to find, NFSv4 ACLs are stored as binary XDR data in an extended attribute called system.nfs4_acl on the file. And sure enough, that's what's happening; setxatt is returnin EINVAL.
For what it's worth, I finally gave up on this effort after a few more stabs in the dark, which mostly involved trying an Ubuntu host with ZFS. 
Now I would like to use NFSv4 ACLs to control access to the files on the NFSv4 server. I installed the requisite command-line tools on the client, and I am able to see something that looks like an NFSv4 ACL:
What's "status 22"? Why, 22 = EINVAL, Invalid Argument, which is what setxattr is returning on the client. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to reveal anything about why the argument is considered invalid.
