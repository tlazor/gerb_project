My main concern is atomicity of this backup. As far as I know, files in Linux aren't locked. Can files be copied if only partially written? Is it possible that databases, xml files or any other frequently written files that have a structure or a syntax could end up broken or unusable at a backup location?
According to this page, you should back the database to a file and then stop it before the rsync. It's not ideal as you have to backup the whole database every time. A specialised database backup procedure is best.
I don't have the restore procedure automatized, but at least I have the data in a format easy to import into MySql and probably into other databases since the dump file is just SQL
On my Linux machine I'm using a home made backup script which is actually a few rsync calls. I've tested my restores and everything seems to be working, but are there any possible problems with this setup?
I use Bacula to do my backups, and I have it configured to run mysqldump to dump the databases into a directory for the dumps and then bacula backups this directory. I do something similar for SVN.
Yes, they can still be copied. Like suggested above I would dump the databases into a file, bzip them for good compression then rsync them to wherever
To further ease any paranoia  I sometimes revert to lsof -F | grep <keyword> to see if the file I want to transfer is actually in use, or open. If lsof returns null then I know I'm right to continue. You could use it to search for an open MySQL table as MySQL is writing to it. Once lsof returns null you can continue transferring files.
