The SnagIt screen capture utility has an option to automatically scroll through a web page and capture one continuous image.  No matter how big the page is the whole thing is captured.  This is independent of the size of the browser window in pixels.  It's the equivalent of capturing a window, scrolling, capturing another, etc. and then pasting them all together.  In fact you can see it scrolling and pausing while it works!
You have to create a fixed size web page; 16000x12800 pixels. Open Photoshop. and minimize it. And take your first screenshot. Paste into Photoshop. Go back to the browser. Hit the space. Take another shot. 
Alternatively, if you are trying to have enough desktop real estate to print something like Google Maps map tiles, you can always save the html and make adjustments to the tags and reload the html. That has worked for me too.
Most browsers tend to create new windows with an existing session even if you change the display, so you might have to close existing browser windows or use some notoriously underdocumented command-line option.
From there, just maximise your firefox browser and it will fill up the virtual desktop space, and then you can use screenshot functions that print anything within a window.
I've tried this on Ubuntu using a laptop with Nvidia GTS 360M and the scrot function and it works perfectly.
If your machine has a decent graphics card by ATI or Nvidia, it should support panning. Meaning to say, your desktop display remains at the same resolution but it creates a custom sized virtual desktop (larger than your resolution) that you can scroll around (sort of like using your monitor as a magnifying glass).
