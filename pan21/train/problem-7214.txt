So how I have it set up, all my mail from my other domains is forwarded to my main domain, but there is a spammer who has been sending mail through my web server. I think he's using a wordpress exploit to do it (even fresh installs of wordpress he still gets through). So I removed all the wordpress since it's not being used yet and it gets rid of the spammer.
I'm not sure if forwarding the domains to the google apps domain will stop mails from being able to be sent through my web server or not.
I'm also wondering if I should set up SPF and DKIM for each domain or not with the current configuration.
Thirdly, let it be noted that I am on a shared server with a reliable web host. This also means I do not have access to do things like run lines of Linux code, nor do I want to.
Second, note that Google Apps IS configured for catch all, and it MUST BE (I need it). Of course I want to RECEIVE any mail from any email, I just don't want it SENT from randomletters81273918237@mydomain.com
Alternatively I'm wondering if I should instead set up each domain as a secondary domain from within Google Apps, and then individually set up MX records, SPF, and DKIM for each other domain.
The other reason I took these screenshots is so that people coming here will see the properly set up configuration (for one domain mail, at least).
(which is in fact, an addon domain; the root domain for cpanel is forwarded to the addon domain.. i.e. aaa.com is root cpanel domain; bbb.com is set up for google apps; aaa.com, ccc.com, and ddd.com are forwarded to bbb.com)
