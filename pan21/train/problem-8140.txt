I have checked to make sure that all of the captions are not inserted in-line or in a text box. At this point I'm out of ideas.
He did this because the formatting for the headers had not been set up yet which caused the numbers for the captions to be incorrect.
The reason could be that Track Formatting is on, and some changes are not accepted. Accept all changes and try updating the fields again.
I have a large word document with quite a few tables and figures. I have created a List of Tables and a List of Figures, but both of them are missing quite a few captions. For each Figure and Table, I used the add caption function. It appears that they are only listing captions from the first 8 sections, or about 15 pages. Everything after that is being ignored.
same problem here ...then I finally realized what I was doing wrong... you need to insert each new set of tables(or figures) separately using the References/ Insert Table of Figures/label tabs... 
I figured it out. Another project member had created the later captions and had replaced the auto-incrementing numbers with his own. 
Scroll back up to your TOC, Right Click and Update entire Field (or Ctrl+A & F9). That table should now show up in your list.
