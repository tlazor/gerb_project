One heads-up: the Kinect is very picky about what USB ports it will work with. It needs a USB 3.0 port with unusually high bandwidth - so if your controller is weak or daisy-chained through a HUB it will likely refuse to cooperate or suffer low framerate. So far my best experience has been with USB 3 controllers embedded in the PC's motherboard - I've yet to find an extension card the Kinect will work with reliably & without complaint.
Also, anecdotally, I've had better luck with the Xbox One Kinect plus the separate USB adapter, than with the integrated "Kinect for Windows" model that has this built-in. Might just be that we had a bad unit, but we experienced periodic crashes with the latter.
Yes, I can confirm that the second generation Kinect works with Unity on Windows 10. I've worked on two game projects that use this setup: Glimpse and Pixelate (both were originally developed on Windows 8 / 8.1, and upgrading to Windows 10 or copying them to a Windows 10 machine has not resulted in any problems I've experienced)
