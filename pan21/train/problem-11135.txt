Here's a good example from the Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO it has the following excerpt (in case the link disappears):
My understanding of Policy Based Routing in Linux is that there are three main components, the routing tables, the routes and the rules.  I've followed many guides and in each of them this seems to be correct, so I create a route table, I add a route to it and then I add a rule for qualifying traffic to use this table.
This seems logical to me, there's a list of rules and if traffic matches the rule it looks up the route table and that tells it how to get to its destination, however this doesn't seem to work for me and I've now come across a number of other articles where straight after setting up the routing tables, the subjects then add the same routes to the main route table, I'm not sure why this is required, unless my understanding of how it's meant to work is wrong, or it doesn't work.
OK, so I totally don't get why after adding the routes to the specifically created new route table you then go and add them to the main route table, what was the point in that, can anyone explain?
