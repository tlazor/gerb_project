The glass screen looks really impressive, at least with my Dell it's bright and beautiful - and if you've looked at a newer Mac, they have beautiful glossy screens.
Well in my case, I find glass screens more resistant to my children poking at them with fingers and things.
It is very reflective.  You'll find working hard if you are in direct sunlight, even if the screen itself is not.
It's an aesthetic thing as much as anything.  The glass on the front can extend beyond the edges of the LCD, to the edge of the case.  It makes it look more seamless.
Try one before you buy!!! Don't only check it out in the store you need to check it out near a window. The glare is a deal breaker for me! I borrowed a friends to try it out and I didn't even use it a whole day. If you will be using it anywhere you cannot control the lighting it's aggravating at best.
Apple MacBooks come with glass displays.  Here's an example.  I don't know about PC manufacturers, but you'll probably see them on high-end laptops soon, if not now.
