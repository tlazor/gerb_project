If the above test all work out positively, then it looks like there is something wrong with the motherboard itself.  Contact the manufacturer for support.
The easiest way to test a power supply is with a power supply tester.  You could test manually with a multimeter, buy the tester makes it faster and easier.
A modern computer always has 5 volts coming from the power supply (plugged in, of course) to the motherboard.  This voltage is used by the physical switch used by the case to power on the machine.
You can test the switch itself with a multimeter in continuity mode by holding the probes to the exposed pins and pressing the button.  It should beep when holding the button down.  If the beep isnt continuous while holding the button, then this indicates the switch is bad.
The first thing I would do is make sure you have the latest BIOS for your motherboard.  This issue could be an ACPI bug that might have been resolved.
Next, I would test the power header on your motherboard.  The power switch should be connected to two pins on the motherboard.  Usually, the motherboard has a label next to these pins called POWER or PWR.  The power switch should be connected to these pins.  Refer to your motherboard manual if you are having an issue finding them.  If you have another power switch nearby, try using it and see if the problem still occurs.  If not, carefully use a metallic object like a screwdriver or paperclip and bridge the two pins for a fraction of a second.  If the machine immediately turns on, then you know the switch itself is bad.
Another possible problem is that there isnt enough voltage at the power header.  Set the multimeter for DC and check the voltage at the pins.  It should be either 3.3 volts or 5 volts.  If its extremely low or inconsistent, this indicates a bad power supply or motherboard.
