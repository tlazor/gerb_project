On a side note, you may want to look at using WinInstall (free) and package your installs while you are going through this process.  WinInstall lets you take a "snapshot" of the machine before you install an app and then, again, after you install / register / tweak each application.  It then creates an MSI package with all of the app's install files, any tweaks you may have made to the app, and any registration information.  If you ever run into this scenario again, or even need to MOVE your app to another machine, you can just execute the MSI file to get the app onto the machine with almost no effort.  If you do this for each of the apps during your upcoming process you will never have to worry whether or not your have the exact hardware during a recovery... just install the OS, execute a series of quiet MSIs, and then bring in your data.
Personally, I would not try to restore using the Ghost image.  You'll be introducing foreign drivers and device settings which will probably make your task much more difficult.  Instead, I would do a clean install of the OS, install Ghost, and then MOUNT the previous Ghost image to extract anything useful or to jog your memory of what you had installed.
