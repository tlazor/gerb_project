We're currently going through this debate ourselves at my company. Before Backup Exec 2010, I would have said that Veeam was the better solution. However, I went to Symantec's launch event a couple weeks ago, and came away fairly impressed. From what I could tell, Backup Exec's VMware Virtual Infrastructure agent does everything that Veeam does, and has a couple additional features.
In particular, single pass backup for Exchange, SQL Server, and Active Directory (SharePoint will be added later). The other thing that was nice to hear at the event was that they were reducing the price of the VMware by half to $1595 MSRP (per server). That's brings it in line with Veeam for dual-socket systems. However, there's an additional $2000 charge for the data de-duplication option for Backup Exec (single charge across the whole environment).
Right now, I'm just focused on getting us upgraded to vSphere 4. Once that's underway, I'll run evals of both Veeam and Backup Exec, and see how I like each one.
