In brief: I cannot Remote desktop a particular server - say "X" from "A" server, but with MSTSC /ADMIN switch I was able to RD "X" server. But the same "X" server can be RD'd from "B" server even without ADMIN Switch.
I am really worried, because I was able to RD this particular failing server from a different machine, but not from this particular server. 
I am getting this weird error - An internal error has occurred, while trying to MSTSC. I was trying to remote desktop to a server from one of our servers that has connectivity allowed. All required Ports are allowed and I was able to Remote desktop to that particular server using /admin switch but not with mstsc alone. I was able to RD to other servers fine, but not to this particular server. When I try to RD it, I am getting MSTSC crash in event viewer, I get credential page and then after entering credentials I see certificate warning and then post accepting that, it says establishing connection and after few seconds it says - An internal Error has occurred. :(
