On your router, you will need to configure the lone interface to do 802.1q VLAN trunking. I don't know how this is done on OpenBSD, but on Linux, you could do it on the CLI like this (as root, or with sudo):
You will need two VLANs, an external one between your modem and router, and an internal one between your router and 10.0.0.0/24 network. It's been years since I used a 2948G, but I believe it enumerates the GBIC ports as though they were in slot 1 of a Cat4000 chassis (e.g. 1/1, 1/2, ...), and the 48 copper ports as though they're in slot 2 (e.g. 2/1, 2/2, ...).
If we assume VLAN 1 for your internal network and VLAN 2 for the modem, your switch configuration would look like this (ignore lines starting with #):
Since your Cable modem's internal and your Linux/OpenBSD Router's External interface will need to communicate (e.g. your router will need to obtain a DHCP address from the provider via the modem), both of these interfaces should be connected to a different VLAN.
In summary, since you only need to use one VLAN, all users AND the Router's internal interface can be on VLAN 1, while the router's External interface and the Cable Modem's Internal interface can be on VLAN 2.
