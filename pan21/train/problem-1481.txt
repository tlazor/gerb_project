Buffer local means there is a default value for the variable and every buffers can have a local binding. Changes to the variable in buffers without a local binding change the default value. Changes to the variable in buffers with a local binding affect only the local binding.
So, using (setq TeX-PDF-mode t) or (TeX-PDF-mode t) in ~/.emacs should have no effect on yet to be created buffers. One has to use either (setq-default TeX-PDF-mode t), or better the provided function (TeX-global-PDF-mode t).
There is a variable and a function with the same name: TeX-PDF-mode. One can either set the variable directly with (setq TeX-PDF-mode t) or use the function (TeX-PDF-mode t). But the variable is not only buffer local, but automatically buffer local.
Automatically buffer local means that every change to the variable becomes automatically buffer local, if there wasn't already a local binding it gets created. There is no way to change the default value with setq, one has to use setq-default.
I tried to use pdflatex with Auctex and (TeX-PDF-mode t) or (setq TeX-PDF-mode t) in my ~/.emacs didn't work, so here is what I found out:
