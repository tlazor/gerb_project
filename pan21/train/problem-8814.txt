If the application sees this file, regardless of the permissions actually granted, it will tell you the file is locked because it didn't generate that lock file. If an application didn't close correctly, or was forcibly disconnected by going into standby or being unplugged from the network, it won't properly remove that lock file.
Is it possible that other users are somehow disconnecting from the share without closing the application first? i.e. laptop users that simply close the lid for Standby and go home? Perhaps other network connectivity issues?
I'd look in the shared drive for lock files - they usually start with a tilde. For example, document.docx would have a lock file in the same directory that would be ~$document.docx. This is a hidden file, so you need to enable Show Hidden Files And Folders in Explorer to see it.
Another small observation: have you noticed, a doc/xls file that is open but not yet edited actually has its timestamp modified to when it was opened (if you switch to explorer and see its listing). This is restored to the older timestamp if you close the file without any edits/save. This is because the file is opened in write mode.
The error indicates that the other user has locked the file when this user tried to open it. The read/write access controls for this user have no significance when the lock is present.
Check too that they have the ability to create files in that folder.  The program tells if it is allowed to write by the pressence of a ~$document.docx (or whatever) that it holds.  If it can not create that file or another program has the handle to it it then assumes it is read only.
MS Office applications usually open files in write mode. If someone has it opened, or if the application crashed the last time with this file open, you are likely to get this error.
