Any how, what's the best process for attempting to send that command as it is in the binary file I saved from wireshark, is there a way to send a packet containing the data from a file to the timeclock and somehow record the results?
Having identified the command, you can then write a script to make a TCP connection and send the command accurately.  You could use PowerShell or Python for this purpose.
I've got a time clock with proprietary software that polls swipe punches from it, the software sits on a server and connects to the time clock over ethernet. I want to try and write my own script that polls this clock as the software can't do it more then once an hour.
I installed wireshark on the server and polled a time clock, I then followed the tcp stream so I could see all the data that was sent back and forth, I see it issues: .00P. on port 3001 of the time clock, the time clock then replies with all of the punches.
If you've saved the binary file from the WireShark capture, a good next step would be to look more closely at that file. As you've discovered, notepad probably won't do the job.  Use a hex editor such as frhed to understand exactly what bytes are being sent.
I tried using putty and connecting on port 3001 and copying and pasting that command however nothing was returned, I then realized the periods in the command are because my editor can't display the actual data, which in notepad looks like backwards L's.
