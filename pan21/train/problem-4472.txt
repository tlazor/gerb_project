There are a couple of options for trying to repair the file structure without another OS X boot disk available:
If it reports problems it can't fix, or is still trying to fix problems after 3 or 4 tries, there's something seriously wrong and you should start thinking about backing up everything you want, erasing the drive, and starting over.  'Course, it'll be hard to reinstall the OS without an optical drive...
Try rebooting the computer with the Shift key held down.  This invokes "safe boot" mode, which runs a disk check-and-repair as part of the startup process.  Then run Disk Utility, run a Verify Disk, and see if it reports any problems.  BTW, safe boot also disables some OS features, so you'll want to reboot again normally (i.e. without the Shift key) before using the system.
It'll run a full filesystem check and attempt to repair any problems it finds.  If it fixes anything (it'll print "***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****"), run it again since it may not find all problems on the first pass.  If it reports "** The volume (whatever) appears to be OK", restart it normally with the reboot command.
If that doesn't work, you can try the single-user mode option: reboot with Command and S keys held down, and it'll start to a full-screen command-line interface.  Run the command:
