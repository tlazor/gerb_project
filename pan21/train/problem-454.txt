We want to allow our users to hit our site over the internet, but unfortunately Basic authentication is done in plain-text, which would expose our AD credentials on the net.
The answer is, you can't.  Once the user authenticates with basic authentication, his or her browser will send an Authorization header with each subsequent request, containing his or her password in the clear (only Base64 encoded).  So the only way to protect the password is to force HTTPS on the entire site, at least after they authenticate.
Really, though, what is the problem with using SSL everywhere? You're wasting effort to remove security.
You can solve this problem by using cookies rather than basic auth. See, e.g., pubcookie http://www.pubcookie.org/ or Apache2::AuthCookie http://search.cpan.org/~mschout/Apache-AuthCookie-3.15/lib/Apache2/AuthCookie.pm
I realize that I could protect the entire site with ssl, but the only thing I'm really concerned about are the credentials themselves.
You will never be able to use digest authentication with LDAP because digest auth obscures (via MD5) the password so it cannot be compared with the ldap password.
