The first point of confusion for folks is that in the account hierarchy on the left there's the "Outlook Data File" section - it shows up on top.  The Inbox, Junk-Email and some other things are NOT the same as the respective folders under the IMAP account section.  Since the "Outlook Data File" piece is on top, folks go to that Inbox (as well as other folders) and get confused when they see no mail.  The Outlook Data File section does not show if I have an Exchange account set up along side the IMAP account.  Any way to hide the section or put it below the other one?
Related, can the various sections on the left (Favorites, Outlook Data File, the IMAP account) be set to default to open vs. closed?
The other non-IMAP vs. IMAP area of confusion is the "Junk E-mail" folder.  With an Exchange account, Outlook does a nice job of detecting spam and putting it in Junk E-mail.  With IMAP accounts it catches nothing.  Should this folder work the same for IMAP?
This question isn't so much a how-to related to Outlook and IMAP but rather related to nuances of Outlook when doing IMAP email.
