Several years ago, I tried to build a tool to check similar stuff. The TL;DR answer is that I found it not possible to do with the available resources at that time. 
Alternatively tools such as SQL Negotiator Pro, Redgate etc can generate this visually for you using a GUI
This question gets more complicated when you realize that a number of queries, views and stored procedures use select * from the table that column is resident in. Then you need to look at the programs that use those results - so you need some scanner/indexer/parser capable of reading source code that may be C#, Delphi, Java, VB, ASP (classic) and so on just to try to hunt down every reference to that column. Then you need to analyze those programs to try and identify if that code is even being called any more.
This isn't really an answer to your question, but I think it bears mentioning: this is one reason why all systems outside your database should communicate via views and sprocs.  You have the build scripts for these in searchable .sql files, so you can easily see if a particular table or column is being used externally.
Of course SSIS will normally connect directly to tables, so this probably isn't much help to your need right now.  But when developers connect to your database and complain about having to wait for you (or whomever is serving as DBA) to make the views and sprocs they need, you can tell them: "Any table or column may be deleted or renamed.  I'm only obligated to keep you informed of changes to views and sprocs."  And they only have to do regression testing for these specific changes.
