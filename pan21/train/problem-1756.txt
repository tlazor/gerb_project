Trying to grab the torrent was a good move. Most BitTorrent clients will let you re-check downloads, which will quickly tell you if your download is corrupted.
Another way of looking for controller problems is to open uTorrent (or your BitTorrent client of choice) and force re-check everything you've downloaded in the last few weeks. If a bunch of your downloads change from 100% done to 99% done (or any similar number), your hard drive controller is at fault.
You might also want to run memtest86 to verify that your memory isn't bad.  It's possible that you've got a few bad spots in RAM that are corrupting your downloads.  If you can get a known good copy of an Ubuntu CD, you can boot the netbook off of it and start memtest86 from there.  You can also get a standalone version here
Now for the bad news: the fact that you downloaded the ISO file from multiple sources and still ended up with corrupted files points to a possible hardware problem on your netbook (most likely a damaged hard drive controller). To see if this is the case, use another PC to download the same ISO file. Run a hash check on that PC to verify a clean download. Then, copy the ISO over to your netbook and run a hash check again.
