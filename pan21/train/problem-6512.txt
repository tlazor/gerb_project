I'm trying to wipe a 2TB hard drive ready for sale. I was told to zero it out with 7 passes so it would be secure and no-one would be able to retrieve my information. But I'm struggling to find a program that will perform one pass in less than 24 hours let alone 7 passes. 
If you're really paranoid, the only way to absolutely securely erase a drive is with a large hammer.
Re-Writing all the data 7 times will take time - about 7 times more time than filling the drive with irrelevant date once, yet ought to be more 'random' than filling it with files.
I was just wondering out of interest and maybe for some fun, would it be secure to overwrite the data and occupy the empty space with 2000 1GB films?
Completely overwriting a drive several times would make it difficult to recover the original data, but not necessarily absolutely impossible - it depends on whether it's a couple of home movies & some bank details, or you had plans to blow up somebody's embassy as to whether the effort required would be worth it.
