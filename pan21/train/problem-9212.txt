If you don't have admin rights you probably won't be able to troubleshoot the issue without your DBAs. 
If you don't have any access to the server's log files and/or the admin views this issue is hard to resolve. Team up with your DBAs 
Account was already locked when the user tried.  The script will show you the exact hour it was locked.  Before the 28000 you should have at least 3 of the 1017 which was the user that locked it.
There are really only two ways for an account to get a status of 'locked'.  First is for someone with proper privileges - like a DBA - to issue ALTER USER  ACCOUNT LOCK; The second is for someone - or more likely, some process - to repeatedly try to connect with the wrong password until the number of failed attempts exceeds the value of FAILED_LOGON_ATTEMPTS set in the profile assigned to the user.  My money is on the second.  You've got a job/process/application that has been given the wrong password (the password recently changed and the process wasn't updated) and just keeps hammering with the wrong pwd.
