I'm assuming this isn't possible with S3; I can use any similar service. It just needs to be able to serve static files.
I'm assuming that you would create separate S3 buckets for each subdomain. You would need your DNS server to have a wildcard record, but where the requested name is prepended to the response. For example, the following domains would be dynamically generated:
S3 requires the bucket to exist in the first place... so without a bit of work, the short answer is that it can't be done out of the box.
1. When a user signs up - use the AWSSDK to create an s3 bucket with the slug at the front... (ie - company.example.com)
Then you've got to configure all the permissions issues as well - who can access etc - using IAM and s3 policies.  Fair bit of work.
(Note: I'm making a file host, where people can sign up for their-subdomain.my-host-domain.com. The host would just serve static files from their subdomain on my domain.)
I know it's possible to have a subdomain point to an s3 bucket (so, I could use something like s3.example.com). Is it possible to use wildcard DNS with S3 (or something like it) to do the following?
