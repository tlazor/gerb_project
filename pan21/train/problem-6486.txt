What MIME type are you sending along with the .zip file?  I have had errors similar with dynamic download pages (such as download.php sending a file) and compression.  When using something like application-zip and Content-Encoding: gzip, IE would not uncompress the file.  I corrected this by using a MIME type of application/octet-stream, if I recall correctly.
I have a zip file being served by Apache with mod_gzip compression turned on. Everything is fine when the file is downloaded with Firefox. When downloaded with IE7 the zip file is corrupt. Any suggestions? Do I need to change the mime type for zip files or perhaps exclude zip files from gzip compression?
That being said, you should probably exclude .zip from gzip compression anyway, since it's probably useless if not actually hurting performance. 
you should definitely exclude the zip file from gzip compression. There is no need in compressing already compressed content again. This is not only valid for zip files but also for jpg and so on.
