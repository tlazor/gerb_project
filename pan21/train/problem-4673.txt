My next step might be to disconnect the hard drive and hope that it automatically attempts to find a bootable drive and finds the usb drive....  But I've never disconnected a h/d on a tiny little netbook before, and it looks easy to break something.
Doing a bit of research, you just need to remove the base and it has a standard hard drive inside it - here's a nice video on the process. In this specific scenario, The only sensible thing is to remove the drive, load it onto another system and either crack the password with something like ophcrack or the lovely chntpw to change the password
I offered to fix a friend's netbook, she locked herself out of windows 7 with forgotten password.  I figured easy enough - I'll just boot into linux distro and apply any number of windows 7 password cracks.  Problem is, I can't seem to figure out a way to boot into anything but the main hard drive.  
If the Acer netbook is windows-based, it may have a recovery partition on the hard drive.  Try the keypress combination of Alt+F10 at power on.  You might be able to use this to reset the netbook to factory defaults, i.e. reinstall Windows.  Be advised, this will erase everything on the hard drive.
Acer's tablets and netbooks are notorious for not being able to boot off USB devices.  You can take the hard drive out and attach it to another computer via a SATA to USB adapter and use one of the many free password clearing/resetting tools out there.
As for the BIOS password, there should be a CMOS battery that you can pull and leave out for a while to clear it.
