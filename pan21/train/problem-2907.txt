We use a domain account as a service account. If the password is entered wrong during the install phase, it will usually hammer & lock out the service account, and cause much consternation among the agents using that account. 
Try making sure that the remote registry service is started and that CIFS is not being blocked at the firewall.
FWIW, we do our deployment via a script in Group Policy, so that whenever a new PC comes on the domain, it is checked for Sophos and gets it installed if it is not already.  Never had much luck with the Protect Computers way.
In my experience, "Installation did not start"  is the MSI package for the antivirus engine itself failing.   Check for pending reboots or anything else that might prevent an MSI package from installing.  The Auto-Update service is what gets pushed & installed from the Enterprise console, and it bootstraps the Agent install from a cached installer.
It doesn't sound as though you're still dealing with Win2000 machines, but for those I've found that putting the local Sophos service account into the local Administrators group fixes the troubles we had there.   The same technique may work for later versions of Windows.
