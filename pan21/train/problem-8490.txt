It takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. After that boot the pi using this new sdcard. And enjoy the same OS which you have it on the old sdcard
Also you can write this image made from 32 GB to a 16 GB or 8 GB disk, it is not complaining about that the image is too large anymore.
I am using a Win7 machine and a bunch of Pis. Some of them took weeks to configure. I would like to backup their SD cards in case they break. It should be backed up so that if it breaks I could simply buy a new card and reload the backup onto it and plug into the Pi. When I put the cards in my SD card reader on the Windows machine, it does not recognize it as containing files.
A disk imager should be able to make a full image of your card, even if the underlying OS can't read the partitions on that card. Win32DiskImager is popular on Windows. The image will be the size of the full card, whether or not you actually use all of the space, so a 32 GB card will yield a 32 GB image file. You do have to ensure that the target disk is larger than the source image.
