I am trying to estimate whether it is realistic for me to change the IP of a mail server overnight or will this mess with people retrieving their email the day after. Basically, the facility where the mail server is will be changing its IP pool and this forces me to have to change the A and MX record for the mail server. Since I am not changing the DNS server itself (not moving the records to a different authoritative server), will the change be near instantaneous or will it still take up to 48 hours because of caching on different non authoritative DNS servers that may have queried recently?
Here's an article outlining failover/backup MX records:  http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/mail.html
Do you already know the new IP address?  If so, you're in luck!  Setup a new A record, subdomain for your domain, pointing to the new IP, then add that as an extra MX record; set the priority higher on the new one than the old MX record. Do this a couple of days before the new IP is supposed to be activated.  After the new IP address is active, remove the old MX record, leaving the new MX record.   Remember to update your SOA serial each time you make edits.
The lower the TTL is set the better - you usually won't get to "instantaneous" because of all the DNS servers out there which have diverse caching behaviours but the lower TTL is set the better your results will be...
