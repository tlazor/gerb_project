One caution specifically to point out: if you boot from an LVM2 logical volume you made find recovery operations difficult when the server crashes.  Knoppix and friends don't always have the right stuff for that.  So, we decided that our /boot directory would be on it's own partition and would always be small and native.
Another advantage: you can add a new physical volume (PV), move all the data to that PV and then remove the old PV without any service interruptions.   I've used that capability at least four times in the past five years.
For example, we use it widely here at my work and have taken time to teach the whole team the basics, the language and the bare essentials about recovering systems that don't boot correctly.
A disadvantage I didn't see pointed out clearly yet:  There's a somewhat steep learning curve for LVM2. Mostly in the abstraction it creates between your files and the underlying media.  If you work with just a few people who share chores on a set of servers, you may find the extra complexity overwhelming for your team as a whole.  Larger teams dedicated to the IT work will generally not have such a problem.
