When you then script for CREATE from the Object Explorer, SSMS will script the object as an sp_executesql statement, fully double-quoted.
While this may not look as pretty with quick strings, it may clear up issues with large blocks of DSQL.  To further clean it up, I also suggest you mask special characters with variables such as:
This format works well for me as I have to make changes to some objects during development, and then make the same changes on multiple other databases. I can just change the database and click execute.
With tons of values in the Cross Apply, it just gets annoying. How can I easily export the definition of an object to have double/quad quotes?
I apparently cannot figure out the key words to google search for what I want, so I need help finding out how to do this. I feel like this may be a duplicate, but I just cannot find this anywhere else.
In my scripts that I want to keep clean, I often take this approach with Tabs CHAR(9) and newline (crlf) characters CHAR(13) + CHAR(10)
In case this helps anyone else, an alternative approach to the using double single-quotes to represent a single single-quote in a string is CHAR(39).  That sentence is hard to follow, so as an example:
However, some of the scripts have A LOT of quotes in them, and it gets QUITE annoying to have to double/quad quote them every time I make a change or add a new object to the file. For instance...
In SSMS, you can check the option "Check for object existence" in Tools/Options/SQL Server Object Explorer/Scripting/Object Scripting options.
I would like to be able to easily save a bunch of create table/view/proc scripts to a file. The file has an easy-to-execute format that will drop and then re-create all of the objects, so it can be run on multiple databases.
