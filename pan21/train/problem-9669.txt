You could put each port in the switch in a different vlan and then add virtual vlan interfaces on the router. Then you could ping each device from the router specifying the virtual vlan interface as the source. Still alot of work.
Each small router would only have to be configured once. Each device to be tested can be left connected for as long as required, and no devices need have their configuration changed throughout the test, ensuring that the test environment is stable, and minimal time is spent debugging network issues.
You could do this with a multiport router that supports NAT but it would take alot of time to configure properly and a router with alot of ports gets expensive.
If you weren't set on the 'one router' requirement, several small SOHO-grade routers could be configured all with the same LAN-side settings, to which you'd attach your equipment to be tested, one to each router.  The WAN side could then be addressed either on its own private network, or your office LAN's network.  Port forwarding could be easily set up on each small router, that if addressed in a mnemonic fashion, you would access device #1 by telnetting to A.B.C.101; device #2 A.B.C.102, ...  DNS could even be set up to further simplify the testing environment.
