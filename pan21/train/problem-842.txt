alternately, use netsh advfirewall consec add rule  from the command line.  You get some useful help text when you type just that.  
The following config is how the connection is established. Can anyone help me as to how I'd go about creating this VPN connection on a Windows 7 machine. I've been researching on-line but don't understand enough of the existing script to attempt creating the connection on Windows. I understand there used to be a tool called ipseccmd.exe which seems to have parameters that match some of these but I don't think this included in the later versions of Windows?
It's a complicated topic, and the answer is going to depend on how the other end of your tunnel is configured.  I'm not familiar with OpenBSD's ipsec implementation, but my guess is that you need to do "lan-to-lan" mode on windows, even though one of your endpoints is not a LAN, it's just a single machine.  (technically, i guess it's a /32 LAN with one member :)
Note that you need the "advanced firewall" that comes with windows 7 professional (I think) and enterprise (I'm sure).  I don't think it is part of the "home" edition.  
I am working on a project which needs to call a web service that can only be accessed whilst being connected via a VPN. The legacy platform that we're migrating from ran on OpenBSD and used the built-in IPSec tools to create the connection.
