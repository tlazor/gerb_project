I have come across some devices by a companay called "Lantronix" that produce 'Secure Access Servers'. 
So, why not just connect the switch/router/etc. directly over IP to the Laptop/PC and eliminate the need for the access server? Well, because there are some operations that can only be performed over the device's serial interface. One example is bootloader/rommon upgrades. Another is to gather early device boot up logs at which point the device's Networking stack is not yet ready and therefore syslog is not usable.
"Lantronix console managers provide effective in-band and out-of-band management solutions for IT equipment in data centers, network edges, colocations, remote sites, branch offices, and engineering test labs. These products provide network and system managers unsurpassed ability to securely and remotely manage IT assets including switches, routers, storage devices, security appliances, power management devices (PDU, UPS), telecom equipment, and servers even during system or network outages to maintain business continuity."
The description makes it sound like they are physical devices that pretty much do what Terminal programs like PuTTy, SecureCRT, HyperTerminal, etc... do?
I know Lantronix as a maker of COM servers - essentially, they allowed you to connect a simple serial port to a network.
Terminal server describes this functionality of local console port access which allows you to power cycle and/or configure the box remotely. HP's iLOM ports offers this capability all baked in. Cisco's UCS servers offer something called CIMC, Cisco Integrated Management Controller.
You still have to run PuTTY etc. on your Laptop/PC to connect to the Lantronix. You distinguish between devices by specifying different TCP port numbers.
For it to be out-of-band, the network used to access the terminal server must be separate from the network provided by the equipment you are accessing.
