Yes, I am overthinking it and it probably wouldn't be fun. I'm just trying to narrow down the reasoning, especially games like modern warfare 2 which in terms of weapons are pretty much accurate in every other regard.
Having asked this very question to a student team building an FPS, their answer was that they wanted to reward "prepared" players who reloaded often (making sure they had a full clip before going into a big fight). If they lost 3/4 of a clip every time they reloaded, that'd be, in design terms, punishing them.
Ultimately, it was s a result of design balancing to sacrifice a minute element of realism for the sake of rewarding player choices.
There is a similar concept in many games; that you don't have to explicitly do every little thing. Some things can be assumed, ie. unless you are literally under fire all the time, you will have time to consolidate those 15 rounds into a single magazine. The fact the game doesn't show this is for the exact reason you've already highlighted: sitting down and moving ammo around isn't fun. Shooting things is.
For example, I have 3 magazines with 30 rounds in each, I fire off 25 rounds and do a magazine change. I do this another 2 times so i technically have 3 magazines with 5 rounds in each, but when i reload I have a magazine with 15 rounds, somehow they have all jumped into the one magazine. 
In those situations the games in question aren't going for realism. Instead they are simplifying the game for the player by not punishing the behaviour of reloading too soon.
THAT BEING SAID there are a few games where you lose the clip each time you reload, meaning the player has to choose between having a full clip readied and losing ammo, or preserving bullets but only having 1/2 a clip. This seems to be more suited to survival/horror style gameplay rather than action.
