Root servers don't answer queries for second-level domains. gTLD servers don't answer queries for second-level domains (other than returning the name servers for second-level domains). The authoratative name servers for the second-level domain answer queries for that second-level domain. You can query a gTLD to find the name servers for a specific domain and then query those name servers for resource records in that domain.
What I'd like to know is how to force the dig tool to return the info from the root servers itself. Is it possible, at all?
To get authoritative information using dig you usually use a combination of +trace and @server. For example, if I want authorative information about www.google.com I would do it like this: 
Now I have the nameservers that are listed for google.com, as well as the IP address of one of them. I can ask this nameserver directly for the records:
When doing a dig over some site (i.e. www.nasa.gov) from different online dig tool sites(in this case, http://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Tools/dig.php and http://www.kloth.net/services/dig.php), I've noticed their answers are different. I guess this must mean that the answers each one of them is getting is not from root dns servers but from local ones, instead (for example, their ISPs).
However I think, that what you mean you want an answer from an authoritative server. In order to do that do:
Root servers should never be asked a recursive query (i.e.) for a server.example.tld, only about the servers handling the top level domains (.tld in the example).
