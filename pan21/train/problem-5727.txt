Why not do the install to your external hard drive on that other Mini? That is, use the Mini the install disc belongs to. Since you are installing to an external drive all you need is time on the other Mac Mini. You won't be touching any of its other resources.
A suggestion. Once you've got your test installation set up the way you want it on the external drive, boot from the main drive and create a .DMG image of your test partition. That way you can restore it to it's "pristine" state just by restoring the saved image. (Perhaps this is too obvious to bother suggesting? ... oh, well).
I want to do some slightly dangerous testing, testing an install package I've written, so I've got an external drive, and I want to make it a bootable OSX disk, then I can boot up on the external, do my install, and if it screws things up, it doesn't actually affect the usability of my machine.
The problem is that when I stick the disk that came with my computer (It's actually another computer in the office, but they're both minis) in and try to run the installer, it says "You cannot install OSx 10.6 on this computer". Now, the computer is ALREADY running 10.6, so that's a kind of silly error message... 
If for some (bureaucratic?) reason using the Mac Mini which matches the install media is not an option, then how about buying a retail copy of Snow Leopard? $30 seems like a reasonable amount to pay to work around this.
