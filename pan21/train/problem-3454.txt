EDIT @massimo already answered this (and I didn't realize he covered the attach-disk solution). But, since I already typed this up, I'll leave the answer here, since it contains a bit more detail about attaching a disk from a locked-out VM...
Azure provides an extension to recover access to Linux VMs in many scenarios. Jointly with custom script, as @proteus mentioned, you should be able to fix this without recreating the VM.
To access your VM's disk if you're locked out, you can delete the Virtual Machine (but not delete the disk/vhd or any attached disks), which breaks the lease on the page blob holding the vhd. Then, you should be able to attach the vhd to a running Linux VM as an attached disk. At this point, you should be able to access the files on the disk.
If you have installed the custom script extension, you may use it to disable or configure your firewall.
I have a Linux server on Microsoft Azure. It's an Ubuntu 14 Server. Apparently, I've done something wrong with the UFW (firewall) configuration and now I can't ssh into machine at all. I need to disable the firewall to get back into machine. I assume the only option I have now is to try to do it via PowerShell since Azure doesn't provide any KVM access. 
I don't know anything about the firewall config and if you'll be able to alter it this way, but at least you'll have file-level access.
