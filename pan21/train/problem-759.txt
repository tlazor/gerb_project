This makes me think the motherboard or SATA controller is probably the issue. Does anyone know of any further tests I can do to help narrow this down? 
I have a Samsung 1.5TB hard drive hooked up to an ECS H55H-I mini-ITX motherboard. I have XBMC 10 (modified Ubuntu 10.04) installed for use as an HTPC. The hard drive encounters occasional errors during normal use which cause it to be remounted read-only. I have updated the BIOS on the motherboard, changed the SATA cable and moved it to different ports on the motherboard, installed and re-installed the OS (including different versions of XBMC and generic ubuntu), all to no avail. I recently ran tests both with badblocks -sv and smartctl -t long. Both reported no errors. 
I saw a Windows executable and a DOS based test.  I haven't tried the DOS based, it would probably be best for you since you're running Linux (you'll probably be able to download a CD and run it from bootup).  Otherwise, it will at least let you run it from a Windows machine through an external enclosure (and hopefully rule out the hard drive or find an error)
Here's a link to Seagate's Hard Drive Utility.  A nice feature is that it is usable not only on their drives.  I've seen some other utilities from hard drive manufacturers which only work if the firmware of the drive reports that it's one of theirs.
The processor is a Core i3. I forget the model number but it's one of the 32nm ones with on-package graphics. There's no discrete video card or optical drive. The power supply is a 150W Rosewill (pretty sure) that came with the case.
