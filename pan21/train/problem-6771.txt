Use Ultimate Boot CD to wipe the drives and reset the BIOS. That's all you can do from a software standpoint. The reset is to take it apart physically.
(Ohhhh, btw, should the OS you actively have on your drive be unix-based, you can actually use rm rf with root privilages on the terminal to make the OS wipe the whole drive :) )
From there, you can enter the diskpart command, then select disk 0 to select the first hard disk (use list disk to find the correct disk number). Now enter clean all to completely erase the disk (overwrite with zeros).
The reason i suggest UBCD is because it has a secure wipe which will prevent the data on the drives from being recovered whereas windows format, you can still recover the data is you so choose at a later date.
If you want to "reset" a computer as near "pre-assembly specs" as possible, you need to wipe the drives, reset the BIOS and disassemble the individual parts.
You mentioned that you have the Windows 10 installation media on a USB drive. If you press Shift+F10 in the Windows Setup program, it will open a Command Prompt.
Use a bootable media (USB, cd, dvd, even a network boot would suffice) to live boot the computer with an OS of your choice. 
Wiping the drives, so that they are completely empty or filled with random bits can be achieved with a bootable (USB/CD-ROM) system like DBAN: https://dban.org/ (instructions to create media, etc can be found under Help / Installation Questions).
Some BIOSes offer a disk wipe option (mostly laptops, though), so it might be worth checking that out too.
If your computer(s) are already disassembled, you need to connect the drives to another computer (via USB or internally via SATA) and do the wiping there.
Once in the OS of your choice, use disk utilities or the terminal to completely erase any drive connected to the system.
