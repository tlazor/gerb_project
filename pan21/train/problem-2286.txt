On a Server 2012R2 DNS computer forwarders should not be necessary, if you can access the internet from this server. When you install DNS the root hints will be populated which takes the place of forwarders. Most vm infrastructures are configured with routing enabled.  Spin up a test vm and try it without forwarders. 
Yup, most people don't lock down their DCs to not have outbound access to the Internet.  They are typically set to be able to make outgoing requests just like all the other computers on your network.
The DC has two physical network interfaces (typically named External and Internal) and I've disabled the External interface based on best practices.  The External interface would be used for forwarding DNS requests.
If you really think you need to do this for security reasons in your environment, then you are going to need to setup some kind of recursive DNS server in a DMZ or something that can resolve things on the internet, then set your DNS server on your DC to forward to that server.
I'm bringing a new Windows 2012 R2 Domain Controller online.  Its very well documented that a DC should NOT have multiple network interfaces.  My DC will also host DNS.  I'd like to configure forwarders on the DNS server but without an external network interface this would never work.  The enabled Internal network interface is on a private network and does not have internet access.  Am I missing something?
