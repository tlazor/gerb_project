Of course, a good registrar will regenerate the glue records for you automatically, but since you haven't said who your registrar is, it's impossible to comment further on this.
Your nameservers are unlikely to change unless your registrar is exceptionally stupid, but you will probably lose your glue records and have to set these up again with the new registrar. Do this immediately after the transfer, or while the transfer is still in progress, if possible. There's not likely to be any immediate impact, since the root nameservers generally cache glue records for quite a while, but it's still not something you should delay.
This can be confusing, because people inexperienced with DNS assume that domain registration and DNS hosting are one in the same, when in fact, DNS hosting is usually a complimentary or cheap service offered by registrars. There's no requirement that the two be bundled. 
If you leave them at the same. If you are the typical non-profesional end user level setup then likely the DNS is part of a package the registrar provides you with and they normally do that only for domains they have - then no, it is time to reenter them.
If you run a professional setup (or: larger setup) where the DNS is separate from the registrar, then the name servers are only changed if you do that (which is a separate operation).
TomTom has answered this already, but I'll try again and maybe you'll understand from a different point of view. 
If you have to ask this question, you likely fall into bucket #2, but you haven't told us if you self-host your authoritative DNS servers yourself, or if your registrar hosts it for you.
