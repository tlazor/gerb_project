Now in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, under Security --> Logins I've created a user and I've set its Server Roles to dbcreator and sysadmin. However, I've tried the credential I've just created and other credentials that are on our AD domain admin users, and no matter which credential I've tried, it still won't let me login to install. Am I missing a step?  
I am a newly promoted entry level Systems Administrator and the first project I was tasked with was to spin up a new server and install Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection utilizing an external database. I got everything spunned up, however, Malwarebytes won't connect to the database. When it prompts for me to choose "Use Embedded Database," or "Use External Database" I choose the "use external." I then type in the database address, which is the server and instance, then the username and password. This is where I get hung up. I get an error message stating "Login failed for user ..." "Installation was unable to access the database."
