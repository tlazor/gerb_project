I am moving from Europe to the USA. I want to take a 500gb hard drive with me. What's the best way to go about this? I'd really like the information on the drive to arrive safely, although it's not mission-critical data.
I think the best thing you can do is be very careful and wrap it up in bubble wrap or socks - something that will stop/cushion impacts.
If you're truly paranoid, though, I would do what has been suggested previously, and make a duplicate. If you have a friend in the US, you could even scp (or similar) the drive to one here so the data gets transferred electronically, and then if something happens to the physical drive you have, your data has still arrived intact.
After this, there are a few caddies you can get and other equipment, but, it all comes down to luck.
I have tried various methods and have had mixed results - it is all down to how rough the baggage handlers are (or you are if hand luggage).
I have a few ideas on how to physically secure the drive, but I want to make sure it's magnetically/electronically secure as well. 
Hard drives are shipped to folks around the world in cardboard boxes with foam, paper, and "air" bags. They arrive fine all the time. How would this be any different?
First, I would say take a backup to either DVDs (safest) or another hard drive (changes of two getting damaged are very small).
Assume that the drive will not be on my person during the trip, but will be transported in packages/airplane cargo holds.
