Because the logo is part of Microsoft's intellectual property, you probably won't be able to find a legit 3rd party font that includes it.  
Microsoft's Windows icon has changed multiple times throughout the past decade.   In doing so, the Windows key's icon has changed as well, from Windows XP to the most modern iteration, Windows 8.
I think your best bet will be to create your own font with the symbols you want, being sure to be aware of whatever trademark notices you have to display if it includes 3rd party logos.  It's probably a lot of overhead for what you want to do, so you'll have to decide if the time-investment is worth the use-value you get.
