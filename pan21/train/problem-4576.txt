You pull that apart and there's a decent chance you're not getting it put back together. In either case, you'll need to remove the cooler from the CPU / motherboard entirely to make sure that you don't damage any components trying to rip the cooler apart. You don't save any time or work on disassembly by only going for the fan. 
If a cooler doesn't list these specifications anywhere (check multiple sellers and the manufacturer site) then it is not worth purchasing.
If you don't want to  buy a used one then you can find aftermarket low profile coolers for $15-35 USD. You don't need anything high end for normal use. Relevant metrics will be:
You can't replace the fan without replacing the entire plastic  housing on most of the stock Intel coolers. The fan assembly is built right into that plastic frame, which you can see by looking into the gap where the wires connect the fan, as well as between the fan itself and that plastic frame where you can see the bearing assembly and the motor.
There are other problems with this approach as well. Just from disassembly we've  exposed either the motor or the bearing assembly which means that dirt and dust can get in there now. You can see that you'll also be required to have some  soldering tools and skills at your disposal as well.
You can find cheap used ones on sites like craigslist and ebay for about $10 USD very easily, just get one that matches the motherboard socket / CPU generation you have in your PC.
You will also need some thermal paste to install the new (or used) cooler. I recommend Arctic Silver 5 for reliable performance and longevity at a good price. There are better pastes out there in terms of thermal conductivity but they tend to dry out faster on average than Arctic Silver.
