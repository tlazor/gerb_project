Key to gaining a level of security here that you see as sufficient is implementing layers of defence, both technical and procedural:
Segregation - place the server on a DMZ, with a connection to the Internet, but no connection onwards to your network. To create this DMZ, you could use firewalls, or routers with access control lists, and configure them to deny all connections from this server to anything else - only allow connection from the client to the server (and it's responses back.)
Well, I'm not 100% sure about that, but when connecting to a network, Windows Vista and later (and respective Sevrer versions) ask you if the network is Public, Work or Home network. If you set it to Public, you have access to the Internet, but it cannot access any other PC connected at the same network. I don't know though if this has an impact on RDP or you can simply setup the firewall and your router to allow remote access. Try it to see if it works. If it does work, then it is what you need. You can control the computer remotely, do stuff, but the server cannot access other PCs since the file sharing is disabled by default. As another choice, you could go to the other PCs and forbid any access of the server using its computer name or IP. I don't know how to do that, probably from the Windows Firewall.
Authentication - mutual authentication of devices (by certificate) helps you ensure that only the correct client can connect to the server, and that the client knows it is connecting to the server
Patching - keeping the server (and the firewall) up to date prevents attackers using known weaknesses to get past your controls.
