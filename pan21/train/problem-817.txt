"If at all we find multiple iscsi ports to the storage enclosure, the storage can be used only by splitting i.e., works as two storage devices and the same storage can't be used by both the
If all you want is a bunch of shared disks shared between EXACTLY two hosts then I'd suggest you look at something like the HPE MSA2040 SAS disk system. As the name suggests it's SAS but it's setup to allow two servers to connect to it and both servers see the various logical disks you setup on the box. This way in the event of one server falling over the other can still see the same disks. You can set this up with OCFS2, GFS and a few other file systems - even NTFS with Server 2012/R2 when used with cluster services. It's pretty much the cheapest way you can do this unless you want to use FC/FCoE/iSCSI etc.
