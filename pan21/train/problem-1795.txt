I understand there are services out there like Unblockus.com that will give you a US IP address or whatever but I am not sure how they work. Please explain specifically what those services actually do and how I can apply that to my own home network to unblock Netflix and other services.
Perhaps using a VPN connection would work in your case, you can setup a router that supports VPN and tunnel all your home network traffic and it would appear as if you are located in the US, it will be transparent to all your local PCs and SmartTV etc.
I suspect that the unblock.us site doesn't proxy the actual data stream but jsu the control streams. netflix has caching servers in many ISPs COLOs and I supect they have separate control and data streams.
I am physically located in Japan but am a United States citizen serving on a U.S military installation so I'm "technically" in the United States. When I go to websites, for example www.google.com, I get redirected to the Japanese equivelent www.google.co.jp unless I use a suffix like www.google.com/ncr or /en. That happens on everything and for all sorts of services. Netflix and Amazon streaming video is blocked entirely based on the fact that I am in Japan.
I believe UnblockUs uses a combination of proxy servers / mirrors of the services they support and reroute traffic to these servers by having clients go through their DNS servers.
