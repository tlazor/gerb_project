If you need to restore you can always copy the Time Machine disk to a real USB or TB drive and mount it on the Mac - sure it is a pain, but really how often does that happen? Alternatively you can first rebuild the OS and reinstall the iSCSI driver, or boot off a Super Duper clone (assuming you have one).
TimeMachine backups to USB, Firewire or Thunderbolt drives backup natively, while TimeCapsule and other Network drives get a 'SparseBundle" pseudo drive.
As I understand it there is a huge advantage for iSCSI that outweighs the issues above - it is seen as a local disk to the OS.
In my experience timeMachine on a sparse bundle always fails at some point in its life and has to be scrapped - especially over WiFi. I have had nothing but bad experiences using that system.
However (in theory) an iSCSI connection will use a native format (no sparse bundle) which seems much better.
I think your biggest drawback between the two is when recovering... i used iSCSI for TimeMachine before, and it worked grand for backing up, but when i tried recovering from the Lion DVD, it would not see the drive. I had to install Lion manually, then the iSCSI initiator, and then recover files i needed... With AFP, in theory, you should be able to install Lion (or any other OSX for that matter) and then select your backup location and your golden...
I use Time machine with an iSCSI Target(D-Llink DSN-1100) all the time.  Disconnecting and reconnecting a volume will not have ill effects on the volume or time machine.
