When you boot from the Ubuntu stick, you will have a network connection, so you can read the Boot Repair installation and operation instructions online, as you fix your system, no need to save beforehand. Also, if you are wondering why I did not suggest to download BootRepair earlier, it is because live distributions like Ubuntu's do not keep a copy of what you install: in other words, after installing Boot-Repair, if you turn the system off, the install of Boot-Repair on the USB stick will vanish. So you need to do it on the fly. 
You may need a recovery tool after the Debian install, so you might as well prepare it beforehand: download Ubuntu, and burn it to a USB stick.  
Now install Debian with your installer. After you are done, reboot. Your system may or may not reboot correctly. If it does, fine. If it does not, reboot from the Ubuntu stick, choose Try Ubuntu without installing it, open a terminal, download BootRepair as detailed here, follow those standard instructions which are generally sufficient to solve all problems.
