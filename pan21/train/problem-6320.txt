If in doubt, you can always go safer way: simply compress entire Installer map! Right click on the Installer map (or just $PatchCache$ map) and choose Properties. On General tab, click Advanced button. Finally, check Compress folders to save disk space. If asked, choose an option to compress all subfolders and files.
You can apply this tactic to several other non-essential system maps, thus recovering lots of free space on your drive!
Should you? Probably not, if you don't have to.  Windows Installer keeps those files around because it think they're needed if you ever have to install another patch on top of them (or uninstall those particular patches).
What I do for this folder is revisit it every now and then and only delete packages in there that are at least six months old.  This way, if there's a bad patch that I need to roll back, I can usually still do it.
This way you can gain up to 30% of free space (or in your case, nearly 300MB), and you keep everything in case you'll need this stuff later on. And system speed and response wont be affected much since system rarely accesses this map.
I think it should be safe to remove the files, provided you're able to download them again in future if they're needed or if you have access to your original install disks. I had something similar on my computer, I just deleted it and install things from the original disk every time it asks me now. Inconvenient, yeah; but I don't often install stuff and it's a lot better than having a whole ton of space on my hard drive wasted.
