When I tried to use ForceBindIP and opened Firefox without forcing it to use one of the connections, it used the last one that an app was forced to use.
I believe Windows makes the last used network connection to default for apps to use when not being forced to use a specific one, at least that's what happened to me.
IP routes have "metrics", which can be used as an order value for otherwise equivalent routes. Most operating systems try to assign those intelligently â€“ for example, if you can access the Internet over both wired Ethernet and wireless WiFi, you will have two "default" routes, but the wired one will have a lower metric and will be preferred.
(This is not a very good example, since both eth0 and wlan0 are connected to the same network, with the same default gateway. With multiple ISPs, you would see two default routes.)
Hosts have a single default route. Generally it will use only one. A router can be configured for failover, but still any connection will use only one path.
