To others: I had this exact same problem. Nearly identical screenshot to this one. Max usage, low throughput, latency through the roof. I tried disabling services--like indexing--, chkdsk, power management options, and even crazy things like disabling IPv6 per an Amazon review of my drive (desperate, I know). Nothing I did worked. So I did some research on my drive and unfortunately found that many many other users were experiencing the same issue.
Ultimately, I emailed the manufacturer of my drive and laid out my case, stating that this drive model was defective and requesting that I can send it in and receive the next model up in return (which has 1000+ good reviews). A friendly phone call later and for a very small fee, they complied (negotiate down their fee!). Yesterday I got the new drive and it's night and day. Incomparable. The old SSD was slower than spinning by a large margin, and the new one feels like every other proper SSD I've used. It's wonderful.
If you found this page because of similar issues, spinning or SSD, I'd highly suggest you do some Googling and potentially follow-up with the manufacturer to exchange it. I am very glad I did. Good luck.
