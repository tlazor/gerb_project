As long as the bios supports it there shouldn't be any particular issues.  The boot sequence basically starts with the bios recognizing a master drive with an master boot record (MBR) where windows is stored and then calling the windows bootloader.  Since windows has eSATA support and basically just abstracts the hardware as drive letters like C: it will just read the files off of the disk regardless of hardware interface
On the internet there are on one hand lots of resources stating that it's not possible to install win7 on USB/Firewire disks (although some workarounds for XP exist). The only source 
which sounds more or less hopeful is http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/can-i-install-windows-7-64-bit-on-external-esata/e08dd9e5-a4f4-47d5-afc3-a0325ad045ac )
Hence my question, do any of you guys/girls have a either a working setup with a win7 installed on an eSATA(p) port ? Or do you have an explanation why booting from eSATA(p) might not work ? (read: how is the eSATAp electrically interfaced with the remainder of the system ?)
I'm the proud owner of a Lenovo W520 which is equipped with an eSATA (eSATAp actually) port. However I'd like to attach an external eSATA drive to it, install Win7 on this external drive and boot from it.
Some Lenovo forum stats the BIOS would support booting from eSATA (ref http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/W-Series-ThinkPad-Laptops/W510-W520-can-they-boot-from-Esata/td-p/550335 ). However there they do not explicitly mention Windows like operating systems.
