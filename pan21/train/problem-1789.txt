I have a N-Tier system for our clients to access data, and we're finding that our current logging system (built into the server application) is insufficient for storing all the data we need.  Now, I need to find a new solution for saving and storing logs, and was looking at two different options that I could find: using a remote syslog setup, and rolling my own system.  The problem with a remote syslog system is the 1024 character limit, and a roll-my-own system is undesirable due to stability issues.  Ideally, I'd like to have a system that I can just fire off the log entry from the server and forget about it.  Does anyone know of any other options I have available?  
Syslog is the tried and true, to my mind. What are you referring to by this ? Doing some googling, I don't see any such limit in syslog.
Splunk looked pretty good, but we couldn't justify the price compared to a roll-your-own, so I had to roll up a basic logging server using a UDP connection.  Fortunately, a 64k size limit gives me the ability to send 99%+ of my log messages through with just one UDP datagram.  
You might take a look at Splunk, it is expensive but it has log forward agents on each server that can handle almost any format.  The GUI is wonderful, and has some very powerful search and reporting tools.
syslog-ng via TCP works pretty well, but as you stated it is limited to more or less single line logs.
