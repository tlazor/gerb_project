This way you can use a Wired router and a small switch to distibute internet access to all apartments, this takes the wireless headaches out of the picture for you.
Here is one I found by googling, though I have never used it, it should provide enough coverage for the apartment complex.
String Cat 6 cable to each apartment, that way each user can use a router (wired or wireless-their choice) in their apartment, solves the distance problem and each apartment will have their own private network (if they choose to use a router).
You'll want a router that supports b/g/n since the new computers have been shipping with 'n' compatable cards for a few years now.  The 'n' standard increases the range.  You also probably want to look for a router that can put out a fair amount of power (measured in milliwatts)

Remember it does not matter how powerful your router is when it comes to range, all the users PCs will also have to have the enough wireless power to reach your router as well, a double edge problem you have. 
We are going to buy a single internet connection for our whole apartment complex, 6 people (non heavy users) over 3 floors. We will have the router in a room in the middle of complex. We already have the cable modem. Do you guys have any router recommendations? The signal will have to go through floors/walls and will be wifi for all users.
Alternatively, you could get a trusty linksys that supports 'n' which will probably be enough.  You can always return it and get the higher power one, but I find that linksys routers are more reliable.
