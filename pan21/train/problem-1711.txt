I managed to get it to work by changing the site in IIS to use the Application Pool Identity, then changing the Application Pool Identity to Network Service. Feel free to comment on any security issues this may raise.
It is most likely not the DOMAIN\computer$ at all. This message is known to be a misleading. I think all it wants is that  "NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE" be granted the server access. Open SQL Server login properties and add this account. Also, check what user is used in the IIS to impersonate anonymous user, it should be something like "IUSR_ServerName". Grant access to this user as well
Both @cha and @alt have right clues - the error message is misleading and Application Pool Identity is involved (well, at least it was in my case).
If your IIS app's application pool uses Application Pool Identity, the user account you need to add to SQL Server is IIS APPPOOL\your_app_pool_name. Note: don't use the Search... button in Login Properties to find this user - it will find it, but will substitute it with MACHINE_NAME\your_app_pool_name which won't work - just type IIS APPPOOL\your_app_pool_name as the login name.
