Tunnels are going to increase your latency, not lower it - you're not only adding some level of processing time, you're also forcing traffic to take a probably non-ideal route.
This is possibly the most important rule in MMO development. Never trust the client. This isn't just for game design, and this question is a perfect example of why.
On top of that, they're not making anything any more secure. If your game client has the ability to get onto the VPN, then anyone who has access to your game client has access to your VPN. Attackers can again attack your server, but now they have two possible targets - the VPN servers or the game server. You still need to properly control access to the server on your VPN network as you would otherwise, with a firewall and probably a load balancer or other front-end.
As other answers have mentioned, using a VPN solution isn't the right choice here. Not only are you not going to solve your problem with it, you're going to make it worse. Here's why:
Instead, design your server architecture in a way that's both scalable and able to fail-over nicely. Commonly, this means having front-end servers (both in the sense of multiple machines, and multiple processes) that do nothing more than authenticate users and pass on or filter traffic; and having multiple actual game-running server machines/processes that can be respawned if they fail, or added to as more capacity is needed.
