By default, the .ZIP file you download is blocked from being executed.  Right-click it and choose "Unblock" before you unpack it, and the files beneath will be unblocked as well.
The files are not "blocked", I've checked each one individually (as well as run Unblock-File on the directory).  Permissions from the server end are fine, I've verified that I have access to everything.  What have I not checked?
Rather than load the module directly from a share, I tend to have a function that copies it locally (this can be adjusted to look for newer versions as well). I suppose this could be written in-line, but I made it a function as part of my 'common modules' that I load.
Sorry that when I originally posted, I didn't see that you said you had unblocked it.  I only got the error (identical error code) while the files were in a blocked state.
I was receiving the same error when trying to load the module from one of my scripts.  I went and re-downloaded the newer v2.3 and extracted it into my Powershell Modules folder (C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\Modules\NTFSSecurity).  
I've created a central repository for Powershell modules, but I'm having trouble loading one in particular.  The NTFSSecurity module is failing to import with the following message.
I'm running Windows Managment Foundation 3.0 Beta, which includes PowerShell 3.0.  I have a feeling that the new security measures introduced in .NET 4.0 are playing a part in this, but running Powershell.exe with the -version 2.0 switch doesn't fix anything either.  I have modified my powershell.exe.config files in both the system32 and SysWOW64 folders to the following.
