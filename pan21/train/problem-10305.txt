I also keep some of what Dan Meyer calls "Tiny Games" in my back pocket, for any time that the internet is down or we can't get on computers. Not all of them are explicitly CS related, but I think the logical thinking is useful. 
Worksheets - I use 'em, but I don't really like 'em. I do keep a set of worksheets printed though just in case nothing is working. They're generic enough that it really doesn't matter what topic we're on. And they work well for emergency sub plans.
I kept a copy of Amelia Bedilia around to read, when I was at a school where the power would go out.  If the power was out long enough, we would do pseudocode algorithms, or something of that sort until the power turned back on.
I also had a set of identical LEGO cars and kept one set of instructions, and did sort of a network simulation to have groups build the cars by carrying instructions from the "server" (who had the one set of instructions).
CS Unplugged - I 've got the count the dots activity printed out. One set on normal sized paper for me to demo with and a dozen sets printed on business cards for students to practice with. 
A kind of fun one might be to have a little kit of electronic components handy - transistors, LEDs, a couple of batteries, as fits the size of your class. You can build logic gates and then use these to build, say a half-adder, or whatever, and start abstracting from there, to introduce computer architecture, or you can use it to solve some sort of simple problem, or introduce truth tables, or whatever. It's also a fairly compact thing to store for those unfortunate occasions.
I'm guessing everyone here, high school teachers at least, have spent at least one period in the past year working with a class when you either don't have working computers or a working internet connection.
It depends so much on what we're covering.  In principle, anything which gets them doing or moving also gets them learning.  Here are a few more ideas:
