Don't get too hung up about your NICs - a fault-tolerant 1Gbps NIC configuration will be ample.  Your bottleneck will still be disk.
Of course you can pretty much do the same thing with the built-in perfmon and Task Explorer utilities.
Process Monitor (again, SysInternals) has some very good summary reports.  Out of the box though, Performance Monitor (perfmon) will give I/O figures (read, write or both), plus disk performance.  You might be more interested in the actual disk performance (random reads, random writes, sustained reads (streaming), etc).  I've used MS' SQLIO for this in the past.  Takes a few mins to get working, but it's good for benchmarking.  You can then run the same test on your new server, with the same config file, to see if things have improved.
If you are going to be running VSS Shadow Copies on your server, definitel use 2008R2 or 2012 (i.e.: x64).  Install plenty of RAM, and ensure your page file is at least RAM*1.5.  I'm only recommending this from experience.  We're running file servers of this spec. with 20+ TB of online data with no problem (24GB of RAM, though!).  These servers run on-access virus scanning and multiple VSS snapshots during the day.
Download a tool such as Sysinternals ProcExplorer to view open file handles and concurrent disk access.
