you can find out the full path by right clinking the folder from the tool bar at the top (eg test as in the example above) and selct 'copy address as text' and then put it in your search bar which will give you the full UNC path
Anyway, I think I may have a solution for you. If you right click the desktop-> personalize, then click "window color", then "click advanced appearance settings.."; from there you can try and mess around with the icon size, icon spacing vertical/horizontal, plus a few other ones. I had a problem with the way my icons were being displayed and this was the only area I found in Windows 7 64 bit where you could change/edit icon settings.
Unfortunately that's just not the way it works in Windows 7 anymore, and there doesn't seem to be an in-built way to adjust the Explorer row heights (or alike) for these icon sizes.
Some of these people are answering questions that you are not asking. I think they believe you have a problem finding the full path of your files/folder.
