If you can find the worst performing of the queries, post them here or on a good SQL forum and someone will definitely help you. As it is, the question's way too broad to have a simple answer.
That's not a simple question and doesn't have a simple answer. Entire books have been written on the subject of performance optimisation.
Maybe try starting with these articles which go into (in the first part) finding the performance problems.

We have a Classic ASP web-application that we are hosting with a 3rd party hosting provider (Rackspace).  We have ~ 100 databases on a SQL server and around the same number of websites on a Web-Server (IIS).  Does anyone have any tips for optimizing performance.  We occasionally see memory and CPU spikes throughout the day.  We are setup with a simple SQL server and Web-server pair.
