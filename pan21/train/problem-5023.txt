Still don't know how to make this locally with vlc or any stream client, but I used wget + cron to get "3 just played songs" from web-site of this radio into text files.
Personally I listen to DI premium with Winamp and then use Streamripper to save the tracks. Streamripper is clever enough to save each track as its own file as opposed to one long stream file with track name and artist. Word of warning though is I found Winamp doesn't like sharing bandwidth Streamripper even if there is enough space and you will find that Winamp will jump between "tracks" ( term used loosely as it all connects to DI and is the same stream, the pls file inserts three connections to Winamp ) and unless you have repeat on, it will stop playing. With repeat on you will hear the jump live but it does not get recorded.
VLC includes support for submitting tracks to Last.fm. If you sign up at Last.fm and enter your password to VLC preferences, played tracks will be recorded in your Last.fm profile, even with statistics.
DI listener for 7 years. Cant function without it now :) i dont record unless its an epic track. Takes up too much memory.
