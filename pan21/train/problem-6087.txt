Finally, sblair's comment is correct, the TRIM passthrough only works for SSDs that are not actually part of the RAID.  For example, if you had a boot SSD, plus a separate RAID 1 or RAID 0 pair of mechanical hard drives, TRIM would work on the SSD.  If it's a pair of SSDs that you have in RAID 0, TRIM still won't work yet.
The "F6" drivers are only necessary during the installation of Windows, and they were only necessary for versions of Windows earlier than Win 7.  In previous versions of Windows, there was no built-in AHCI or Intel Matrix RAID / RST driver, so you had to hit the F6 key and load suitable drivers from a floppy in order to proceed.  So you don't need those.
The .exe file is the installer for the drivers you want.  I assume that if you have RAID 0 set up and your system is working, that your BIOS was set to RAID (not IDE or AHCI) when you installed Windows.  If you change that setting after Windows is installed, you either have to reinstall Windows or change some registry settings before changing the BIOS.
