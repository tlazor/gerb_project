A router transfers packets between two (or more) different networks. A typical case is a router sitting between the home or office network and the ISP's network. A more complex case might have several separate LANs, a separate VoIP network, multiple ISP connections and several VPNs.
There are cases where the ISP provides a connection which is directly usable by the router (like a plain Gigabit-Ethernet link). In such a case, there will be no obvious modem box (even though Gigabit-Ethernet is actually a modulated signal - the Ethernet transceiver is therefore a modem, just not as visible as a typical obvious modem box used to translate DOCSIS, ADSL, VDSL, SDSL or whatever to Ethernet or whatever else).
There is also the option to set up complex routed networks without physical network hardware (and therefore no modem, not even Ethernet transceivers). Just a bunch of virtual machines, connected to each others via virtual network adapters and virtual switches. A use case for such a setup might be the test of router software, running in one or more of the VMs, with clients and servers running in other VMs.
