The "least impactful" approach is to probably go with a NAT router which can service multiple public/WAN IPs - whether that is through the Comcast equipment (if it has the functionality you need) or through a replacement of the Linksys. That will allow you to specify per IP-to-port mappings for each Internet/WAN IP simultaneously, so your current internal IP plan can stay the same. 
TommyB, I was close to your exact position with Comcast. I do IT for a living, was using Comcast home service, running a Windows server, including Exchange for e-mail. My port 25 kept getting blocked, so I moved to business class. I also use Dynamic DNS, and have a SonicWALL firewall in the middle.
This will allow you to essentially keep everything behind the firewall the same (no changes to DHCP or configuring servers' NICs with wan IPs).
In the alternative, if you are OK with the Comcast modem/router as a firewall, it also does 1-to-1 NAT (as well as port forwarding), allowing you to use multiple external IP's and map them to internal servers.
Sounds like the best way would be to put your Comcast modem/router into bridge mode, then get a business class router/firewall (I like Sonicwall) and configure the WAN interface with your static IP addresses.  In the firewall and NAT rules on the Sonicwall, setup the ports (Sonicwalls actually have a handy wizard for this):
When they put in my business-class modem/router with its small switch, it became clear very early on that the new modem would not work because it did not handle bridging so it kept giving a 192.168.x.x IP address to the WAN interface of my SonicWALL which was being reported to my dynamic DNS provider, so I had three choices:
I chose the last, and have been working that way for over a year, but since you already made the commitment to the statics, ask them about putting it into bridged mode. You will probably need to upgrade your Linksys to a more functional firewall.
