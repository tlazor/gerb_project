This way when Users visit http://www.url.com/folder/, they get a Directory listing denied error. But when they visit http://www.url.com/folder/file.jpg they can see the file.
Yes. Add an index.html file that lists the contents of the folder and restrict access to that file with .htaccess.  If you want the index to be dynamic you'll need to use some sort of script (or server side include) to generate the index.
Here Require valid-user requires any known login. Then you amend this restriction for files with at least one character in their name – this is what the glob pattern ?* for the <Files> section will match –, which effectively means the enclosed rules apply to files, but not to directories.
So now browsing this directory or any of its subdirectories will require a login, but directly retrieving a file from it won’t.
In the amended rules for files, the key is Satisfy any. It allows the authorization to satisfied by either credentials or IP address. Then you allow any IP address to pass, so requests are always authorised.
If you want the directory listing to be visible to only authroized users but allow anyone to download a file (so you can send people links), then you need a script of some type (PHP, ASP, etc.) which asks the user for a password and if they get it right displays the contents of the directory.  You would put this script in the directory and name it as index.php so it gets served rather than apache generating a directory index.
