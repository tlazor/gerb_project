Corruption is a serious, serious problem though Microsoft has done almost nothing to help people deal with or even recognize it. Thus a strong backup strategy is even more incumbent with Excel files than with others. Keep in mind that just one generation of backup may not rescue you, because corruption is usually viciously silent, very much like cancer, and your latest seemingly good backup may be corrupt. Periodic non-overwritten backups (one per year, one per month, or whatever you decide) is one tactic of defense against the cancerous condition of corruption.
Excel found unreadable content in *******.xls. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click yes
As strange as this suggestion sounds, people have made dramatic, emphatic claims that they were at the point of hopeless defeat in opening a file, until they tried this, and it opened. It may be worth the effort for you to try it.
Even then you may still have work to do to build a new workbook to get you to where you were before it went corrupt, but at least you can get to the data if this works, and hopefully formulas too, and ideally other aspects of file contents.
