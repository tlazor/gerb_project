Export all your virtual machines to OVF. Uninstall VMWare. Install VirtualBox. Import virtual machines. This solved my problems after wasting several days and reading over 100 pages of "why bridged network does not work on VMWare".
I too had problems with VMNET0 not working as bridged after upgrading to Windows 10.  I am currently using VMWare Workstation 12.  I was able to resolve this by going to control panel, opening programs and features, right-clicking on VMWare Workstation and selecting the Repair option.  After the repair was completed (yes, it showed network drivers being removed/installed) a reboot was required and all is now good.  VMNET0 working properly as bridged.  I hope this helps.
after installing VMWare Workstation on a new machine I came across the above error which I’d never seen before – there were no currently-bridged adapters available to bind my virtual network to.
If not, add the service and choose “VMware ridge Protocol” from the next dialogue box. If there are no services to install then it is likely that your install is corrupted and a reinstallation 
I believe the trigger was disabling the 2 automatically created virtual network adapters before I’d actually opened up a VM. The long and short of it os that the bridging kernel driver is not running, probably due to the fact that the vmware bridge protocol is not installed on the physical network adapter(s).
Uninstall your anti-virus software (in case of Kaspersky IS you can keep your license data), reboot, install VMWare Workstation - Profit! :)
