During this loss of connectivity I check the routing via ROUTE PRINT and the routes are show that the change has happened, if I do an IPCONFIG it show the changes there as well. I thought it was a gateway issue but I still get no connectivity even if I change IP address from 192.168.0.10 to 192.168.0.20 which should be near instantaneous but no it makes the change (as it shows up in IPCONFIG/ROUTE etc) and then take 3 mins to make the connection and provide connectivity.
As soon as it's change then I get full network connectivity but on my main Win7 PC nothing happens for 3mins then I do get connectivity. Now both PC are the same Win7 etc.
If I make the change and then do a ping from a cmd window then the ping does nothing and sits then (not even timing out) for 3 mins and then when the interface become available the ping then does it ping 4 times.
So, lets say my PC is stable and I want to route my gateway to another PC which connects to my backup ADSL line. On another PC if I change the gateway via network properties or using
I have enven run a Network Monitor (Microsoft 3.4) and it shows that connectivity is there before the change, then as I make a change then the network monitor does not show any traffic for 3 mins then it starts showing traffic.
Now when I boot-up, reboot,resume from sleep or change a network setting I get approx 3mins of no network connectivity.
It must be having an issue somewhere and something is obviously waiting for a timeout of 3 mins before the interface come up with connectivity.
