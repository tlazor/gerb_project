Oracle doesn't understand the literal date format strings, as they are not in the same format that your client is configured for. You need to use the TO_DATE function to tell Oracle the format of the date string you are presenting it with, like so:
If ACTIVITY.ACTIVITY_START_DATE has the DATE data type, the comparison should look something like this (you cannot always compare dates with stings in the Oracle Database):
