Our server has been moved to the datacenter, while I am here working in a different city. Networking is not my strong suit, and after installing I wanted to bond the two nics together to improve throughput. But in doing so I lost connectivity as the networking interface failed initialization. 
I thus today needed to bridge the connection for the vm inside the server.... Low and behold, I lost connectivity again and it's the second trip my boss will make this month to the datacenter. :facepalm:  
When changing network configurations remotely, is there a way for the networking to attempt to use a different configuration file in the case of a failure?
There's gotta be a way, where if the interface isn't detected as up that the networking will use a completely different set of config files, a failsafe, if you will, so that after the failed networking attempt, a cron job running every five minutes would reestablish the network connection to the failsafe if the network is down.
Unfortunately this didn't work, and the only person qualified enough to go to the datacenter to do the support is my boss. Not a good situation. (And I had tested it twice on a virtual server just to make sure I wouldn't lost connectivity) 
I wish I had access to a linux box right now, but I usually check the network by doing a service network restart command. Is there a way to give it a failsafe command that if the network is not detected, that it will in turn, try a different failsafe configuration, until it is up. 
I've been searching around but I'm not really seeing any references to doing something like passing a file to ifup, although saying that gave me an idea to check the man page for ifup, but irregardless. I can't test it right now. 
Now, we have it bonded but there is no way to do a "just in case" configuration so far as I can tell...
