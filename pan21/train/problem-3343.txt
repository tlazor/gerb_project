The login table holds a foreign key to a categories table that will hold types of user logins (either customer or employee for now). By keeping it separate, it won't be a requirement for any person to have a web access account. Business rules can dictate if the employee requires an account, it can be created with their initial addition into the server.
I've read other methods to create a table for login information and they referenced a LEFT JOIN in SQL, but that seems like it would only be good if I was referencing 1 other table and not two different tables. How can I pull EMPLOYEE information if the Login ID entered is from the EMPLOYEE tables and vice versa for customers?
I am creating a sample web application for a business and I am stuck at the login implementation. There is supposed to be two different users (login types?). I will have employees and customers. I have a table for employees and a table for customers set up already. Let me caveat that I understand the following is not SQL, just the notes I've taken so far in a .txt file.
