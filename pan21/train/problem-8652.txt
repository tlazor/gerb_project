You can easily verify if this could be the problem in your access.log: You should have plenty of requests from your server's IP address, all in a very short time. This works until you hit the MaxClients setting or until your system runs out of resources. The only fix is to fix the PHP program in question.
I believe it is referring to this timeout. It could be that something is opening the connection, then not doing anything (i.e. the client isn't sending anything after opening the connection or maybe a script of yours isn't closing the connection after writing data to the client) and Apache waits for 45 seconds before giving up. It then closes the connection. You could lower this so Apache times out dud connection attempts quicker but the better solution would be to try and determine why this happens in the first place.
It is a long shot, but I have had problems like this one. I don't remember exactly what error message it was, but the reason for the problem has always been a buggy PHP program which created recursive requests (i.e. the program requests a URL which in turn re-requests the same URL etc). I have seen this for example in connection with ErrorDocument settings, where the document which should have handled the error was buggy or non-existing and which triggered an error.
