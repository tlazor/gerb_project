And finally, if all this turns out to work correctly, I have one last question. What would be better, an AMD Phenom II x6 2.8ghz CPU, or an AMD Unlocked FX x4 3.6ghz CPU? I don't want to trade good for worse!
Now, there is also a problem with my motherboard. I have a Gigabyte M68MT-S2P. On the specifications page it says it supports, quote, "AM3 processors: AMD Phenom™ II processor/ AMD Athlon™ II processor". It does not mention anything about this mystical "AMD Unlocked FX (Of which, by the way, I've never even heard of)". Will the accidentally purchased CPU work on my motherboard?
The CPU my dad bought is, as it says on the box, an "AMD Unlocked FX x4" and my dad says its a 3.6ghz clock speed. My brothers motherboard only supports the AMD Phenom II chipset. My CPU is an AMD Phenom II x6 2.8ghz. Here's the first place I'm worried. On the motherboard box of my brothers computer, it says "AMD Phenom II x4". Does this mean that 4 cores is the MAX? If so, then my CPU would not work. 
So, my father (being not so computer-savvy) accidentally bought the wrong CPU for my brothers computer. He was going to send it back, but then I thought maybe it would work in my computer, and my brother could use my CPU. However, I will only feel safe if I guarantee this will work. Hardware specifications can sometimes be just as they are described--specific--but sometimes I've found there are work arounds.
