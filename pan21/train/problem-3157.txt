I am also running it at home on the same router, which lives in my HOT attic.  The temperature doesnt seem to affect it at all, even under a heavy load.  
We use OpenWRT at work, both in the office and DC.  It'll handle as many machines as your wireless bandwidth will support, as far as I can tell.  I don't know how long we've been using it, it was here when I got here.
We use DD-WRT on a Linksys router. It handles 20 users just fine, been using it for over a year, much more powerful than standard Linksys firmware.
We have used DDWRT for over a year now and have never had an prob with it.  We run it on a WRT54G that is on and open to the public 24/7.  I may have had to restart it 3 times in the last year or so.  We frequently have 15-25 wireless users.
There is plenty of support for DDWRT online and I would definitely recommend it.  If you have read anything about it you know that it has a ton of features that just arent available anywhere else. (features here http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_%22DD-WRT%22%3F#Features )
