Ultimately you can probably call them whatever you want, there isn't a lot of standardization. It's possible (as noted in the comments) that more thematic or contextual options might exist if you provided more information about the setting of your game.
So a player could say "I'm on the second puzzle of group three" or "Those tier-5 challenges are really hard!"
What terms are common to refer to "outer levels" and "inner levels" in such a situation? The game is very abstract, so something like "world" for the outer level would be inappropriate.
My game has a 2-tier hierarchy of levels, it is composed of 6 or more "outer levels" that consist of 8 or more "inner levels". Reaching an inner level unlocks the next inner level. Reaching the top inner level of an outer level unlocks the next outer level. The first inner levels of an outer level resemble the inner levels of the previous outer level, but each outer level has more inner levels than its predecessor.
The actual terminology you use, "outer" and "inner," also seems viable if a little technical. Other options might be "overworld" and "world," or "major" and "minor" levels. Older games sometimes used "world" and "stage" (or the reverse, in a few cases if I remember correctly).
