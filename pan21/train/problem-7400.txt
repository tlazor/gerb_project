Another possibility might be that the Network Location Awareness service (in charge of the NCSI testing) is not running, although in this case I would not expect the system to say "No Internet Access".
with the registry editor. There are different values that specify the server to use (both for DNS and HTTP test) and the expected results. If there is nothing unexpected there, a possibility would be that when you request http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt with a browser, you're going through a proxy that has access to Internet, while the computer doesn't. A network capture (e.g., with Wireshark) is often very useful to figure out many types of connectivity problems. Try to do a capture for some minutes, and check if you see any NCSI-related traffic and what the outcome is.
As you mention that the computer is joined to a domain, it is possible that there is a group policy setting a custom NCSI server instead of the default one from Microsoft. You should be able to see if there is a custom server defined by looking under
Be sure to manually type the commands as certain characters get messed up between the clipboard and a webpage and DOS or PowerShell windows. I use this technique every time and it probably saves me a good 30-45 minutes each time.
I've also seen weird things with mixed drivers. During the builds if your not using a deployment tool you can still install the Dell Driver packs directly from DOS and basically loop through the installation of all drivers. When you download the Driver Pack they also have a list on Dell's support site that lists if there's more current drivers available or known issues with devices. To install the driver pack from DOS check out the tutorial here: http://www.1337admin.org/tutorials/manual-installation-of-a-dell-driver-pack-on-a-local-machine/
