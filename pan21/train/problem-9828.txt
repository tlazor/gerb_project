You've got one channel connected and the rest of the pins floating.  Those pins that are floating are, well, floating, and there's not reason to think they should have any value in particular nor that whatever value they have will remain constant.  That's not "noise" in any usual sense of the word because noise is usually with reference to a signal and those unconnected pins have no signal associated with them.
If you did see noise on the channel that's connected, however, there's nothing here to suggest that's the ADC rather than noise at the sensor or actual, detectable variations in the lighting.
The pin that is connect to your sensor doesn't demonstrate any characteristics of noise either, at least in the fully lit room.  It is, as far as I can follow your description, showing a maxed out (constant) value in the lit room and a constant value in the darkened room.  If it were noise, the values would be changing around a signal level.  It's not clear from your description if that's happening or not as the text around where you say "500 or 600 (+/- 100)" doesn't clearly indicate if that's a time-series fluctuation in a reading or the result of several different attempts.  
So based on the information that you've given so far, there's no clear indication that you're seeing anything unusual.
