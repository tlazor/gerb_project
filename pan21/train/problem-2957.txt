Why do I want this? To put it simply, I want to setup a Bacula server and client. The server has to resolve "SomeName" to a local IP (static, no problem here) and the client has to resolve it to a public IP (dynamic, namely "AnotherName.dyndns.org").
Is there any easy and straightforward way to achieve this? I couldn't find such an option for DNSMasq or BIND. I suppose one could write a script that gets the domain's IP and rewrites the config file, then reloads the DNS server, but that would be so ugly.
I have a local domain name "SomeName" and an Internet domain "AnotherName.dyndns.org" whose IP can change at any time (it uses a dynamic DNS). I want to resolve "SomeName" to "AnotherName.dyndns.org"'s IP. In other words, if "AnotherName.dyndns.org" points to 1.2.3.4, I want "SomeName" to point to that same IP, namely 1.2.3.4.
What i understand is you are looking for Split DNS configuration. It also called views in BIND language. So you will create two view Private (local) and Public (Internet) and create ACL list to match your source IP address from where query coming base on that it will give you whatever IP address you want to give to client. for example if your request coming from private ip address 192.168.100.x then DNS will give you "SomeName" 1.2.3.4 and if query coming from public domain it will give you "SomeName" 202.67.29.x
