Most good FTP programs also have an auto setting, which means they will determine the mode (BINARY or ASCII) depending on well known file extensions, e.g. it will automatically switch the transfer for JPG file to BINARY and send/receive a PHP file in ASCII mode.
What operating system are you transferring files to/from? Linux/Unix use different line breaks then Windows. So if you generate a file on a linux computer and open it on windows it may look weird. There are utilities to correct this though in my experience if you use wordpad on windows instead of notepad you'll be fine.
So technically for binary formats (zip, jpg, png, and endless others) you need to set the FTP to BINARY, while for text formats (HTML, PHP, CGI, etc.) you need to set it to ASCII.
Windows and Unix have different bytes at the end of lines (Windows a 0D 0A hex, Unix just a 0A).  When transferring files in Binary mode, the bytes of a file will be moved from one computer unchanged.  This is required for binary formats (e.g. ZIP files, Images, etc.) but can lead to problems with text files:  E.g. notepad.exe on Windows will display a text file with just unix style line breaks as one long line, a unix editor might show ^M at the end of every line when seeing Windows style.
