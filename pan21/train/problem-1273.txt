However it is possible to reduce the time window for snap-shotting the system significantly (e.g. by removing a mirror from a RAID set then remounting it elsewhere). And the shorter the time it takes to generate the snapshot, the less likely that transactions will span the operation.
This will dump the fs on your source machine, copy it over ssh and on the target machine it will restore it.
You'll end up with a virtual image of your server when you're done, rather than a raw disk image, but it's usually good enough for most work, depending on what you want to do with it once you've done it.
Its impossible to get a consistent snapshot without stopping all operations which may change the state of the system.
And most filesystems / DBS will support some sort of journalling which should allow most broken operations to be either recovered or rolled back.
Unless the application has been explicitly designed to accomodate this kind of operation (i.e. all processing handled via queueable messages) it is be impossible to get a consistent snapshot without bringing the system down (or at least disabling the transactional component).
VMWare Converter can do most modern OS's without shutting the server down, but as Dennis pointed out, we really need to know which OS you're running.
Which VM platform are you migrating to? VMWare has a converter for Linux. It'll convert a powered on machine.
