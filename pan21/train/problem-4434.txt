By hammering the connection, your machine will be sending a lot more packets and will get a lot more back - e.g. 2% of 1,000,000 packets is a lot more than 2% of 500 packets... (just non technical/random example).... which is why a download manager such as IDM which specifically opens multiple connections can give you higher speeds.
In addition, as for why other stuff appears to be faster - all I can think of is that the equipment they are using prioritises traffic based on where the most connections already are.
As for why you are seeing what you are seeing, there is no single rule and it depends on the networking equipment you use, but basically, when under load, the majority of networking equipment simply only delivers a few percentage of the total amount of traffic it should do - whilst UDP connections (voice/skype/other) will suffer, through the magic of TCP, it will keep resending and you will get the data in the end - you just see a lot of lag.
By the way that standard network communication works, without QOS or similar technologies, nothing is guaranteed and it is simply down to best effort.
