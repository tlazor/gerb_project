I could place a switch in the fray and connect everything to a switch but that reduces reliability if the switch goes down then the whole network will not be able to connect to anything as the star topology will no longer be there. 
You've assigned the network address (where all the bits not masked are zero) which is not allowed.  For your subnet, the interface address can be anything OTHER than zero (the last 8 bits are all zero) or 255 (the last 8 bits are all ones).  The most common convention is to have the router be the lowest numbered address of the IP block.
I equipped it with what I thought were FastEthernet ports, even though it shows up when I'm cabling them as 'FastEthernetx/x'. **(The equipment being HWIC-4ESW)**
The network is currently under a star-topology, so there will be no problems connecting to destination if a link goes down.
The two onboard ports of the 2911 are routed ports so assigning them an IPv4 address is perfectly possible. The HWIC ports are layer 2 ports so you will not be able to assign them an IP address. They are not routed interfaces. What you would need to do is to assign the port (or ports) to a VLAN and then create a VLAN interface in which you will be able to assign an IP address.
