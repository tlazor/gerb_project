I honestly doubt my broadband will ever be able to push out more than 54Mbps which is the theoretical maximum of a g router but I'm wondering if it's better to get a newer router even if it can't get the latest open source software. Seldom will large files be transfered across the wireless and they could always be plugged in if need be.
In the event use matters, there will potentially be between 2 and 3 computers plugged into the router and 2 laptops, 1 to 3 Android phones, and 1 iPhone connected wirelessly. The phones I believe have n but I'm unsure about the laptops.
I'm currently looking for a new router as my current one is dying and insecure. One of it's major problems is that it stopped getting updates from the manufacturer and doesn't support WPA2. Of the two routers I'm looking at, one is listed on the web site for the open source router software, Tomato, but only goes up to g. This one is made by ASUS. The other is a very well reviewed router but goes to n, is dual band, but it doesn't support open source software and is made by Cisco.
