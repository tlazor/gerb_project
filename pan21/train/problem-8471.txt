CGNAT is especially common among mobile ISPs, as the vast majority of their customers never have any reason to notice the change, and usually the ISP has at least a reserve of public addresses for the few who do need one.
(Indeed IPv4 address shortage is the reason your typical home router has to translate addresses, too â€“ but it wasn't quite as severe previously, and one public IPv4 per customer was still easily doable. Now, however, some ISPs can't even afford that.)
But second, as is unfortunately the case with more and more ISPs, your BeagleBone and modem aren't directly connected to the Internet anymore. Primarily due to IPv4 address shortage, your ISP now performs NAT on the service provider's side as well. (This is called "CGNAT", or carrier-grade NAT.) It's the exact same mechanism, but it usually shares the same public address between multiple customers.
First, the Internet is made out of routers... the distinction you're looking for is "not behind a router that does NAT". A home gateway router performs address translation, the service provider's routers usually don't.
