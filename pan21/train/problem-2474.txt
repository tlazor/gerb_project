ZFS on Linux with deduplication may be your friend in this case. There are Red Hat RPMs/repos available for installation. 
This can be chained - you can create a rdiff from old.qcow2 to evenolder.qcow2 and so on. This is rather slow but very space efficient - I generally don't ever need to delete old backups using this. There's also a rdiff-backup program, which automates similar scheme for whole directories.
At this point you can access original file by mounting LVM snapshot. Also the latest version of the large file will be available. You can create multiple snapshots this way.
Even without dedupe, if you can work this into the ZFS snapshotting workflow, there are some significant advantages to attempting this with ZFS.
Can you explain a bit more about how you wish to work with these files? Are you seeking point-in-time snapshots, or copying multiple revisions of the same/similar files to the datastore?
I'm using librsync for this purpose. It is available for CentOS and other RHEL clones in EPEL repository.
