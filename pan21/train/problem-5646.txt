If you want to avoid Terminal all together, you can download apps such as invisibliX to automatically toggle the visibility of hidden files. With that particular app, simply press the magnifying glass to toggle visibility.
Unfortunately, the easiest way still involves Terminal. To make files visible or hidden(respectively), type the following
Again, I suggest Text Editor for editing the file, which is located in the main user directory (Yes, that page is outdated, but it does tell you what you need to know)
The git installer created /etc/paths.d/git. You can remove the path entry by running sudo rm /etc/paths.d/git.
Then you can open the file which is in the main user directory (Yes, that page is outdated, but it does tell you what you need to know).
