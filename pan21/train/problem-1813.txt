If you're concerned about the reliability of a hard drive, try to find one that has a good track record. Sites like NewEgg.com have decent customer reviews.
Do not use a HDD dock. Those are really only useful in an office setting where an exposed hard drive is not that big of a risk. Get an enclosure instead. They're typically hardened for durability.
The same applies to the external enclosure. Pay attention to ratings and comments when choosing one.
As for how "delicate" it is, if you buy a good external you should be fine. Still shouldn't be dropping it because that could damage it but I've drop mine a few time and it's still kick'in at 100%. The only time it can be really damage is when the HDD is running, then even a little shake could damage sectors on your HDD. 
It really depends on how you want to play your movies. If you find buying discs and burning the movies and playing them like that easier, then get an internal. If you know you have devices that support usb i'd get an external that you you have the portability and the power of plug and play. You plug your external into a tv/dvd/console/laptop and just select your movie and away your off. Thats how I do, and it is very convent considering I can bring my external to a friends house for a movie night and I just brought over 100+ movies in a simple manner, rather than bring over 100+ dvds.
