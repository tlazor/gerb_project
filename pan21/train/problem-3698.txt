Ok, thanks to Cancun101 I've somewhat figured it out, just click on the mail settings (gear shaped icon just above the inbox  mail list) and > "Accounts and import" tab> then change the "send mail as" ("edit info")part from the sending account and you can change it to whatever name and as many times as you'd like.( this will change the author name in the inbox mail list, but on viewing that individual  mail it will still show the original mail address)
it would look like this- character2 notices notification (windows 10 mail client) (of delivery update email from amzon) on char1 laptop->proceeds to click on it,reads it googles it, finds out ulterior motives etc etc.
it has a shot where the character1 orders a book online (amazon etc I can fake ordering part), but there's another scene where  character2 reads the delivery update mail from amazon.com, 
I created the domain name and account name and all in AAmail, I tried sending email between accounts from within AAmail,(status pane at bottom of AAmail shows email sent and received by respective accounts, can send but cant view the mail from AAmail window) 
I tried many fake email services, php fake email scripts, ran a script with QK smtp server [but recieving providers all blocked it (live.com/gmail.com /spamhaus)]
I tried setting up localmailserver with "AA mail" (seems we can set up any domain name with it) but cant seem to get it right. 
cant send/receive email when I add these accounts to Windows 10mail client (my idea was to create two accounts, 1 as orderupdate@amazon.com and the 2nd the receiving account johnxyz@gmail.com, but i dont think I succeeded in setting up this right in windows 10 mail client
