One day you'll forget to "safely eject" first so that the OS can flush the cache to disk, then you'll unplug it and put it on another machine and utter the first words of the recently bereaved: "Where did all my files go?"
You are writing data to an external drive. Chances are that all that data will need to be written so you are not reducing the total volume of data to write to the drive. No win there.
Internal drives are fine due to NTFS being written to protect itself, all modern filesystem's are journalled and can at least recover to a "last good" state quickly. And an external drive with a modern fs could well be fine, but regularly trusting those mechanisms to save you is not a good way to work.
You might reduce the amount of time that the head is seeking across the surface of the drive as caching may allow the order to be optimised slightly, but that is going to be a tiny proportion of the drives lifespan compared to actual data write time. No real benefit there. 
Then there the fact that external drives can be unplugged by man or cat or petulant child at any second. If there was anything in the cache then that data is now lost. If you were using NTFS on the drive then what was there before is probably safe, but newly written data is at risk. With fat32 all bets are off, you could easily have trashed the entire filesystem by removing it at the wrong second.
Though the drive might feel slightly snappier, there is a reason why they disable write caching for removable drives, because write caching improves performance at the cost of data safety in the event of sudden removal or power loss.
