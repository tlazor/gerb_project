There are also lower thermal event thresholds which the BIOS or thermal control subsystem would use to control fan speed, etc.. The lower one is typically called THERM# and alerts while heating up and the higher one is ALERT# which is usually the last event the software handles. THERMTRIP# fires at an even higher temperature and is hardware only.
105°C is about right. AMD processors have a THERMTRIP# signal that is asserted when the temperature goes about that high (it can change a little based upon process variations). Intel also has something like this. THERMTRIP# tells the motherboard to shutdown immediately to avoid a damaging thermal event.
However, for graphics boards over 100°C is not totally unusual.  Quite high, but it depends on the vendor.  Also some motherboard chips (Intel North- or Southbridge) tend to run happily at 85°C.
I have a cpu that stays on in the bios until about 105 C and then shuts down. I am not sure if this is correct? Maybe the sensors are wrong. I think 105 is a bit high. I guess 80-90 would be more reasonable for an auto shutdown.
105°C for an Intel CPU is too much.  I think they begin throttling themselves when they cross 70°C, I doubt that an Intel CPU will really reach more than 90°C (shutting down before that or throttling to a near halt).
