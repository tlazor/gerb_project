One possibility: You may be attempting to make a connection to the wrong host. Have you verified, or do you know for certain, that 192.168.1.79 is the address of your new RPi? Try this: 
i successfully enabled ssh with the Pi3 but had issues with the older model (0e) Model B 512MB.  i am using image 2018-03-13-raspbian-stretch.
I used nmap to confirm port 22 was listening.  I connected the pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. The configuration confirmed SSH was enabled but it still was not allowing incoming connections.
An RPi MAC address will begin with b8:27:eb, so if there's any doubt that it's an RPi you're trying to connect to, the arp command above will help you verify that. 
As you've noticed, you'll need to pull your microSD card, and re-create the empty file named SSH. When you make your next attempt, you should run ssh in verbose mode, as that may provide useful information: 
I copied the /etc/ssh/ssh_host* files from a working pi3 to the older pi and rebooted. I can now successfully access the model B rev 2 raspberry pi using ssh.
