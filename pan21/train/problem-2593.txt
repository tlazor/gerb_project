The problem is in the captive portal connection itself. If you go to one, you cannot check for CRL or OCSP because (duh!) you are in the captive portal. Whomever provides this portal, must also poke holes in their firewall to allow you out from the captive portal to check the certificates that the https captive portal page is giving you. We had to do this on our enterprise wireless system before Lion could get anywhere.
Delete that, though I had mixed results. It only worked 1/3 times. The way that definitely works is deleting:
(YMMV but it worked for me) -- I deactivated the network, rebooted to kill the keychain problem or else it freezes the Keychain Access, no need to delete anything. Then, I deactivated the OCSP and CRL. I activated the network ... I connected to my captive portal, and then reactivated everything.
Just rinse and repeat. I'm not completely certain when the Keychain Access will break, but at some point (typically about 3 days in for me) everything stops working.
Firefox seems to get around things and if you don't want to do anything at all, you can turn off OCSP in Firefox (about:config) just to login to your wireless portal, and then remember to turn it back on. This won't fix Safari or Chrome though (what's the word on Opera?)
A suggestion at the end of https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3430739?start=0&tstart=0 seems to indicate that the following procedure fixes the issue: http://www.macworld.com/article/163227/2011/10/fix_a_lion_file_opening_hang_in_mac_os_x_10_7_2.html
But the best solution is to restore to 10.7.1 or 10.7. I happened to have the DMG file from earlier and it was 10.7.1. Doing a "reinstall" only copies your Lion system files over and keeps your entire install in shape. So you're really just reinstalling the OS but keeping ALL your apps and data. So far this has been perfect. Just remember not to update to 10.7.2 if you're going to roll back.
Problem is the captive portal requires a certificates, but blocks the certificate chain. Thank you for the other one suggesting this.
Turning Off OCSP and CRL checks is avery bad idea. Essentially you are saying you don't care about certificate revocation. This is not good given the number of certificate authorities getting hacked these days. It is why apple upgraded it's security for captive portals.
Might I add that MobileMe is now iCloud so the folder is not Application Support/Mobi*, but rather Application Support/Ubiquity.
