I'm trying to get access to their Plesk panel now and it will be fixed by simply adding the A record once again. 
So I was checking my DNS config in their old panel, which showed that everything was fine, while it wasn't. 
The first command mforsetti gave in his answer also confirms this: the sub.domain-b.org was pointing to a server of the hosting provider. I never thought of doing a DNS lookup because I was convinced I was having the DNS records right in front of me in their old panel.
Firefox has warned that pages with mixed content (HTTP and HTTPS) are untrusted for some time and on some platforms is now not displaying pages unless you accept the risk. Check that your sites are not showing mixed content which you can do by looking at the page source or loading the page in Developer Tools (F12). You can also check the status of the certificate by clicking on the 'i' icon next to the padlock in the location field in both Chrome and Firefox. 
I contacted the hosting provider of domain-b.org since I couldn't find any problems on my server side. Luckily they answered quickly and told me they recently migrated their control panel from an old system to Plesk. For some reason they couldn't tell me, they did not migrate any subdomains.
