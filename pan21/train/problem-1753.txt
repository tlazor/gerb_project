I did not want to logout or restart and attempting to launch explorer via new task was not working despite all processes being terminated. The solution for me was to browse to the Windows Directory (C:\Windows) and right click on explorer.exe - run as administrator. ;)
The answer was to simply delete the extraneous period at the end of the path and start explorer again.  Solved.  Such a nice fix.  I wonder how it ever got messed up in the first place.  MalwareBytes did detect 50+ objects, however, which may have had something to do with it.
I had the same problem, and thanks to the answer by Jens Erat, I was able to find another solution!  I've been repairing computers for years and have not seen this problem.  Unfortunately, Jens' answer was not what did it for me, but while I was in that part of the registry, I saw a problem with the userinit key.  The key had "c:\windows\system32\Userinit.exe."
Press Ctrl + Shift + ESC. Go into Processes and stop Explorer.exe, as you already described. Then go to Applications --> New Task, type in explorer and press Enter.
