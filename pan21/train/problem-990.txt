Now, as something is broken in your server, it's hard to tell if this will solve your case. And of course, a downside to this is you won't know about any possibly necessary update, later.
What I am looking for is to find the source of this information that tells apt-get that mysql server needs its attention. I would like to manually edit that source of information and tell apt-get that this package is all OK and it should not care about it anymore.
If it is not possible to change that apt-get status about a package, would it be possible to somehow tell apt-get not to care about mysql server at all (i.e. to somehow exclude mysql server package from apt-get completely).
I have a broken Ubuntu 14.04 server. Everything is OK except for apt-get, which for some reason thinks that it repeatedly fails to update mysql server package. The mysql server is updated and works perfectly, so I do not want apt-get to touch it. But every time I do anything that includes apt-get update and apt-get install (including installing completely unrelated packages), it always tries to finish the installation of mysql server.
Please note that I am not very interested in actually making apt-get to finish the mysql server update. This is because mysql server runs in production there and everytime apt-get tries to "fix it", it kills it and corrupts the database.
