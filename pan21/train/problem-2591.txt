Make sure you also delete your deleted items. You can login to webmail and see what the server currently has, optionally deleting the mails there. Make sure your outlook syncs too.

You could use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to configure deleted item retention for the mailbox, and purge the items in the recoverable Items folder. After that, check the mailbox storage again.
Emails have been deleted locally but if I check the file size of the folders in my inbox Local data is a few megabytes but server data is many gigabytes. How do remove the emails from the server?
In Exchange Server, when a user deletes items from the Deleted Items default folder, the items are moved to the Recoverable Items\Deletions folder. The duration that deleted items remain in this folder is based on the deleted item retention settings configured for the mailbox database or the mailbox. By default, a mailbox database is configured to retain deleted items for 14 days, and the recoverable items warning quota and recoverable items quota are set to 20 gigabytes (GB) and 30 GB respectively.
