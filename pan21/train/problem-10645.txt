Interestingly I can connect through telnet to the remote server via the port that sql server is listening on. In the SQL Server logs I can see the connection attempt. So SQL Server is up and running and listening on the correct port - no firewall blocking it.
Are you saying that in the SQL Server error log you are seeing the connection attempt by Management Studio?  If so, what does the log say about why the connection couldn't be established (it might differ from what SSMS tells you, since if the log is recording the message on the server side, obviously the server could be found)?  Are you using a server name, if so have you tried using the IP address instead?  And are you 100% certain that SQL Server is in fact listening on port 1433?  And also that it is not a named instance?  For a named instance you would need to connect to [server name or IP][instance name].
Anyone got any ideas? Server is set to allow remote connections - TCP IP is enabled, firewall is off.
I am in the process of trying to configure SQL Server 2008 to accept remote connections. I have been through all the documentation I can find and yet when I attempt to connect through management studio I get an error stating that the server could not be found.
We had this a couple months ago with our SQL Server 2008 box.  The root cause was an issue with the domain account that was binded the SQL server service, somebody changed the password.  Try this before attempting the dreaded reboot.
It would appear that by default SQL Server is listening on port 50314 by default but management studio attempts to connect on port 1433.Weird.
We are seeing the connection attempt when we telnet in on port 50314 in the sql server logs. When we login through management studio we see it attempting connection on port 1433. There is no sign of this connection attempt in the logs.
