When you generate the certificate request using Web Enrollment the private key is generated locally using your browser.  The certificate signing request is sent to the CA (without the private key) at which point it is signed.  The certificate is then presented to you on the webpage with a link to 'Install This Certificate'.
When you 'Install This Certificate' it is saved to your certificate store, at which point it is married up with the private key.  If you were to open the Certificates MMC you'd see this certificate there and it would show that you also have the private key.  It is only at this point that you can export both as a PKCS#12 file.
You can carry out a similar procedure on the command line, but again, you'll need to install the certificate before you can export as a PKCS#12.
At that point in time, you cannot possibly save that as a PKCS#12 (ignoring the fact that you can't right click and select 'Save As') as it is simply a certificate on the server.
So, I suppose the answer to your question will be 'No, you can not. The private key is always local and has to be married up with the certificate returned from the CA before you can export as a PKCS#12.'
Alternatively, you can use the Certificates MMC to request a certificate and later export it with its private key as a PKCS#12, but even this way the certificate is installed on your computer first (in order to marry it up with its private key) before you can export it.
