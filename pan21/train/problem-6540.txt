I heart IrfanView. Although for Gnome, I use gthumb as my Linux equivalent. It doesn't have the myriad of swiss-tools that IV has, but quality scaling, cropping and color adjustment suits me well enough. I do love how gthumb imports photos from my camera :D
As a Kubuntu user, I've stuck with the default image viewer for KDE - Gwenview. It's sufficient for everyday operations and I believe you can even extend it with plugins.
But unfortunately IrfanView is for Windows only, and isn't free software. What would be the nearest equivalent for linux?
I don't know a single solution unfortunately, I ended up using kuickshow for viewing (its the fastest viewer I have seen so far) and the most basic operations, and GIMP for everything else.
For me, the key features are fast viewing, simple editing (crop, contrast, brigthness, rotation, resampling), file operations (delete, copy to folder) and extended image information access (exif data) combined in the same interface. Versatile batch jobs are a very nice bonus.
