There are also external monitoring services. I can recommend Monitor.us. The base functionality is free (updates every 30 min, service checking (HTTP, SMTP etc.) and also CPU/Mem/Processes etc. by installing an agent software).
Everything depends on what you want. For example Munin is very simple, you can install and configure it in less then 10 minutes (on one server), it can sends alarms, make graphs from monitoring cpu, mem. apache connections, eaccellerator, disk io and many many more (it has many plugins). But if you are planning in future get some more machines, munin may not be enough. For example in munin you cant monitor state of individual processes, can't monitor changes in files (for security purpose). So if you wanna only see what is the utilization of basics parameters on your server and don't plan to buy some more servers Munin is what you are looking for, but if you wanna be alarmed when some of your service is down, take more control on what is happeninig on your server (servers) then you should consider installing Nagios (or even Zabbix which is great for monitoring whole bunch of servers :D )
If you want more, e.g. full page load monitoring, other (shorter) intervals, more testing locations or a log parser, you need to upgrade.

Try out google there is much more info and many tutorials how to install and configure monitoring solutions.
Munin is great for just monitoring and historical graphs. You can run it just on a single host, or connect more hosts later. Takes very little time to set up aswell.
