This is commonly done under Linux and well baked into most distros - the technology is called "Channel Bonding" - bridging means something different (more-or-less making your device act as a switch).
The official solution to what you are trying to do in Linux is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBonding 
Of specific note the "bond-mode" defines the way balancing works - there are 6 modes which define different behaviours for different scenarios and it is important to get the correct one for your needs. Some modes will work with all hardware - like balance-rr, some will require special switches.  (I selected balance-rr as it shuffles traffic out alternative interfaces if both interfaces are available.   Its probably not a great choice for balancing inbound traffic)
In summary nutshell you install "ifenslave" to bind the interfaces together, install the "bonding" kernel module and modify your interfaces so that your ethernet devices become slaves, and a new "bond0" device is created - a very simplified interfaces file might look
