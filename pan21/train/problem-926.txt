"Each receive DMA channel of a NIC can generate one interrupt, and each interrupt will target one CPU. Sun Multi-threaded 10GbE has 8 receive DMA channels per port, and Quad GbE has 4, so their interrupts can target at most 8 and 4 different CPU, respectively. To avoid interrupt CPU becoming the performance bottleneck, it is recommended to start with a value of the number of receive DMA channels per port or (# of CPU), whichever is lower, so that interrupt loads are distributed to enough CPU."
"edge" and "level" refer to edge vs level triggering, which is a difference very much in the hardware domain. The distinction only makes sense when talking about the 4 physical interrupt lines of a parallel PCI bus, unless it is a software emulation of such behaviour or on the parallel bus segment behind a PCIe-PCI bridge (which is sometimes used WITHIN extension boards).
IIRC PC can have any number of MSI interrupts. But each device is limited to 32 (for PCI 2.2) or 2048 (for PCI 3.0) MSI interrupts.
