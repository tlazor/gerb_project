It was working fine with php-5.1.6-27.el5 and mysql 5.0 version. After MySQL upgrade, certain PHP pages had issues and I had to upgrade to PHP 5.3 But it did not resolve the issue.
If everything that you have installed for php is available in the php53 version uninstall what you have and then reinstall the new versions.   
You will need to remove your existing php stuff before adding the new version. I have had some problems with not everything being avalible for php53 so do a quick check of what is installed first. Then compare that to what is avalible. 
As a system administrator I would be MUCH more comfortable with these versions. Although I must admit they lack some of the plugins such as APC. 
Using repositories such as webtactic should be a last resort. They normally are run by one person and even assuming that there are no other problems with the package if that person gets busy with other tasks you can easily be vulnerable to an attack that is unpatched. CentOS/RHEL 5.6 added php53 as an official package along side the existing php version.
