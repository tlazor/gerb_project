It is possible to eliminate the dedicated eth1 link between them, but since you have a DB connection (presumably between server1 and server2), there shouldn't be a need for that traffic to cross your corporate LAN... besides you'll get a tiny bit more reliability with a crossover cable and no intermediate device to fail.
I assume your office network is not in the 64.34.44.72/29 block.  If I am correct, re-address eth0 on each machine with a static address that your office network admin assigns; connect eth0 of each machine to your office network.  The reason I say static is because these machines provide business services to your network; they need to be mapped in DNS, and also need a constant address you can manage them from.
Some offices get complicated by assigning all addrs via DHCP, and resolve names w/ dynamic dns... if that works in your office, then great... no need for statics on eth0.
Run a dedicated link between server1:eth1 and server2:eth1.  This will be for your DB connection between the boxes.
If your bug-tracker is not on server1, reconfigure the bug tracker to connect to whatever address you assign to server2:eth0, and be sure that your DB server is listening on server2:eth0.
