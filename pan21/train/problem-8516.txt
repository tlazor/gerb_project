Each LAN continues to work with its own broadband connection, but now there is a direct route between the LANs to access each other's private IP address ranges. IF one broadband connection goes down, this will not permit one LAN to access the Internet through the other LAN's broadband connection.
Chances are the DHCP server on the to be 192.168.3.0 WiFi LAN can't be configured to serve out custom routes, so the route to get to the router that's connecting the two LANs will have to be manually added on each host.
If you can configure the Mikrotik to be the router that connects the two LANs, then you don't have to add routes to all the hosts on the 192.168.2.0/24 LAN. But all the hosts on the 192.168.3.0/24 LAN will need to have the Mikrotik added as a gateway to get to 192.168.2.0/24.
I suggest changing one of the networks to a different segment, such as changing the Wi-Fi LAN to 192.168.3.0/24, since currently both are on 192.168.2.0/24. Then you can configure a router to be a gateway between the two different LANs. For the 192.168.2.0/24 LAN, some host that is on 192.168.2.0/24 will have to also be connected to 192.168.3.0/24. Say that host is connected to both LANs with the addresses 192.168.2.2 and 192.168.3.2. Every host on 192.168.2.0/24 will have to have 192.168.2.2 added to its routing table as the gateway to get to 192.168.3.0/24, and every host on 192.168.3.0/24 will have to have the same thing done the the other way around so that 192.168.3.2 is the gateway for 192.168.2.0/24. If you just add the routes to the existing routers instead of each host, then all traffic will go to the router and the back out again on to the LAN to the router that's connecting the two segments.
