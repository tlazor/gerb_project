My final suggestion. Don't use an if/else statement if you can get away with just using the if. Your if statement returns early, therefore the else statement is implied. There is no need to explicitly use an else statement and force yourself to indent your code unnecessarily. This will help you to avoid the Arrow Anti-Pattern.
You should use is_file() instead of file_exists(). The difference is that the latter doesn't assume its parameter is an actual file and will also return TRUE for directories. However, neither is actually necessary in this context. is_readable() also checks if a file exists, so this is redundant and unnecessary. Just use is_readable().
Depending on the size of these files, imploding the input into an array and iterating over that will allow you to download multiple files, though at this point you will want to offer links to said files instead of automatically generating a save file dialog.
I would never directly use user input. Always sanitize and validate it. You've already validated, you just need to sanitize. An easy way to do this if your PHP version is >= 5.2 is to use filter_input().
