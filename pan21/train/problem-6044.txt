But even after they have all been killed, OOM still triggers and looks for someone else to sacrifice. It gets to the java processes started by my make command. It killed them one by one:
I described my issue on odroidx forum, but I fear it to be an environment issue. That's why I push a question in here. I have been building android from source with this computer for 6 months and never experienced such memory issues. In case it is useful, I use sun-java6:
It's not abnormal. I had this discussion before with someone building custom Android distros. You will need a lot more memory than 8 GB. IIRC they used a 32 GB ram machine.
I build Android-4.0.4 for odroid-x on a lenovo x220 core i7 8GB of RAM running Linux Mint 12 (Ubuntu-11.10). I start 5 jobs to build, and after a while OOM triggers and kills dozen of processes until it kills the java processes started by my build, and feels happy with it. By happy, I mean Linux does not trigger OOM afterward. I have uploaded my dmesg after the process slaughter finished. First OOM kills my chrome tabs, but they are innocent since OOM still triggers after they've all been killed.
