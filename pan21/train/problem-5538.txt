Have you tried disabling the web and telnet configuration interfaces and only using ssh, by turning off the webserver on the router you might be able to reduce load. At my current job we have a similar setup for wireless users (ddwrt is only on ap, but not net gw).  I haven't tried turning off the web UI but it might help out.
If no, connect the other machines one at a time (or in small groups) and see if you can narrow things down to a specific machine.
You might be able to use that system as a web proxy (squid is your friend) to help alleviate some of the load on your poor little router...
This could be any number of things.  Break down the issue into smaller parts and start isolating the issue.
First try doing the unplug then replugging of systems to see if there's a "tipping point". Second, I'd put in a system somewhere with two NIC's...running Linux...and route traffic through it transparently as a proxy. Maybe you can see if that will give you some insight on traffic load as well...unusual traffic may be a sign of malware activity that is also killing your connection.
Those SRW2048 switches tend to have failed capacitors. Ours kept dropping from Gb to 100Mb on the majority of ports because of it (odd, I know). Try a better switch if you can get a loaner for testing. 
I first suspect that you're overloading the unit. 50 machines is a lot for a consumer based piece of hardware to handle, and you don't know if systems on your network aren't streaming data or possibly are infected with something that is flooding the routing table on the router.
I think the only thing you can do is try first unplugging most of the machines and see how it handles routing traffic for a few systems at first, then scale it up gradually to see where your load is peaking.
