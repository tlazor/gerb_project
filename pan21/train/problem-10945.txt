The original IP=PSPACE proof works by producing an interactive proof for QBF. A restricted case of QBF, $\mbox{QBF}_k$ is complete for $\Sigma^P_k$. The same arithmetization strategy will work equally well for $\mbox{QBF}_k$. The computationally difficult part of the provers strategy would seem to be reducing the degree of the polynomials involved and evaluating the QBF formulae arising. It seems likely that this can be achieved using an oracle for the corresponding level of the polynomial hierarchy ($\Sigma^P_k$), by redoing the arithmitization in each round, once the verifier has provided their random choices.
Even for giving an IP for coNP, using current techniques, one needs to arithmetize, i.e. use counting, which means essentially the full power of #P.  Any weaker prover even for coNP would be very interesting, I think (in particular would imply a new non relativing technique.)
Yes, the question of whether coNP has an interactive proof where the prover is weaker than #P (say, polytime with access to NP oracle) is a well known open question.
Avi Wigderson and I mentioned the problem in our algebrization paper, where we raised the question of whether or not containments such as coNP âŠ† IPNP can be proved via algebrizing techniques. (Here IPNP denotes IP with a BPP verifier and a BPPNP prover.)  If (as I conjecture) the answer is no, then that would provide a formal reason why any interactive protocol like the one Peter asks for would require non-relativizing techniques that go "fundamentally beyond" the ones used for IP=PSPACE.
Since Suresh has suggested I post my comment as an answer, I will. However, I do not consider this to constitute a full answer as I have not attempted to prove this, and it may turn out to be a dead end.
An analogous question is whether or not BQP = IPBQP, where IPBQP means IP with a BPP verifier and a BQP (quantum polynomial-time) prover.  That question is also open---although a recent breakthrough by Broadbent, Fitzsimons, and Kashefi showed that a closely-related statement is true.
The following recent paper of Haitner, Mahmoody and Xiao discusses this question and shows some consequences of the assumption that this cannot be done.
