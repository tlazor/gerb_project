So, from the performance point of view - nothing changes to the worse when using D2700, also, you are getting more availability.
You'll want to keep the arrays in the external enclosure separate from those inside the server. Just from a fault-domain perspective.
However, you can have boot disks in the enclosure or have the server itself be empty. Up to you. The D2700 enclosure is a rock-solid unit, so the advantage when using SAS disks is dual-porting/dual-pathing, depending on which host RAID controller you're using.
D2700 provides four physical interfaces per SFF port, each 6gb/s, which gives total 24gb/s per one physical port. In multipath configuration it can provide up to 48gb/s when using two HP HBA's and two storage controllers.
Remember that a single (spinning) disk's throughput won't approach 6Gbps, so oversubscription is fine in this case.
Your SAS connections are multi-lane 6Gbps links on a SFF-8088 connection. That's 24Gbps. You'll probably be doing this with one controller.
