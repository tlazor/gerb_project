I've used testdisk to recover data from corrupted usb drives before under both windows and linux but that does rely on the drive being successfully detected by the OS even if it's not showing as formatted.  No guarantees but it is worth a try.
My wife has a Western Digital My Passport Essentials USB 3.0 HDD (P/N: WDBACY5000ABL - 00) which has started to behave quite flaky lately.  Particularly, it's registering as unformatted despite currently having (to my knowledge, but not showing in the OS) 40+ GB stored on it.
I know that there are tools to perform hardware tests on SATA/IDE drives, but I'm also aware that many USB drives are hard-wired to the USB controller in their enclosure.  Are there any utilities that can do diagnostics on these sorts of drives?  I've tried checking WD's website, and haven't found any - though it's always possible I just haven't looked in the right places yet.
I've tried using a forensic data recovery tool to pull data from the drive, but very few files were actually found and none seem to have been recovered intact.  I'm wondering if there might be some sort of hardware failure involved here.
I would remove the drive from the enclosure, if the usb chip in the enclosure is defective, then no tool will help, you must remove the drive from the faulty enclosure, use another hard drive to usb adapter to attempt recovery of your data.
Check that there isn't a USB problem such as a corrupt driver - does the problem drive work on a different computer running a different operating system?
