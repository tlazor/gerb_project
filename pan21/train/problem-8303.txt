On the process network side, we would like to be able to print on the business network printers, however, I am stumped as to how I would do this.
In case of a network printer, it should already listen on port 9100 which is ment for "raw" printing, you can just open this port on the firewall and add the printer to your print server like any other network printer.
I should mention, that the business and process network each operate on their own domains and are separated by a firewall. 
You could add the IP address of the firewall in your process network to the allowed list on your business firewall.  This will allow access to your business network from your process network going externally.
At my workplace, we have two fiber networks setup, one for the business network and the other for process control (industrial manufacturing). On the business network, there is a standard print server that all computers on the business network can access. 
Additionally, depending on the actual physical location of the two firewalls and the availability of open ports on your devices you could pair the two devices to allow traffic to pass between the two firewalls without having to go over the network.  Without knowing specifics of what hardware you are running for your firewalls I cannot try to locate a guide on how to implement these possible solutions.
