I don't think AVI is generally considered to have much of a future, so I doubt anyone will be adding support for that container format.
It's possible to play MP4 and possibly MKV using the HTML <video> element, although you haven't explained your setup, so it's hard to say whether this will work for you.
Firefox brower can handle and stream flv files with help of Adobe Flash Player,it is well known to us.But can we play MP4,AVI,MKV file on Firefox without downloading?
on the sub-feature tab are listened supported video/audio formats and their support matrix across the browsers.
As an example, you can simply drag an MP4 video into a Firefox tab, and it will play (assuming H.264 video and AAC audio, anyway). I don't have an MKV file handy at the moment, but that might work too (on Chrome, I've successfully played both MP4 and MKV by dragging the file into a tab). I'm not sure any browser vendor is officially supporting the MKV container, though; it may only work as a by-product of supporting WebM.
Yes, it's possible to play video (mkv, mp4, ogg, etc) with the modern browser without a plugin. You can do that with using "video" tag.
