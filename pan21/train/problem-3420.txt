I'm wondering if your network shares are up to the performance impact of lots of users Docs directories?  Do you have a good enterprise network administrator who can make sure your switching and routing  design is solid?  I've seen school labs  with 60 machines, filled with students trying watch youtube, on a 10/100 uplink to the core network.
Deep Freeze certainly sounds  like it could have performance implications, I'm wondering if  MS Steady State is better?
With the new GPO available with Windows 7, the GPP ( group policy preference ) you can set settings as default for a user and the give them the choice to change it. You can push printer  and set it by default, check it as run-once and this policy will only apply one time, giving the end user possibility to change his default printer.
You can access GPP from any GPO from a windows 7 and windows server 2008 r2. Most of GPP can work on Windows XP if you have Client side extension installed ( available on Windows update)  
I'm curious about this one as  I do consulting for a school and have settled on group policy.  Group Policy with Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 clients can manage  the settings you mention, if login times are long it is possibly due to network or  server performance issues that can be fixed with good netork and server design.
I've found a few things  to get this to work faster. One is to create a powershell script that replicates changes between logon servers on command.  The other is to create a script that forces a  remote gpupdate /force on machines.  So you make your changes, run the replication script, then run the gpudate script. Then the user does  a restart or log off (depending on  the settings, some take restart or two).
