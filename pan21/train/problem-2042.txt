SysTracer is a system utility tool that can scan and analyze your computer to find changed (added, modified or deleted) data into registry and files.
There will be a lot of information presented, but you can filter by application (you'll need to know the application being run during install which might be something like setup.exe or msiexec).
I would like to know if there is a way to detect which registry settings an installer affects. Are there other options than running a full-size VM and then somehow comparing snapshots of the registry hives? If these is the best approach, please share your experiences. 
The objective here is to figure out where in the registry a certain program stores settings. During installation and otherwise. It might seem like a good idea to just ask the developers, but I've faced this situation before (not knowing where in the registry a program stores settings) and would like to find a general approach to this problem. 
You could try running Process Explorer (a free tool from Microsoft), which you could use to show you all the files and keys being accessed during the installation.
