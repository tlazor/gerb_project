The harsh reality about computer security is as much as you want to prevent unwanted access, being obsessed with blocking access is not as important as:
You’re asking if make should be installed on a production server, but my real question would be: Who has access to that production server & what safeguards do you have in place to deal with an incursion? If make was not installed but someone gain root access, guess what? They can manually install make and anything they want.
There is nothing inherently insecure in them, they do not make your machine more insecure than one where you have bash + cat + shell redirection.
A compiler like gcc is a powerful awk configured with a set of substitutions that standard awk does not support. It is a non-POSIX-compliant sort or cat that injects rubbish in the output. It is an interactive text editor (think vi) which is configured to do some editing on startup, then exit before displaying the user interface.
This is all dependent on what kind of work you do. I work primarily in the web server world & my attitude is basically, anyone getting production server access from me needs to prove skills, knowledge & maturity. That’s it. Sometimes it takes a few days. Sometimes it takes months. But basically, your best line of security on production servers is controlling access on top of the sundry other things we do to harden servers.
