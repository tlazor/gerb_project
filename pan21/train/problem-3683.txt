Don't forget to restart your Terminal after doing everything. If your system still seems borked, consider backing up your documents and maybe some settings from ~/Library and starting fresh.
So I am wondering, short of wiping and reinstalling everything on my computer, is there  a way to "reset" my slate? Or how would I best go about uninstalling every program I have installed, including things like NPM packages, nuking my .dotfiles and cleaning my PATH so that I may begin again, as it were, with more knowledge and forethought?
Assuming you installed Homebrew, and most of the dependencies through it (like Node.js and Git), you need to uninstall Homebrew first, according to this Gist.
My problem is I have messed things up to the point I am at a loss how to recover, and trying to run programs like Yeoman and Grunt I can not get to work. Commands are never found, I think it has to do partially with my $PATH being really messed up, the output is a mess, this is from echo $PATH
Running OS X 10.8.3, I have installed a mess of stuff; Ruby, RVM, Git, Node, Brew etc... As well as playing with dotfiles (http://dotfiles.github.io/) Which I really should have learned more about first.
