My preference would be a big-name commercially-supported one, so they have the resources and person hours to stay on top of the most threats, but if anyone has tried both ClamAV and one or more commercial ones and thinks ClamAV is better (or has other reason to say ClamAV is better), I'd definitely be interested to know.
Does anyone have experience running anti-virus software on a Linux web server, especially CentOS, and what do you recommend?  I'm interested in putting it on a web server we have as one more method for detecting and preventing website compromises (more so than a whole server compromise, though that would be nice as well).  While ideally all websites would have perfect security, it would be nice to have one more security measure in place since things are rarely perfect.
In the past I've seen Kaspersky catch malicious JavaScript files when it's running on Windows machines which leads me towards it since they have a Linux offering which supports CentOS, but if there's something better I'd be interested too or if anyone has bad experiences with it, please do share.
