It's difficult to know what else is wrong without full configs, but I would be really careful, considering the current config, and what can happen with those redistribution commands ;)
Likewise the 199.192.100.2/28 should probably not be on that bond0 device. Try putting it on the lo interface and tell that interface to be a passive interface.
Also I would recommend setting the OSPF interface mode between MX80 and Quagga to point-to-point. This will speed up convergence time.
The network statement tells Quagga on which interface to enable OSPF. Every interface that has an IP from that subnet will have OSPF enabled.
Your /30 range that the OSPF neighbors are partially trying to form an adjacency on falls outside the /28 that is enabled for OSPF... which is where the subnet mask mismatch is coming from.  The debug output tells you everything you need to know to fix it.  OSPF rcvd Hello should match the other side.  IF the masks don't match, an adjacency will never form.
The problem is that you have the wrong subnet configured in OSPF in Quagga. You need the /30 as network statement:
I know this is a little late, but for clarification, several things must match for OSPF to form neighbor relationships. These include area number, interface type (point to point or broadcast) hello timers, dead timers and subnet mask of the interfaces that are forming neighbors. The MX is looking for it's neighbor to be on the exact same subnet mask as the local MX interface. 
You would be much better off having distinct connections between the MX80 + Quagga routers, or at least a network segment dedicated to OSPF between the three (although in this case, you'd need to have interface-type p2p turned off, because you'd want a DR election.  The reason you had this issue in the first place was that Quagga was trying to establish an OSPF adjacency with Hello packets from the wrong subnet/configured IP.
