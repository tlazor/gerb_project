Now, all best practice guides out there tell me that having a second AD domain controller (a "backup DC") is highly recommended.
In your situation AD requires very little resources, so something with 4GB of RAM and a 120GB SATA HDD would work.  I'd like to see 2 cores at a minimum.  Maybe look for a used server on an auction site.
I don't like the idea.  On the workstation, you would be running some kind of free Hypervisor with Server 20xx and the AD role.  
You must own a unique Windows Server 20xx license that you would install on that machine and if you are going that far, I'd recommend buing a dedicated machine or scavenging up something.  
Putting it on the same physical machine as the primary DC seems pretty pointless, so I thought of putting it as a VM on one of the stronger workstations which usually runs 24-7 anyways. Since it's just a backup DC, I'd give it very little CPU/RAM resources, so it should not affect the user too much.
As a small shop (~10 PCs), we have only one physical server machine. This physical server machine runs the following two virtual machines:
It is  recommend to run DC on physical server not in virtual host. You can keep ADC on virtual host 
In case of any issues or required restart on vm host server. Might be get issues with domain authentication
