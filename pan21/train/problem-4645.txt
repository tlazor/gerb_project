The example is very contrived, yet background is that I want to only export a sub fraction from a larger csv without having to cherry-pick via sed or using
I will use the smaller file for setting up a unit test, which is why I don't want to change the format of the csv file even if it most likely wouldn't make much of a different given a proper csv parser.
As the point of the unit test is to make sure it parses the actual format properly, and I don't want to test against LibreOffice's understanding of a CSV file.
If I open this one with Libre Office with these settings, I can view it nicely. Yet if I select the entire document again and copy it, the clipboard contains:
I like to use LibreOffice Calc as it offers a nice filter feature through Data > Autofilter making it easy to find the lines I want to use. Yet extracting that selection is not as straightforward.
This is slightly different formatting from the original.  If it needs to be exactly the same, then LO Calc is not the right tool.  Use sed or similar.
