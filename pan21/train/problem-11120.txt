There's always a chance for issues with raid-controllers... in that without an OS and drivers, there is no way to access the disks.  Sometimes, (on good controllers anyway) the raid-controller will operate in some sort of simple-mode until the drivers are loaded, and then you will be able to use the full feature-set of the raid controller.   If this is the case, you can use almost any bootable disk tools to do almost anything to the disks.
I highly recommend looking at GRC's spinRite as it's probably the best tool for doing surface scans & recovery.  It's completely OS agnostic, so it doesn't matter if you're using windows or linux or whatever flavor of OS/file-system/whatever on that disk.  They have ISO bootable images as well as thumb-drive based images you can use to boot directly into the tool without an existing OS on the machine as well.
Have you tried using the PowerEdge diagnostics from Dell? These are usually accessible from the POST screen, and can also be downloaded as a CD image from Dell's support site (double-check the version and its compatibility with your server).
