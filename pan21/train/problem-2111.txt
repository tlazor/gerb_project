May seem basic but I have seen plenty of bread-n-butter shops where folks don't think they have a need for this kind of system administration.  Plenty of places spend big $$$ on big sets of administrative tools and, as far as I can tell, 95% of what they use the tools for could have been done with a few hours of scripting if anybody knew that or knew how to do it.
I am a programmer and senior admin/integrator. To work where I do, you need to know the following things:
Knowing how to bind to your LDAP and retrieve needed info in your scripting language of choice is key for everything from troubleshooting to really stepping up various types of automation (account and resource provisioning, more intelligent checks on user or machine accounts).
I've found that knowing bash, dos batch, and powershell scripting provide a system admin with the framework to do just about anything, on any popular system.
Most of the junior admins can look at one of our programmers and say (with authority), yes, I installed it correctly, here's where you have a leak which is why the code you just pushed is breaking. Or "No, its not our version of MySQL, look at your query here ..."
Scripting is essential, but I'd second the advice that knowing some "real" languages is a definite bonus.  You can do some very useful things with the .NET System.DirectoryServices namespace, for example.
I think we're kind of different, when we hire a gifted administrator .. we half way expect for them to (eventually) find their way to programming, even if its just hacking something we use to work the way they need it to work.
