I am aware that my solution is quite unorthodox for JavaScript; it can probably be seen that I come from a Java background. As such, I would also appreciate any comments on how to make the solution more "JS-like". I should also mention that the algorithm was not important in the task, so it doesn't need to be reviewed.
As part of an job interview process, I was tasked to write a solver for a simplified Tetris game using JavaScript. The game board size is 4x4 and there are 4 different pieces given in a .txt file. It is not allowed to rotate the pieces, so they should be placed exactly as they are specified in the file. Following normal Tetris rules, a row is cleared when there are no empty squares on a row. The goal is to have as few pieces on the board as possible after having placed all of them.
I am not arguing against the feedback that I got, but what bothers me is even with this feedback, I do not know how I should improve my code. Therefore I am asking for a code review, specifically with readability and architecture in mind. 
Unfortunately I did not pass the assignment, so I asked for feedback on my implementation. According to them, the biggest problem with my code was that the solution was too complex for the task and that the code was hard to read. They also said that my prints were not working and that I overused the letstatement.
