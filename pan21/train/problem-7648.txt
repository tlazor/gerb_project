1.Make a boot AV disc then boot from the disc and scan the hard drive, remove any infections it finds, I like the KAspersky disc myself.
Install free MBAM, run the program and go to the Update tab and update it, then go to the Scanner Tab and do a quick scan, select and remove anything it finds.
These last 2 are not AV softwares like Norton, they are on demand scanners that only scan for nasties when you run the program and will not interfere with Norton, these can be run once a week to ensure you are not infected. Be sure you update them before each weekly scan.
Very often it is fastest to just save all your data (songs, pictures, documents, etc.) and re-install Windows and all of your programs.  This approach has multiple benefits.  It is likely to be just as fast as tracking down and eliminating the virus, it will eliminate any other viruses that you might not even know you have, and it makes your entire system fresh and clean.
I would recommend never trying to remove a virus, just reformat and reinstall your OS. If you partition your disk when you install it to keep the OS on one partition, and your home folder on another, then this becomes super easy and you don't lose anything.
3.When MBAM is done install SAS free version, run a quick scan, remove what it automatically selects.
Check the network settings in your browsers are correct, for example, I.E. is normally set to automatically detect settings
