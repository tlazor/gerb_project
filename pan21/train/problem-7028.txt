If there many files that match this file mask, then you will down-load an increasing number of files on each access. A quick and dirty fix is to keep the files in your current directory and make them read-only: you will get a lot of errors, but the new file will down-load and you won't have the overhead of transferring the files you have got previously.
If I understand you correctly, there is a new file each time you access the server, but you don't know the details of its name. What I don't know is whether the file is removed after you down-load it, or whether you have an ever-increasing number of files and you have to choose the latest.
If you can't do any of these things, then you will need two ftp calls: the first will get a directory list from the remote, which you will then compare with your previous remote list, so that you can then identify the new file and build a second ftp call to retrieve it. A batch file to do this will not be easy to write, but it's possible - I do things like this when I am processing WebCam files.
In the simplest case, there is only one file, and here your solution is almost correct: there is one simple change needed, to replace get by mget, when the wild card * will work:-
If you have full access to the remote directory, then you can delete, move or rename the down-loaded file on the remote, so that you will have only one file each time which matches the file mask.
