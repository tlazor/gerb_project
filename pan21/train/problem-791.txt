Depending on your retention period, you should have an automatic cleanup job to clear out the old backup files. All these can be created using SQL maintenance plans. Check this link out for SQL 2005.
I wouldn't do a full backup every night.  If it is a large database then that could take a very long time, not to mention take up a lot of space on the media.  Do a full backup every weekend and a differential backup every night.  Then do a transaction log backup (assuming your database is in full recovery) every hour, or every half hour, but ensure these .bak and .trn files reside on a separate disk in case of disk failure.
You should store your backups on some form of redundant disk (mirrored), or you can use tapes for offsite storage. Users can continue to work on the system while the backups run.
Lets say your have a common business scenario with your busiest time being: 9am-5pm Monday-Friday. Then I would suggest: Full backup at Sunday night. Differential backups at 8 am, 6 pm and 1 am (to reduce the recovery time). Log backups every hour or depending on what your business requires.
