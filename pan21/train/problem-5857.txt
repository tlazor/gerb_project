My laptop has been having some random problems with hibernating properly. That is a whole another topic that I still haven't resolved, but this is a different issue. The issues are connected, I guess, because one time after my computer experienced a failed hibernate, my login screen changed: since then my login screen always appears as the standard one with a prompt to type in a password. I can still use the finger scanner by clicking "other credentials" button. But that's annoying having to do that every time; previously the prompt to use finger scanner was the default one, whereas the typing password access was the alternate. How do I bring this arrangement back? In other words, how to switch the default from the type password prompt to the finger scan prompt? 
If fingerprint is read by standard biometric API it should be possible to swipe your finger over fingerprint reader even while it asks you for password (without going to fingerprint login method).
Sorry I can't be more specific, but I recall there's a Lenovo utility for configuring the biometric login options. It may be that you'll need to fire that up and tell it to assert itself as the default option.
I am not sure whether this will work if you use some Lenovo specific biometic API for this but in any case you should be able to uninstall Lenovo drivers and install manufacturer's drivers for fingerprint reader (Windows Update will usually find it).
From online searches, I have only found discussions of turning the biometric access on or off... but clearly it is turned on and working, since I can use it. It's just not the default for some reason...
