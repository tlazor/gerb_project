Hey, I'm creating my second game ever, but this time - using Java. Before I used Pascal and CRT module! =D It's 2D game where you need to drag the ball with mouse from location A to location B. Right now, I have ball on location A and I want to make it "alive". With that I mean that it will move from location A in 135째 direction until it reaches wall, then bounce the wall and move in 45째 direction, then again wall - in 315째 and so on.
The main problem is that I don't know how to covert degrees to coordinates and vice versa. For example I need to know x and y for 246째. Why? By knowing x and y I can move ball, because all my application basically is infinite loop that takes pause, then calculate x and y from degrees and then move ball. Please keep in mind that I'm very newbie to games development, I'm not good at math (unfortunately) and English isn't my native language... as you can see.
You can then take that unit vector and multiply it by whatever your per-frame velocity is to determine where you're going to be next frame.
Let's imagine that all board is 460x640 units big. So, as you can see in image above, ball's start location is 0. When the ball for the first time bounce the wall, location may be like x = 400, y = 480. In this example I have four possible directions like North, East, South and West, but in real game, when player drags the ball with his mouse, options may be more, right? I think so. So I think that I need to use degrees for it. I made list as example of what do I mean...
Basically, the answer you're looking for is that if you want to be 1 unit away for a given angle of x, your coordinate is going to be ( cos( x ), sin( x ) ).  You'll probably have to work in radians instead of degrees, though.
