I want to install CentOS as a server os using kickstart. I know normally you can install a system and get a copy of the kickstart file with the installation options you selected at install time. I'm totally blind though so the install is inaccessible. I'm looking for a basic kickstart file I can use as a template to automate the install of CentOS. The more minimal the install the better, I'd like to start out with a system that has SSH access and not much else. I'd rather add packages as I need them then try and remove everything I don't need.
If you're installing not from an optical drive but from a network you'll need to change that line, but this should be a good working minimal example. And once it's installed, yum grouplist and yum groupinfo  will be easy ways to get big chunks of software installed to turn it into a desktop if that's what you're looking for.
I use this at work for completely unattended installations on an HP pSeries Blade server.  You'll need to change the cciss/c0d0 style labels to match your SCSI controller.
