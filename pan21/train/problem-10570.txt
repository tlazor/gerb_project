I did really my best to build the above code and I was sure it is well structured, readable and maintainable. However, the criticism I received is that the code is not up to a good standard.

You can also check your jsfile with https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint which will give you some more optimization suggestion for your js code which will be helpful when we minify js.
