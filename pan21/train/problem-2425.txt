If gpo won't work...VMware PowerCLI (powershell & vmware) has Invoke-VMscript which you could use to execute update/deployment scripts on the VMs.  Requires VMware tools on each VM.
vSphere has a plug-in called Update Manager which will allow you to update Windows on the VMs (it also does ESXi host patches) and it works fairly well.  Your application install could be scripted through a login or startup script using AD or you could add it to the template you are cloning from.
It's a bit more complex than that in practice but it does give you the ability to patch once and have that roll out to all the VM's you are concerned with. There may be performance considerations too but this could make your life significantly easier if you have a lot of desktop images to manage.
Each VM is its own machine and has be to dealt with separately.  Patching can be handled via WSUS automatically, and software deployments can be done via AD so you don't need to touch any of the VMs to make it happen.
Depending on how many VM images you have to manage you may be much better off approaching this with VMware View. Amongst other things this allows you to use linked clones - the master template holds the actual XP image and the linked clones are diffs from this base. To patch all systems you patch the master image and then recompose the clones.
