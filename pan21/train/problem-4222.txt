While the router might be faulty, it seems to me much more likely that it is a memory leak.  Most off-the-shelf routers have them, and that is why so many people look towards after-market firmware like DD-WRT/OpenWRT/Tomato, which do a much better job of handling memory etc.
I'm having some trouble with my wireless router, so I thought I'd ask. I have a TP-Link WR941N, and every once in a while it will make internet speeds slow down by different degrees. I'm supposed to have 3 Mb/s, but sometimes I'll get anything from that down to 0.2 Mb/s on a couple of particulary bad days. I'm pretty sure it's the router's fault because I've tested with an older one and it works more or less fine, and it's not the wireless because this also happens on a wired PC.
If you suspect the router is faulty, you might try putting a fan across it to keep it cooler and see if it works better.  This won't do anything if it is a software problem, but could well make things work if its a hardware problem and heat buildup is affecting the tolerances of the components on the device.
I'm pretty sure this issue cause by your tplink router. I'm also using this tplink TL941N installed with DDWRT & having the same issue with u. After a while, wireless signal is degraded & intermittent disconnect. I tried a lot of setting & finally found the most stable setting.  This router has 3 antenna. Can u try to changes below setting in admin interface:-
4) in ddwrt setting under administrator, there is TCP congestion control. Use only reno or westwood. don't use vegas or hybla.
Of course, I don't expect anyone to be able to just tell me the solution with this little information. What I'd like to know is how to tell if there's a configuration issue or the thing is just faulty. I've been snooping around in the router's admin interface, but I haven't had much success. Are there configuration options that are a known cause of problems like this?
