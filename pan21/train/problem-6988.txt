If you pick some low stratum servers they should all be within a few ms of each other (if not better) and provided they are configured correctly you shouldn't need to worry. If your requirements grow and you need to sync more machines then you could run your own server to ensure that what you serve internally only ever comes from 1 reference source at a time.
As you have seen the problem with just using the pool is that you may get any server it decides based on the dns query, in your situation you should pick 3 - 5 low stratum servers directly and add those to your config on both machines. ntp likes to have a minimum of 3 servers and ideally 5 to sync from to ensure a robust time domain.
Firstly ntpdate is depreciated so you shouldn't use that in a production environment now. You should configure and run the ntp daemon correctly configured instead for a reliable timing setup and removing the chances that you will jump the server time (as ntp will continually adjust the clock as required)
