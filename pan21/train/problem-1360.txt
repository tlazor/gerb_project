You'll have some of the basic PDF-browsing features but not some others -- KParts are not meant to be full applications. Thus, you won't (for example) be able to annotate the PDF in Konqueror as you would be able to in Okular, for instance. But as long as you just want basic viewing, this will be enough :)
KParts and all the modularity of the KDE framework allows for some pretty neat stuff, in my opinion. 
Thus, because Konqueror has a split view, you automatically get a split-viewable PDF reader for free. Just open up a Konqueror window, split its view, and open up the PDF in each pane. Each can scroll independently of each other, etc.
This is a bit of a strange answer, but Konqueror (the default everything-browser for KDE) can do what you want. You see, Konqueror is not just a web browser or just a file browser -- it is a browser for any type of data that there exists a KPart for (where a KPart is some type of component that KDE can understand and embed places -- things like Konsoles, Kate windows, and -- of interest on this occasion -- KPDF viewers).
