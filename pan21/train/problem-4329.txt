To disable 8.3 name creation on all NTFS partitions, type fsutil.exe behavior set disable8dot3 1 at an elevated command prompt, and then press Enter.
Note: Although disabling 8.3 file name creation increases file performance under Windows, some applications (16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit) may not be able to find files and directories that have long file names.
Unfortunately the only way to really deal with this is an annoying set of gyrations, depending on your version of windows, disabling the ability to generate 8.3 names.
I'm not exactly how sure the script works and how your network it setup but how about filtering via something in front of the IIS server (even if it's just a virtual device in a virtual machine)? Namely, you setup an IPS with a rule that specifically drops traffic pertaining to that particular issue?
"NOTE: The change to the NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation registry entry affects only files, folders, and profiles that are created after the change. Files that already exist are not affected. "
