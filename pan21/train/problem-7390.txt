There is so much I can say on this, I almost didn't write an answer because I didn't think I would touch all the points I need to - if you want clarification or more information on any points, feel free to ask.
On my home network, I have a Windows XP host with a VirtualBox FreeBSD guest, with a bridged network interface.
I have a router running Tomato firmware.  Every machine on the network--real or virtual--gets a static DHCP entry that includes its hostname.  I set the "Use Internal Caching DNS Forwarder" option in Tomato, and the result is that every DHCP client uses the Tomato router as its DNS server, and the router correctly answers requests with the static DHCP hostnames.
In Windows 2003/2008, you can install DHCP Server and DNS Server, create a new zone for each of the domains you want - and put the IP of your main machine. (In Linux, you can obviously do the same, but I can't really recommend much - in the past, I have used Ubuntu Server + Webmin to do the hard work, if you are good at Linux, you may find it easy - but I find using Windows Server to be much simpler for this.)
If you do not want to use them, then take a look at creating another Virtual Machine and installing either Linux with a DNS server (I can't really recommend any distributions over any others), or Windows Server 2003 (or 2008).
All you need to do from the client machines is set to automatic IP and make sure that the DHCP server is the only one accessible, or skip DHCP and just set the DNS server to the IP of the virtual machine. If you also set forwarders (or just use Root Hints) on the DNS server, it should be able to fully resolve all sites on the internet as well as serving the sites you want.
