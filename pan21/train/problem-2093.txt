I am running Windows 8.1 and am trying to download Windows 10 for installation on another machine. I have a brand new 4GB SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB drive that has been formatted.
Using a suggestion from MC10 in the comments, I downloaded the ISO and used Rufus to configure the USB drive as bootable. The configuration and install worked fine and there was about 700 MB free on the thumbdrive after configuring it.
I still could not identify the cause of the failure, whether the Media Creation Tool incorrectly viewed the USB drive as too small or if there is another problem that makes the USB drive not appear to be valid to the tool.
In the Media Creation Tool, I select the options I want, Create installation media for another PC, English (US), Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit, USB flash drive. On the Select a USB flash drive step, I get the message "We can't find a USB flash drive".
I had same porblem with external hdd and also with usb drive. I tried all USB 3.0 ports and it didnÂ´t work so I tried to plug them into USB 2.0 port and it work perfectly. So you should try to plug it into USB 2.0 because windows creation tool probably have some problem with USB 3.0 ports. 
The Sandisk Cruzer usb drives use drivers that install through windows 7 and 8 as if they were hard drives. They are not in the removable drives section and that is why it will not allow you to select it.
I have tried the front and rear ports of the PC, formatted FAT32, formatted NTFS, quick and full format. Device properties shows Disk drive on USB Mass Storage Device. Drive is the default Windows driver, 6.3.9600.16384, 6/21/2006.
