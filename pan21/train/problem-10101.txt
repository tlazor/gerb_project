If these are not correct then use a tool like nmap to scan all NICs on the network. If you are unluckly you will just get an list of all active devices on your subnet (3-4 IPs, try them all). If you are lucky if will even identify which one. Nmap is rather good at that but I never tried it on a tomato device.
The next steps are for if you find yourself where I was and the router/switch is on a different network then your real network
The IP of the Linksys has not changed simply because it stopped servering DHCP requests for other PCs. If can still access it it the same IP it had before.
Best bet: Reset the router. The DHCP will turn back on and you can then connect. Credentials are probably admin/admin. If the DCHP was off, you probably weren't using it for much more than the wifi function, so there won't be many settings to reconfigure.
Mind you do not do this on a network unless either you own it (your home network) or you have written permission to do it on their network.
You're still able to connect to the router that this is connected to, and serves as your DHCP, right? That might be able to have a list of connected devices. If not, you would at least know the base range of ip ranges (192.168.0.* or 192.168.1.*). If you know roughly how many other devices are connected, you could guess the address from there. Or reset that dhcp router, connect with some pc and find its ip address. Then connect the new dhcp-less router, and its ip will be +1 of the last known address.
If you have forgotten which IP that was then first try the firat and last IPs of you network, since this is traditional the IP where a default gateway would be placed. And if I read your question correctly it was both DHCP server and default gateway before you made changes.
