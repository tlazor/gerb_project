Well, I was quite bugged by this problem, so finally I coded a solution which comes very close: a filtering plugin for the Glipper clipboard manager, which allows for regex processing in filter functions, which can be applied to the clipboard contents upon a Copy action; released here:
replacing 5 with however many commands you want to go back.  That should get you a clean listing that will copy/paste easily.  Not exactly the kind of approach you seem to be fishing for, but it might suit.
Unfortunately, it's developed for Gnome/Gtk 2 / Python 2.7, so it's already deprecated; still, hope it can hope others (until I hear of a better solution - hopefully in this thread :)),
In the end, I would still have preferred that the terminal itself has a keyboard chord for filtered output (say, press Ctrl+Shift+a, then release a, then while holding the others press c) - but then that would be OK for a single filter; and if you want to choose one from several filters at runtime, again there is the problem of having of yet another action to do a choice; and if it is solved via GUI window of menu entries - then this pluggin is just as good, I guess. Even better, it works for any GUI source of (copyable) text under Gnome desktop - not just for terminal.
Paste - the pasted contents are modified by the clicked filter (e.g. for TermCmdLog the input has prompts removed, and non-prompt lines commented)
Noam Manos already pointed out in the other answer Gnome Terminal does allow block copy with Ctrl + Mouse click and drag. I just wanted to point out another alternative which is more powerful. The tmux supports putting your terminal in "copy mode" and allows you to do block copy and much more -- It even supports multiple paste buffers that you can copy and use later.
However, since I want to use this only occasionally, toggling filtering may not be the best idea (since you have to toggle ON, copy/paste, and then toggle OFF) - so the plugin bypasses normal operation when a filter submenu entry is clicked, if Ctrl, Alt or c are held; so my "minimal" action to perform a one-off prompt filtering is like this:
