If you're trying to decompress a GZipped file through Java, you may wish to consider using the java.util.zip.ZipFile class. If you pass this class a File reference to a zip file, you can iterate through your entries and access them as InputStreams, like so:
The '-c' option means write to standard output (rather than modifying the input file); the '-d' option means 'decompress'.
(On more modern versions, option '-j' can be used to create a bzip2-compressed tar file; the unwrap code determines the correct decompressor automatically.)
To answer the original question, doctorruss is correct in suggesting the use of a class. To access a .tar, .tar.gz or .tgz file, you should use a library capable of accessing tar archives. The package com.ice.tar implements a tar archive io package, and it is possible to combine this package with the java.util.zip package to handle .tar.gz files. You can either download directly, or find it in org.apache.tools.tar which is now part of ant.jar.
I agree with Jonathan Leffler, this is a java programmer asking how to access a compressed archive from his/her java program. The fact that it's a novice programmer, trying to do it the wrong way (through the OS), doesn't change that fact that this is a programming question that belongs on StackOverflow.
