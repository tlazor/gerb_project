The filesystem was about 5TB in size, and had a ext4 filesystem. Linux kernel 4.9 on Debian stretch 9.11. I know I have lost some data, but I'd like to get as much as possible from this disk. The data is replaceable, but not easily. I don't have a backup. The machine as 3.8GB of RAM and 650 GB of swap. While running there is very little free memory, but swap is hardly used. Is that a problem?
I have a filesystem on a LVM device which suffered a disk failure. Some data was lost (since one of the 4 disks which had data is gone). I am trying to mount this filesystem so as to recover as much data as possible (see other question). I am running fsck on it, and it reports many lines like this:
And then does some work with "fixing" some filesystem stuff. But then fsck stops. If I run it again, I can see lots of similar errors, and some from hihgh inode/block numbers, and then it does a little bit more. So fsck is changing something. I have it run in a loop and it is (slowly) getting through the disk. From the fsck progress bar, I can see that it is progressing through the disk.
But at every run it has to process the same start until it gets to "new" stuff. How can I make fsck not die so that it will continue rather than repeating work? Or, if theses inodes/blocks are broken, can I somehow "clear"/"reset"/"delete" them so that it will not print these error messages (and hopefully run quicker)?
