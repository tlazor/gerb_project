Rather than trying to figure out which files are in bad sectors, you should IMMEDIATELY back up all important data on this drive. Even a single bad sector is a serious issue and could indicate that drive failure is imminent; 4KB of bad sectors is quite substantial. When a sector fails, others often (but not always) will follow. Once you have backed up your data, install a S.M.A.R.T monitoring program (there are many out there; just search Google) and check the bad sector count regularly. If it increases, replace the drive.
You probably haven't lost any data yet, so I don't think there's a point in figuring out which specific files were stored in the bad sectors. When a hard drive detects an anomaly in a sector (read/write speed slower than usual, for example), it will immediately move any data stored there to a sector in a special "reserve" pool. Then, it will mark the problem sector as "bad" to make sure it is never used again. It is only when you exhaust the entire reserve pool that you start losing data.
