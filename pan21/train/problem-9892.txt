I've combed through the SSAS project in data tools, and I can't find any reference to this member. Does anyone have an idea of what might be going on here? This and this were the two common themes I found in my searches, but as I said before, everything from the first cube was overwritten or deleted, so I can't find anything in the cube that references the missing member.
My team built an SSAS cube a year or two ago; it was the second cube we've built. We rolled it out to a few teams who have been using it without any issues. Today, I sat down with a new user to set up the data connection in Excel and do a little training, and the user received a strange error:
What's strange is that the member in the error message does not exist in this particular cube. It exists in the first cube our team built, but none of the calculations or queries in the second cube use members from the first cube. We used the first cube as a template for the second cube, but all the original measures/dimensions were overwritten or deleted.
As far as I know, no other users have seen this error including users in the same AD group. The security is pretty basic on the cube, AD groups are used in the database roles, nothing is dynamic and we aren't using MDX to specify security.
