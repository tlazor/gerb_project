I also want to warn you against overconfidence. The more confident you are in your ability to spot scams, the more likely it is you'll fall for one. Many, many self-proclaimed experts who thought they knew better have fallen for phishing scams or advance-fee fraud.
If you're smart/safe enough to filter out obviously bad downloads (such as reading comments), you can still be protected, as well as by keeping your AV up to date and enabled (along with a firewall).  But, don't get complacent.
These are actually two sides of the same coin. Always remember that neither your computer nor your own brain are impregnable.
Yes, you can get infected from "just using Firefox". Firefox is just software, and all software has bugs. Using NoScript greatly reduces the attack surface available to the bad guys, but there are still other attack vectors that may be vulnerable (e.g. downloading a corrupt font). That's why it's important to keep your browser and OS up-to-date...but that's still not a guarantee of safety. Even if you use "best practices" and run your browser in a sandbox in a VM in a limited user account, you can still get infected.
Yes.  File downloads are a great way to get them, especially when using P2P services like torrents, LimeWire, BearShare, etc.
I just wanted to know if there is any way you could actually get infected without (iframes, javascript, flash) enabled when using firefox.
Yes it is. As Kruug mentions, viruses can and will attack any computer that is plugged into the internet or has infected media connected to it. There are enough botnets doing random attacks that unpatched machines can be infected within minutes. Anything less then complete isolation will lessen your risk but not eliminate it. For most people this is an unreasonable level of security, but if you install a good AV, keep up with your updates and use common sense when browsing the web you should be fine.
