My question is the following: Is anybody know how to check the bandwith usage over this linksys switch? An application that can be linked to it to check the bandwith? Or even better, a port scanner over the whole network that I can see what is taking that much of my bandwith.
SNMP might give some statistics off that RV082. Here is a site that might help with some information on gathering information from it.
How are you load-balancing across these two links?  Floating static routes or some kind of hardware device?  If you have firewalls (please say 'yes'), then they could also be dropping some of your traffic if it is asymmetric.
My ping on many websites are ok. Tracert also ok. I've performed a DOS test on my ISP's ftp site (Videotron.ca) and I get between 500k/700k download. (This is a normal home plan speed result) but I have twice a home power!
You could set up a mirror on your firewall port and send that to a sniffer (ntop is a good open source one) to get a better idea what the traffic is.
We are using a dual cable connection. 2 cable modem DOCSIS (10MB-Down/1MB-UP) connected to 2 Cisco SoHo routeur 800 Series. These are going to a Linksys Switch (Dual WAN) 10/100 8-port VPN Router RV082 (Firmware Version: 1.3.98-tm). 
So basically, when I go on speedtest.net, I am supposed to hit like 18mb Download... right now, I hit only 11mb. My issue is that I am suspecting some users on the network to download torrents or stuff like that. Unfortunately, I have no apps to check that remotely. (If only I could have MS SMS!!!)
You can't take two 10Mb links and get a 20Mb link.  What you could have is two 10Mb downloads going at the same time.  (This is a gross over simplification by the way.)
I am here today to ask for some of your precious help! Many users of my Windows Networks are complaining about slow connection (intranet/Internet) but I called my ISP and everything seems to be fine.
