Your computer does NOT have connectors for each section, and so the headphones when connected to the computer are less capable than they are when connected to your phone.
You should be able to confirm this in the system technical documentation, but the short version is this:
Headphones use specific electrical signalling usually through the microphone part of the 4-pin jack connector and a simple circuit, where the buttons are (in that block), cares of this. These are distinct impulses that the smartphone handles to perform the action (including for example call pick-up). However, hardware-wise this may not be uniform (different brands of headphones may use different signals for volume control). As far as I know, apple and android headphones have sometimes even reversed ground and microphone pin (CTIA standard and OMTP standard)
Count the number of individual sections on your headphone plug: Your phone probably has individual connectors for each section and so can utilize all the features of the headphones.
It is possible, however the equipment required is not usually present in the computer (motherboard of the computer). You would probably need some box/external sound card that has that 4-pin jack connector and can interface the computer through, let's say USB, so that it can perform macros (just like programmable buttons on a mouse). This sound card would need to distinguish the variety of impulses generated by headphones to perform the correct action (vol. up, vol. down) in the OS. You need to search for such a product, if it is even on the market. (It is a bit technical, sorry.)
