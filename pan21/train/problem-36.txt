Besides the legal aspect there's also a security issue.  It's not always a bad thing that your signal doesn't go (far) outside your house.  Wifi snooping is rampant and you'll never know if the snooper can sit 1/2 a mile away and pick up your illegally boosted signal.  If your signal is legal (weak) he might have to park in front of your house to get it.
If your laptop can pick up the signal after increasing the signal strength on the router, and successfully connect to it, that means it can communicate with it just fine. Chances are your laptop may be equipped with wireless-n while the router is only wireless-g. Placing of antennas and polarization can also make a big difference.
+1 for Harrymc's answer, especially the first three.  Increasing the output power of your current transmitter is most likely illegal though enforcement will vary a lot by where you live.    
The easiest way to increase the router's signal is to pass to channel 11, which is the strongest. Changing the channel might also solve the problem if there is interference in that part of the house coming from your neighbor's router, but not if the problem comes from walls or an electrical appliance.
