The ServerFault question is slightly out of date, and I only know the answer for the VMware platform. Short answer: yes, with restrictions. The latest versions of Workstation and ESX support running the latest version of ESX inside a VM for demonstration purposes. You can then build up a guest VM and run that from inside the guest ESX instance. You do need to edit the VM config though to turn on some advanced options.
You can but you would be highly limited to resources. I recommend VirtualBox for something like this... and a lot of RAM
Not seriously. YOu can with software simulation (slow). But hardware virtualization (fast) only supports ONE layer. Because noone seriously needs more.
I have had success in running ESX under fusion 2.0, with several VMs but as other have mentioned it did require a bit of tweaking to get it running. I assume this is mostly for testing so I can see the reasons for doing it as was with my case. I cant imagine anyone doing this for production. 
Also, as someone did point out it does require a bit of resources but I was able to manage all this on a mac pro with 4GB.
