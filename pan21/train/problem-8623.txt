Page 117 is your need, and for the ISO path you'd use /vmfs/volumes/XXXX/ where XXXX is the actual volume storage you're looking for; in my case I have two standalone servers that use their own internal RAID arrays, so the symlink is /vmfs/volumes/SERVERNAME:storage1/ that gives me the root (I store my iso files under a /iso/ subdir).
You can always mount an ISO within the guest using an ISO mounting application (for Windows Guests Daemon Tools or Microsofts Virtual CD driver would be examples.) In general you won't have access to the storage visible to the Hypervisor from within the Guest so mounting an ISO stored on a VMFS Datastore wont be possible but if you are storing your ISO's on an NFS share you could map to that from within the Guest and mount it that way with one of the above tools (or an equivalent for whatever OS you are running in the guest).
I am not sure exactly why you say mounting the iso with the VIC client would be over the network, maybe I am misunderstanding how you mean you would be mounting it. But in any case, if you go into "Edit Settings" on the machine on the CD/DVD drive tab there is an option to use "Datastore ISO file". This will let you connect to the ISO on the EX server, and is independent of the VIC client window, meaning once you save the setting you can close the client and the ISO will still be accessible. I have several servers running boot CDs setup like this.
However if you don't want to run the full fat VI Client on the machine you want to make the changes from you can still use the VI Web Access console to mount\dismount ISO's for VM's. You connect to the VI Web Access console from the link on the upper right hand side of the default Web page that you will see if you point a browser at the ip-address of either the service console\management network address of the ESX\ESXi Server or the Virtual Center server. There is a brief intro to using VI Web Access in this Petri Knowledgebase article.
