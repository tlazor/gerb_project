As you mention successfully doing 'recompile the whole kernel' you are ready to go without doing recompiling whole kernel again. 
Most of user fail to do module only compile just because not having all required header library source available. Full kernel compiling mean other required lib file in place. 
If you carefully look on your eror message created by make command when compile module alone, you will get information of ether error on source syntax / mission lib file or it failing other error like missing dependency modules/source. 
Hope at this point if everything done properly and make exit without having any error. Now you already have your_module.ko ready to install on module path of your system. 
As far I can remember adding 'M' switch tell make to compile modules for directory of source indicate with , before 'preparing' with necessary lib/header files. 
Above steps are same for compiling full kernel or module only mak. Now if you need to make ONLY module let your make command 'prepare' itself with necessary change automatically interlinked lib/config files for modules on target to make. Try two command bellow:
