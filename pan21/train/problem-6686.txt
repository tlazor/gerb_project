Set the tables into a normal rank and file arrangement with a gap between each column that allows you to walk between the students when seated. (The gap with students in their chairs will be less than it looks like with empty seats.) In this arrangement you can get to any student's station to assist them when needed. In addition, because of the geometry of the half hex layout, the gap between neighboring students is increased, allowing more room for you to reach the table top without disturbing either student.
Place them so that the center seat is facing the front of the room and the other two seats will only need to pivot 60 degrees from their screens to see the front. The students will still be able to look at other screens, but not without being obvious about it. It naturally groups the students into teams of three for when you have team-based assignments. 
A modification to the traditional classroom arrangement that is relatively simple is to replace the straight tables with half hexagon tables.
You can have a pair of mirrors installed in the two rear cournes near the ceiling. In the mirrors you will be able to see basically what they have on their screens. Reading it, or even knowing for sure what it is won't be possible, however, you will be able to tell if it's what should be there. Games and videos will have a totally different look from an IDE, for example.
Half hexagon tables are available in some different set ups. You can use the standard, non-computer style that may even be in storage already. I've found some online that are designed, nominally, for computer use, and a bit larger to accomodate the keyboard and monitor space requirements better. I've also found one that's designed completly for computer workstations, including a keyboard tray and a cage for the tower. (Links at the end.).
Not knowing the constraints of the classroom itself, I can only give a sample layout. Allowing for 36 students, you could arrange the room similar to this.
