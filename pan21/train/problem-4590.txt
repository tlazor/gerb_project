BWM Rule should be set to advanced for this to work. If you need further help I recommend looking up implementing BWM on a Sonicwall, or just message me and I'll be glad to help more.
So they share the same exit to the internet with all the traffic in the clinic. The only traffic who  pass through the Sonicwall is the PACS traffic. So probably we have a bottleneck in the internet exit. But that network is beyond my control.
So I want to apply some kind of Qos to the VPN to guarantee at least 50% of the bandwidth. however I dont know if this going to work because the topology in this clinic is like this.
I have one main site is a clinic where we have a PACS server. So we have 3 more clinics around the country  with VPN to send  pictures to the server. Now we have  4 NSA 220  one in each site. The VPN is working  but  one of the sites is really slow. We have 1MB dedicated line in each site. In the main site we have 10MB.
You need to create a Bandwidth Management Rule (BWM) Rule and apply it to a LAN > VPN firewall rule or DMZ > VPN if you have it in the DMZ. You can customize it for each individual site connection through source and destination or VPN connections as a whole.
