If unsure for the powersupply you can test out with a multimeter but it can be hard to do. A small video link on the howto there. It exist some tool to test the powersupply, as some led will show if all the voltage are correct. 
I have been having a problem where my PC turns on for about 20 seconds, but then restarts. The pc doesn't connect to a monitor, and I have a backlit keyboard that I  connected to it, but the keyboard doesn't light up when it is on. It used to restart every 3 seconds, but I moved a ram card to a different slot, and now it is doing this. I have vacuumed out the pc, and it didn't change anything. The thermal paste on the cpu was old and dried out, so I don't know if it is working properly. I have tried unplugging all the unnecessary components, and it still doesn't work. I don't know if this is a power supply problem. Is there a way to fix this?
When you removed unnecessary components, or maybe just remove the RAM completly, does the system give/gave beeps code ? If no I would think it's a bad motherboard first.
