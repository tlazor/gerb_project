However, I'm leaning toward the idea of performing a single deployment to Elastic Beanstalk, and configuring the environment to serve the content from an Elastic File System. This could then be shared to any of the instances within the autoscaling group created by Elastic Beanstalk.
I know that, with a lot of hacks/tweaks, I could configure a local Joomla environment, then use that for site administration and push changes to the EB app using Git.
I know that creating and mounting an EFS to the instances within the EB can be achieved with the configuration files found here, however, although the EFS is indeed mounted, the application still appears to be served from the local drive.
I'd really like to be able to use Elastic Beanstalk to host a Joomla application. However, there are a couple of issues:
It seems to be that I either need a way to create a symbolic link between the application root and the mount directory, or simply to change the root directory of the application to be the mount directory itself. The problem is that I can't quite work out how to do either of these things.
Furthermore, there are official AWS instructions for deploying a Wordpress site using EFS here. Upon inspection of the config files in the .ebextensions folder, I can see that the config file that mounts the EFS creates a symbolic link between the mount directory and the wp-content/uploads. This may work for a Wordpress installation, but what I would like to do with Joomla is to serve the entire application from an EFS.
