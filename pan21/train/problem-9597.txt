Therefore any DNS queries sent to ns1.MyDomain.com will then be sent to the IP for ns1.VPSProvider.com instead and they will respond
The domain is registered with 123-reg. Therefore, how/where do I add a dns record for ns1.MyDomain.com would it be with 123-reg's help? Is it just a CNAME record of ns1?
For example, they have said I need a DNS records directing ns1.MyDomain.com to the IP of ns1.VPSProvider.com. 
Frankly, if you do not know the DNS at all, it is better to not use "vanity name servers", specially for paying customers...
Secondly, are their any disadvantages by having a vanity nameserver like this e.g. spam, google, rdns etc
My VPS hosting provider has agreed that I can use their DNS servers to present a more professional look by giving out vanity nameservers to my clients.
You cannot use CNAME records since the right-hand side of a NS record cannot be an alias (RFC 1035, section 3.6.2).You have to use A and AAAA records and keep them in synch with VPSProvider.com. Not easy because they can change suddenly.
