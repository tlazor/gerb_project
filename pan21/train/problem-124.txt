That aside, while you can't source the remote files directly using datapump, you can use DBMS_File_Transfer or DBMS_Scheduler to move them from one db server to another: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e25494/dfiles008.htm
Either I'm missing something here, or Oracle left a huge gap in functionality between impdp and imp.
Dump files are read and written directly by the server and, therefore, do not require any data movement to the client.
Am I missing something or is it not possible to import a dump (.dmp) file using impdp to a database on another server other than where it was created?  All of my investigations lead me to believe that this cannot be done...that the dump file needs to reside locally on the server where the data is to be imported or NFS mounted so it appears to be local.  This seems to be a capability that the old "exp/imp" utilities used to have, but no longer exist.  I know you can move data using impdp and the REMOTE_LINK option but in order to use this, the data must physically reside in a schema within the database instance on the remote side for it to be copied.  It can't reside in a dump/exported file.  
impdp/expdp unlike imp/exp does not move the data. They only invoke DBMS_DATAPUMP package and actual data movement is done by the Oracle instance. So data pump can access external data the same way as all other Oracle procedures - loading files via directory object or SELECT data via dblink.
There is an option to perform a datapump import by sourcing the data from another database via a database link, which gets you closer to a solution under some circumstances, particularly if you can use flashback on the source database to export as of some time in the recent past. http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e22490/dp_overview.htm#CJABHJHD
For example.  I have Server "A" and Server "B".  Each of them with an Oracle instance on it.  On "A", I perform an export using expdp of schema "TESTDATA" to a dumpfile named "testdata.dmp" where it is store on "A".  At some point in the future I would like to restore the contents of the "TESTDATA" dump file (testdata.dmp) to a new schema (TESTDATA2) on server "B".
