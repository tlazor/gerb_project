Don't forget that a leaked document might stay around forever. Do you want such things to come to bite you in the back in 10 years? In 20? 
This is NOT SAFE since the URLs will be going over the wire in plain text. An attacker can use a tool like Ethereal to sniff the URLs and then visit them himself. Maybe add an htaccess/htpasswd to a "Secure Area" or equivalent if not using Apache?
In the academic world, where attackers are constantly trying to listen to conversations between Alice and Bob, this is not safe for a myriad of reasons that others will list.
I've occasionally had occasion when I needed to share some as-yet "private" data (i.e. unedited drafts of audio lectures) so it can be reviewed by authorized people before being made public.  Typically I do this by giving the file an obscure name (i.e. a newly generated GUID) and emailing or IMing the link to the person.  Of course there is no link to the file from other pages on the site.  Is this actually safe or is there some vulnerability I'm overlooking?  Not that there are any nuclear secrets being passed this way, but I still want to make sure I'm not missing something.
