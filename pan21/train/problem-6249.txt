The statement of "Access denied for user 'username'@'localhost' (using password: YES)", can surface even before a connection is even made to the database server. I am going to guess this is most likely the issue since I am guessing you know the correct password and I will also make the assumption that you know you have the correct permissions to the tables you are trying to access since you stated you have a user that you use to from your website to make db queries.
Use the config.sample.inc.php to create your own config.inc.php (in the phpMyAdmin folder) which includes lines like this (the default will probably work for you):
You have to add username@% record where "%" is the wildcard meaning "from anywhere". Or, more securely, you can add record like username@11.22.33.44 or username@mydomain.tld
You didn't really specify where the eclipse instance is but I am going to guess on a workstation that is not on the same network as your server. I would first make sure that you can make a connection to the database server. MySQL by default runs on port tcp/3306. I would just try making a telnet connection to see if it connects, "telnet (db_server_ip) 3306". If the connection is closed than you will need to open ports from you work station to your db server depending upon the amount of firewalls that are in the way.
I have a user that I use from my php pages to make queries to mysql db, and now IÂ´m trying to use the same user in eclipse/BIRT in order to build some reports but I get the error
