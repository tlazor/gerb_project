The dropcams are always on. The phones are usually in use. Either the iPad or iPod is likely to be in use by my son. I might be on the Xbox and my wife is usually on her laptop. The rest of the things connected are used sporadically.
I don't have a lot of time to play around during the week, but this morning I had enough time to plug a second router into the first router. The first router is set to channel 11. The second router is set to channel 1. I left the dropcams connected to router #1 and started switching the iphones and laptops over to router #2. The speed difference between router #1 and router #2 is significant.
Up until this morning I had a Linksys E? (fairly new one) hooked up to a cable modem. Our internet was unusable.
I am wondering if I should put a switch in front of the routers? I suppose I should at least turn off DCHP on the second router and just make it an access point? It would be nice if I could get all of my devices onto 1 wifi network to be a good citizen. I live in a condo complex and at any given time I can see 12+ wifi networks already. Would a commercial router / access point be able to handle the dropcams and everything else?
