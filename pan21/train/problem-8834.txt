If you want to split traffic to different external IP addresses on the same interface you can define an IP Pool (with possibly just a single address) and use that in a policy instead of Use Outgoing Interface Address.
Two different LAN IP group's internet traffic should go though 2 different WAN connections in fortigate 60D (Currently its WAN Zone(wan1 and wan2) . How to do that configuration?
1- pull WAN2 from the WAN zone to make it addressable. WAN1 remains in the zone, no changes required.
In your case, this is not enough because you want traffic from different sources to follow different routes through different interfaces. For this, use a Policy Route. To match a PR, you can specify the source subnet address as well as the destination (which is '0.0.0.0/0' for the default route).  
Traffic to unknown target networks has to follow the default route. But, there is only 1 default route per system/FGT (for obvious reasons). To match a (static) route the FGT only looks at the destination IP address.  
The easiest way is to split traffic by firewall policy - just the one WAN interface for one set of policies and the other interface for another set.
