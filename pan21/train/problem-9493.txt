from the commmand prompt.  Say yes to do this after reboot.  Wait till you have hours of spare time.  For example, just before you go to bed, reboot verify the chkdsk is running and then go to bed.  All of the mentioned file systems have a "bad block" flag that will prevent the OS from using the bad sectors.
The next best answer is a specialized tool.  mhdd or Spinrite will both interact with the hard drives SMART function and cause the bad sectors to be completely hidden.  Both of these tools are highly advanced and can sometimes even recover the corrupted data.  The biggest downside is if you have more than >50-100 bad sectors it could take days for the process to complete.
Downside if you ever move the partition the bad sectors will still be an issue.  Increasing the partition will not be an issue.
Caution:  The hard drive has a limited number usually only a few hundred spare sectors and it is quite possible to run out.  After they run out the hard drive can not hide any additional bad sectors.  However, mhdd or spinrite in some cases can revive the sectors.
