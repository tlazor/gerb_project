Your best bet would be to buy yourself a cheap laptop for a little bit more than what the second hard disk would cost.  If you do that, you only have to worry about voiding the warranty on your laptop.
I recommend buying a cheap laptop of your own instead.  Why play around with someone else's property at all?  A new HD will cost, what, $200 for a decent one.  A laptop in full should cost less than $500.  A netbook would be $300-400.
I don't know who your "loaner" laptop is from and under what sort of terms your loaner was provided.  Clearly the entity making the loan had some reason for locking down the operating system.  Any of the various scenarios you've described involving switching the existing hard disk or adding a second hard disk could be considered a breach of the terms of the loan.  You could find that you now own the laptop (at probably an inflated price) or that you are unemployed (if the laptop belonged to your employer).
Why not simply make a boot CD? Then you just boot whatever OS you want from the CD and still have access to the files on the original HD.
Get a large internal hard drive - say 500Gig ($100).  Clone the existing drive and then wrap it up and put it away.  On the remaining space, put on your secondary OS as the dual boot.  When it comes time to return the laptop, remove your drive and reinstall the original.
