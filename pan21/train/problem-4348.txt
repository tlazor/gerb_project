Who knows? Those are hardly unbiased tests, and even with fancy new features, IE will probably still not follow web standards. 
In any case, we've gone beyond "One best browser" these days. Most browsers are "fast enough" compared to the competition, and IE has such a bad (Yet well deserved) reputation among most web developers, that IE-only features are unlikely to be adopted in any kind of widespread manner. IE9 could surprise us all and be fantastic, but we'll have to wait until we can actually get our hands on it to find that out.
There's more to a web browser than standards conformance. Think back to IE6, which was alright in its day, but lacked tabs.
I'd try and find a test that wasn't hosted by Microsoft, Google or Apple (for example) and was from someone or an organisation you could trust to be independent.
That said, IE is getting better lately. Hating IE is starting to become the "cool thing to do" that everyone does baselessly out of habit. I'll admit I haven't given IE8 a fair shot yet.
These results are probably a good starting point and will be accurate, but won't necessarily test a realistic browsing session.
