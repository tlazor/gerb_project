If one of the PCs involved is stronger than consumer-grade Windows and has multiple ports, I believe that it could act as the router too.  I don't think XP or Vista can act as a router, though.
But my guess is we are talking $50 cheapie firewalls here, so you are probably looking at scrounging another box to do this job.
Then, Gateway A would have a route on it telling it that Network "B" was reachable via the A address on the router; Gateway B would have a route on it telling it that network "A" was reachable via the B address on the router.
The router needs to have two separate ethernet connecters on it.  The reason for this is because if you are using DHCP on either network, you need to be able to isolate the DHCP traffic to the appropriate network.  If you just glue the two networks together with an ethernet wire, there's no way to guarantee that PCs on network A wouldn't get DHCP from network B, and then use network B's internet.
Now if you have a Linux-based firewall as either Gateway, then you can probably just put another ethernet card in it and have that Gateway act as the router as well, but that's left as an exercise for the reader.
As a short term fix, you could replace one of the Gateways with a small switch, disconnect the DSL from that side of the network, and run a long cable to the other apartment.  Then reboot the computers on the now-disconnected side.  That would make those computers join the other network, which means that for the duration of the game they'd be using the Internet from the other apartment, but it would at least let you play.  ie:
Also, if you have a more "business" level firewall as either gateway, you may be able to mark some ports as a different "security zone" and use that box as the router.
