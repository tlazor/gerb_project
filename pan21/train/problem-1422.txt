Newer Versions of Kodi have the possibility to use MPEG-DASH. If activated, it will override the General settings. There you can achive 1080p with 60fps

Yes, you can set the quality for all YouTube videos. Because you use the Add-on called YouTube, there is the possibility to configure some settings. Open the settings in the Add-on, just where you open your subcriptions, playlists, login/logout and so on.
