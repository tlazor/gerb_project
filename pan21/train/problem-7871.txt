The short answer: Iterate, iterate, iterate. Start small, and get something running before trying to implement the whole system. It's still important to do some top-level design and planning, but being able to see what you're working with and playtest parts as you go is incredibly important to staying motivated; it's hard for me (and most any other programmer I know) to work day in and day out on something that doesn't actually show them visible results.
I have a ritual of disconnecting my network cable before I go to bed. The next morning - I'm not online, so I have no sites to visit, no emails to read, no people to chat to, etc. So I naturally get straight to work on my game.
That's how I assembled my game studio. We are three partners working on the game for the last two years as a weekend hobby. We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel now. 
I have been working on my hobby project now for around 2-3 months. That means evening or two every now and then plus weekends occasionally. The project is maybe 2/3 done for a proper first release. It is maybe too early to call it success but here are the things that have kept me going so far:
I don't connect again until I absolutely have to. If there's something I need online - I write it down to look up later, or use my iPhone's browser.
Also, by having regular meetings, it encourage you to work on your project to show progress or reach your deadline.
