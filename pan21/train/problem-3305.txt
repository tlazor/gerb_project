If that's what you're doing, you can use pre-signed URLs to allow the browser to upload the object directly to S3. The upload doesn't need to pass through your web server at all.
The server will be apache or nginx on a linux OS with https enabled. Processing language will be php 7. 
There's a good collection of sample bucket policies here. Taking one of these and modifying it, a policy that would allow anyone to upload a file to an S3 bucket, but restrict the file size to 1GB is:
As partially mentioned by @duskwuff if you're allowing users to upload files directly to S3 then you can restrict the size of the uploaded object via S3 Bucket Policies.
If you want to limit uploads to specific users, or force users to put uploads in a home folder (i.e. a folder with a name unique to them), then you should check-out Amazon Cognito. With Cognito you'd use IAM policies containing variables that represent a Cognito User Id etc.
The last thing to remember is that an s3:PutObject can overwrite files, so keep this in mind when deciding where to allow users to upload to.
When an HTTP POST request is sent by the site visitor does the server know the file size [content-length] sent at the start of the request or does it have to get the whole file to get the REAL file size?
