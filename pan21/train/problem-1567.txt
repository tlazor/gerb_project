The RadCompression module was removed from the web application web.config file; however, the problem persisted. 
For troubleshooting,  the default ASP.Net website was created and deployed as a new website to IIS. The results were the same as the problematic website.
To find out the root cause as to why we are getting the error "An operation was attempted on a nonexistent network connection. (0x800704cd)" when we browse any web page after an idle time of minutes. This issue can occur due to multiple reasons and for the purpose of this ticket we will concentrate on only one root cause If the issue is caused by a Microsoft component, we will work diligently and efficiently to resolve this issue. If the cause of the issue is identified to be a third party or custom component, we will be happy to discuss our findings in detail and provide possible methods of resolution/workaround. It will ultimately be up to the third party vendor to resolve these types of issues.
I am experiencing a strange issue. I have an ASP.Net web application that users Form Authentication. If I open the log-in page and there is a couple of minutes of inactivity, the log-in attempt times out or IE / FireFox display "Cannot display this page". If there is no pause or lack of activity, there is no issue and the website run as expected. I enabled tracing in IIS. The area that appears to be hanging is NOTIFY_MODULE_START Module Name:ManagedPipelineHandler. After 132141 ms, I get the following error The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request. (0x800703e3) - ErrorCode 2147943395.
After two minutes of inactivity on any page on the web application, the page locks. You will see an Ajax loading panel ( aka spinning icon) for 120 seconds on your next action and then nothing. The application has locked.
The above components were not tested under a system load. If installed on a server operating system (such as ISA, proxy, mail server, terminal server, etc.) the components might cause issues with server communication. To avoid these issues it is not recommended to install the mentioned components on a server operating system. 
ErrorCode   The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request. (0x800703e3)
Note: This does not apply in case that you use the computer with some server operating system installed (e.g. Windows Server 2000, 2003 etc.) as a standard computer without the server features enabled.

At first, the issue apperared to be with Telrik. While loading up the Telerik.Web.UI.RadCompression on the REQUEST_ACQUIRE_STATE event, the following error was logged via IIS tracing:

The client had AVG Security workstation components installed on their servers. The workstation components caused communication issues with IIS. By disabling, Online Shield and Resident Shield the symptoms are no longer present.
