I only need this on a Windows 7 computer accessible only on a home network.  The site doesn't need to be accessible from the web.  I thought if I just added an entry to the host file like this 192.x.x.x:82 mypages that this would sufficient. But this was not. Seems to make sense that this could be the way to specify a name for that ip address. What are the proper steps?
The last step that you still may be missing is to add host header into site config, so IIS knows which site to refer to. In IIS Manager:
Adding host/domain name to hosts file is just first step. I usually use 127.0.0.1 IP if it only accessible from your own computer: 127.0.0.1 mypages.dev.
If you want to get rid of that ugly :82 in the URL, make the webserver on the local machine run on port 80. 
Other than specifying the host name in the host file for web site are there other steps needed to be able to refer to the site by that name instead of the ip address? I want to access the site like this
Someone talked about dns configuration.  I found a lot of technical definitions on google but so far no practical step by step instructions.  I have a windows 7 pc with iis.  Is there software I must install? where do I get it? What are the steps for resolving the name of that web site?
