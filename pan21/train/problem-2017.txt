I would use pfSense https://www.pfsense.org on both sides to establish an IPSec- or OpenVPN-Tunnel. pfSense is OSS, easy to use, and you can also buy specialised devices, professional support or even use it in a Hypervisor.
We use pfSense in a VMWare-Hypervisor to provide a Captive-Portal for our Guest-WiFi and it works very well. 
This example shows the configuration necessary for a seed and non-seed device for Cisco TrustSec switch-to-switch security. You must configure the AAA and RADIUS for link security. In this example, ACS-1 through ACS-3 can be any server names and cts-radius is the Cisco TrustSec server. 
A very minimal device is available at https://www.pfsense.org/products/ with two Ethernet-Ports for 150 US-$ each.
i could just attach network switches at both ends and create a flat L2 network. but i'd like to be sure that other tenants cannot easily tap into the cable and eavesdrop on the traffic passing between two of my offices.
with encrypted home-plug gear or wireless access points providing wpa2-psk - seems like the encryption hardware is available.
what solution would you propose here? ideally it should provide a transparent L2 connectivity and handle few hundreds of mbit/s. i'd prefer off-the-shelf devices that can be easily replaced. 
let's say i have two office spaces in a multi-tenant building. landlord was kind enough to provide me with copper cat 6 cable connecting both of the disjoint spaces.
