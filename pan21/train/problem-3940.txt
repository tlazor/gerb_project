However I have heard of people calling the Microsoft Activation hotline and getting it re-activated after moving to new hardware, I consider this social engineering.
True, Windows OEM software is tied to the original hardware it was either sold with or Installed on for life once the software has been activated.
I have never had to call MS Activation center to install or reinstall any of my OEM System builder Win7's. If fact its quite the opposite. I can install my OEM version on serveral machine at the same time and all of them will activate and update. I found this out when I wanted to see how my Vista laptop ran under win7 so I installed my desktop version. When I didnt have an activation issue I installed win7 on my htpc to see if it would trigger something; still no issues with it on any of the 3 systems. All have their own copies of win7 now btw; that was just a test that I did to see what MS would do which was nothing.
I have to say, unless you are in fact an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) it is already a violation of Microsoft's license terms to use OEM Windows. Just buy a regular retail license and you won't have to worry about any of this.
And OEM's like HP and Dells are even more restricted; allowing them to only be installed on a few models of motherboards.
