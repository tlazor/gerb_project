Unless you are actually using 5.6+-specific features, then mariadb is to all intents and purposes fully compatible.
Most things that 'require' mysql that I've run or installed, for some years now, seem to be entirely happy to use mariadb, and mariadb has an explicit intent to be a drop-in for the (now) Oracle MySQL. 
If you do need 5.6+ features, then I would suggest you check if your specific needs are supported (and possibly, assess the 'cost' of making some alterations). 
Unless you are concerned about support for code you specifically wrote for mysql 5.6+, then I don't think there is a compelling reason for avoiding mariadb (beyond personal taste and possibly support options). 
You don't mention what concerns you have about the switch, but I would suggest you at least consider re-assessing your fears about MariaDB - all else aside, you may find it makes your (operations') life easier to use your chosen distro's default choices than needing to deal with integrating alternatives. 
mysql-server-5.x will no longer be available and is replaced with mariadb-server-10.1. i don't feel i'm ready for the big step and moving to MariaDB, i'd prefer to stay with mysql 5.6 or - even better - 5.7. what would you recommend - using 5.7 from debian's unstable repository? going with the oracle-provided packages? some other options?
