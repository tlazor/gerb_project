I was surprised to see that my tablet immediately connected wireless to the AP behind the powerline and I could access the internet. (I gave that powerline a different SSID so I would know to which wireless AP I connected).
Got my new router and after setting it up I did some testing. I set the distant powerline with the garden AP up in a nearby socket, so I could easily bypass the powerline and connect the AP directly into the router.
As a sidenote, the issue only occurs when connecting wireless, If I would use a laptop and connnect with cable via the AP behind the powerlines, this always worked and the AP can also be accessed via a browser from anywhere in the network at all times. Just Wifi does not seem to work consistently when you pass through powerlines to the DHCP server. Booo! for that. I'll have to invest in putting a cable in the ground now ...
I could switch back to any other AP successfully, but the one behind powerlines doesn't want to work anymore. I reset the dhcp server, and indeed, it allowed me to connect again to the wireless AP behind the powerlines. tried another AP again with success but when going back to the one behind powerlines, I no longer received an IP. I removed the powerlines, connected that AP directly to the dhcp server, tried switching between the 3 wireless accesspoints and this worked like a charm.
Then when I switched back to the AP behind the powerlines the issue occurred again, just as before, the message 'obtaining IP address' stayed fixed until the tablet got tired of it and tried to connect to another wireless AP.
So I switched to another wireless AP and got immediately an IP address as I suspected. The ones that were directly connected with cable never gave me any issues.
