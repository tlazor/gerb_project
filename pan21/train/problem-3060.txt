Sounds like your PC is not resolving the domain properly. Make sure the DNS suffix list associated with the PC network card has "phoenix.domain.com" (and possibly "domain.com") included, and your domain login should work correctly.
If you have issues logging in with one or the other, I would check DNS settings on the workstation first (they should be pointed to the domain controller), and then start to delve into firewall issues.
