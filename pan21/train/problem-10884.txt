when i remove the directive datadir from my configuration file then mysql server starts but without loading the appropriate db data from my desired location.
i have two identical ubuntu machine on amazon servers. two of the machines have identical /etc/mysql configuration files. the problem is that when i unmount /elastidb (mysql data) on one server and remount it on the other, when i try to start mysql on the other server i get the following error:
I edited /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld, replacing all instances of '/var/lib/mysql' with '/opt/mysql'.

I want to be able to quickly move that mysql data storage from one machine to the other. what may be the problem ?
