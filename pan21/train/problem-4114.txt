If you are logged in as an Administrator your should be able to take ownership in the owner tab of that last screenshot and then change permissions.  Or, if this doesn't work, you could download a Linux boot CD and access the files that way.
I had the same issue except I wasn't able to see the Security tab at all when accessing the properties of the disk. I managed to lock myself out of it (being my laptop's only hard disk) when I tried to resize the C:\ logical disk (stupidly, admittedly ;)) but managed to corrupt it, to which Check Disk fixed it but buggered the NTFS permissions.
I found that TakeOwn does work on logical drives, but you have to be careful about what syntax you declare in the command prompt. You wrote in your screenshot "J:\", drop the "\" and TakeOwn will pick up the drive.
This above instruction will change onwership for all of the folders and files from the specified full path and all subfolders and files. The /c tells the tool to continue on error, so that it can process all it can.
Using the command-line prompt with the Icacls instruction might help also, just to let you know. I have tried it already, no later than lastnight, and worked quite well.
