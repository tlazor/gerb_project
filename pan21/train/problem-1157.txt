If you move a window slowly towards (or do a brief stop close to) the edge between your two screens, your chances that Windows will think that you want to snap that window are high. Then it will block your cursor "to help you".
The reason you are being "blocked" is because Windows now has "Aero Snap" which, allows any [native] window to be snapped to an edge of the screen. The Aero Snap feature cannot work properly if there is no blocking.
So to circumvent this problem, Microsoft decided that it would be best to block the blocking only if the cursor was exceeding a certain "speed".
If you move your window more quickly you won't have this behaviour and you'll barely notice the small circle that is displayed when snapping.
Recently upgraded to Windows 10. When I attempt to grab the title bar of a window and drag it to another monitor - I have two side-by-side monitors - Windows frequently prevents it. It appears like Windows thinks that I want to "snap" the window to the side of the origin monitor and won't let my mouse cursor cross the boundary to the destination monitor.
Also, could you please clarify something for me.  In your screenshot, to the left of it, there is an open window which appears to be snapped. That window is on your left monitor right? Is it snapped to the right side of your left monitor? If so, and if you are not dragging the window very slowly, this might actually be a bug.
