If that query returns any results, the assumption being made is that the database is in a suspect or potentially bad state.
In Ola Hallengren's blog  (an SQL MVP), in his tool to verify the database integrity, I found he's using the view sys.database_recovery_status to query a db status. If the db has a row in this view, then it's live and kicking, if not, it's offline.
Rather than query for specific conditions, I'd take a look at anything in sys.databases where state_desc <> 'ONLINE'.  Also, depending on what you're looking to do, has_dbaccess might throw some false positives.
I want to be able to run a query to get the crucial information about a database's status. I.e., I want the query to be able to tell what whether or not the database is in a good state. 
PS: the databaseproperty function that you use is going to be removed in future versions, so databasepropertyex is replacing it.
Remember that databases participating in mirroring or log shipping will not be online or may change state regularly. For more info about the sys.databases DMV see documentation here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178534.aspx
If you're using SQL 2005+ and only want to return the DB name where the DB isn't in the "ONLINE" state I'd use this:
the way that I found to see the db status is to use the function DATABASEPROPERTYEX ( database , property ), like this:
