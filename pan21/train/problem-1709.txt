I have a fairly long powerpoint presentation where I use different sections, hyperlinks between them and animations on each slide (roughly 60 in total). Depending on the person I'm talking to I hide some slides while showing others. Sometimes when I skip to the next slide the person listening asks me to go back a few slides. The process of going back a few slides is not really difficult as you only press the left arrow key (or page up or whatever), but it doesn't look professional when you have to press it 6 times to go backwards (or forward) through the animations that many of the slides have.
This is most likely a fairly simple question but I could not find any answers when I looked around (might be just me who is not really good at googling).
Suppose that I am 2 animations in into a 7 animation slide and I want to directly skip ahead to the next slide; is there a way to, with one keyboard command, skip the remaining 5 animations on the current slide and go to the next one? I want to be able to continue through PPT slides without going through every single animation, on the fly (if this is possible).
