Your download may also be slower due to congested pipes upstream of your ISP, or even within your ISP's network.  If your ISP has 200 clients connected at 10Mbps, but only has a 1Gbps uplink to the internet then if all the clients are on at one time they'll only be able to use half their nominal bandwidth before the ISP's uplink is saturated.  In practice this kind of oversubscription generally works well, because you usuallu don't have everyone on at the same time,but the effect can be noticeable during peak times.
All protocols, including TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, etc introduce some overhead to the process.  So if you're downloading a file, and measuring the rate at which you're receiving the file (in KBytes/sec), you need to add the TCP/IP and layer 2 overheads, as well as the overhead of any higherlevel protocol in play (HTTP, FTP, etc) in order to get to the actual bit-rate.
And having said all that, the numbers you're quoting mean you're hitting about 89% of your nominal bandwidth without taking any protocol overhead into consideration.  That's a pretty good figure.  
The speed of your ADSL connection is a maximum that in practice you will very rarely achieve.  There are numerous reasons for this.  
Another consideration is the speed at which the server your downloading from is connected to the Internet.  If you've got a 10Mbps connection but the server at the other end only has 5Mbps you'll never achieve more than 5Mbps (and probably less) downloading from that server unless there's some caching involved in between.  And the same congestion consideration is at play as well if it's a popular server that hasn't sized its connections (or caching) well for the level of traffic it gets.
