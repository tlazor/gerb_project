In the AWS management console you can also activate the terminate protection to avoid mistakes: right click on an instance and choose "Change Termination Protection".
Then I did the same thing again above. This time I created and registered the AMI before shutting it down. But every update after creating new AMI is lost.
Everytime I update a file or other configuration, I don't want to register and create a new AMI. That seems tedious and inefficient. Why do they call this EBS if everything is lost after terminating the instance? Am I doing something wrong? Is it possible to create a persistent AMI without need to register new image every time you update a file?
You would need to re-create the AMI if you want it to contain your updates. Or a better method would be to build your AMI so that it pulls new configs/code when it boots up. You should look at 'user-data'.
Never terminate your instance if you don't want to lose the root EBS: stop it instead. You won't be charged any fee for the instance, since it's not running, but of course you'll still pay for the Gb of disk space allocated.
I created EC2 instance using one of Amazon's Linux EBS Backed AMI. I updated and added http server and python. I noticed the EBS AMI has been added to the EBS Volume. Then I terminated the EC2 instance to continue my work some other time, once I terminated, everything was gone. The EBS Volume and all the changes that I made. Confused why EBS volume is gone? How this is persistent?
The EBS volume connected to the running EC2 instance will be deleted when you perform 'terminate'. Instead a 'stop' will keep everything intact.
