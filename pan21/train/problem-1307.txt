We have contractors working for us that use Outlook 2010 to connect with their client e-mail accounts and keep calendars organized - we have lost this ability.   Some users have gone two days without e-mails being delivered before they noticed and no errors AT ALL were reported.
I am using Google sync between outlook 2010 64 bit and google apps premier addition without any problem. It's a life saver for me!
We have had nothing but problems with our Google Apps e-mail migrations to Outlook 2010.  Here is a short list of the most serious problems:  (1) Can't have an exchange server e-mail connection alongside Google Apps e-mail and have Google Apps still send e-mail in Outlook 2010.  (2) Some users with just a Google Apps e-mail address in their profile appear to send e-mail which "vanishes" mysteriously - no Sent Items, no Drafts, no Outbox - just "poof"!  (3) strange "from" in e-mails to groups.  (4) Problems with sharing of calendar information.  (5) events/meetings that appear in calendars without any "invite".  (6) Problems with sync failing or hanging up Outlook.
All I can say is that Outlook 2010 integration is still seriously BETA and has numerous critical issues that are not yet resolved.  I would not recommend a migration at this time if anyone is considering it.
I am a college student, and I use outlook 2010 for my primary email, however, my school uses a gmail account for our college email.  This account isn't even truly gmail, it's a google application for email and so I am having trouble adding my college email to outlook.  Does anyone know what the incoming mail server would be for this? I'm truly stumped...
