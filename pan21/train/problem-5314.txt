This is not a total answer, but it seems vim keeps separate # and % buffers for each window. So you can alternate between two files quickly in one window (using CTRL-^) and two different files in the other window. The buffer list is still all the buffers you have added though. 
Perhaps, you could make a plugin that gives you commands to allow switching to the previous/next buffers of the same type as the file of the current buffer in the current window.
I've a screen shot of working with Workspace manager with 4+ windows posted on my fb, you can view it there (which is public).
But do you really want permanent window management in vim?  PuTTY connection manager and all sorts of terminal emulators let you split the terminals how you want, and then run separate vim sessions in each.
One quick way to open a buffer of a specific file is to use FuzzyFinder's :FufBuffer command. It'll open a list of all opened buffers (excluding the one in your current window) for easy access. I've got mine bound to ,fn. It would allow me to, for example, quickly see all css files with ,fncss or all js files with ,fnjs. FuzzyFinder is great for getting to that file/buffer/directory/etc you want with minimal effort (not just this particular use case).
Why shoehorn that level of window management into vim?  I do occasionally use split windows - I have Ctrl-F mapped to a find-in-files style grep command that appears in a split window, and I also use vimdiff on occasion.
However, i suspect you're looking for something which will allow you to use :bn and :bN (or whatever you have those mapped to, cannot remember if ctrl-n/p are default or my custom) to switch between your buffers of a specific file type.
It's not exactly a list of buffers as you wanted it, but you can open files in different windows, and in multiple buffers in same window.
