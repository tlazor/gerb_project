With the certification route, you may find some of these topics are lightly covered or delayed to an advanced course.  So may be better just to pick and choose the topics you need.  
Unless you need certification for career development purposes, I would focus more on gaining the practical knowledge needed to manage your operations.  With Red Hat training and certification, there is a lot of information that you will never use in managing web operations.  
There is far more but this is a check list we use when hiring new sysadmins to support our clients who run various web operations.  
LinuxCBT are the KING of learning about linux system administration, after that comes LPIC training material.
I would say that internet is full of resources on LAMP. There are plenty of tutorials available on same and I would recommend you to go through it. With respect to LAMP or most of the Linux technologies, you not only need to learn the right thing but you also need to know how to avoid the wrong actions. Most of the paid courses fail to address the latter case. Just go on youtube and see some videos on LAMP. Read out a few tutorials and you would be good to go. 
Not a "how to do" book but will give you a good ideal of the scope of what web ops management entails.  You can then pick the parts you want to take on yourself and outsource the rest.
I would setup a development system that is a clone of your production environment and use it for testing and training.
