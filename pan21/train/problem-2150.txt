Your top level domain's name servers are generally owned, operated, and managed by the top level domain's registry.
* The root name server information is owned by ICANN under contract given by the US Department of Commerce, managed by VeriSign in collaboration with ICANN, and operated by many different organizations across the globe.
No matter which option you choose, the delegation information (i.e. telling the world which name servers are authoritative for your domain's DNS based on the approach you take) is passed from your registrar to the top level domain's (.com, .net, .us, .de, etc.) registry.
When you register a domain name, you do so through a registrar such as godaddy.  You usually (depending on the registrar) have a few options for how the DNS authoritative for your domain is handled:
All the DNS servers don't interact with each other. No DNS server will be "updated" with your DNS information. DNS is a pull technology, not a push technology. The only way my DNS servers know about your DNS records is if they (or one of their DNS clients) submits a query for one of your DNS records. Then my DNS servers submit a query to find your name server(s), using forwarders or root hints, and then based on that answer, query your name servers for the record in question. At no other time does my DNS server know anything about your domain DNS records.
