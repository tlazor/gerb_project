You want to change the PromptOnSecureDesktop setting to 0.  The Local Policy Editor can change that, but that's only available on Vista Business or "better".  However, the registry setting can be changed regardless of Vista flavour.

I presume the problem is related to how your graphics card or driver handles screen switches.  From your description, it seems to be not handling it that well.  By default, UAC on Vista will do a screen switch to the "secure desktop" when asking for consent.  It is possible to switch OFF the secure desktop switch, while still having UAC enabled.
Save this to a file with a .REG extension, and double click it, which will cause the Registry Editor to apply the setting.
In closing, "Quiet Mode" from TweakUAC was the best solution providing a non intrusive UAC authentication for Vista if the registry tweaks for PromptOnSecureDesktop failed.  If you're stuck with lesser Vista Home editions and such I'd recommend this approach as UAC is still active for you.  In my case I upgraded machine to Windows 7 and I have no further issues.
