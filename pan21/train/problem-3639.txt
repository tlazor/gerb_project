I would simply like to replicate my Mac's screen on to my TV in the hallroom. This way I can play anything I want and it will show up on my TV. 
I have a 32" TV in the hallroom nearby. I can attach the output of my Pi, through HDMI to my TV. Now all I need to do is stream the video content from my Mac, to my TV through the Pi. Both my Pi and Mac are connected to the same Wifi network. The Pi is connected wirelessly too, if that helps. Both rooms are nearby as well, very with both the Mac and the Pi also close to the wifi router.
the best approach would be to share the folder with the movies using NFS or SAMBA and access it from Pi to read the contents and play it on the TV screen.
i am using the same setup using xbmc, now kodi. i have a synology nas as multimedia and file server. in kodi i have mapped the share, it's quite easy, all you need to know is a bit of basic networking. the player will then take care of everything, and works great with 1080p as well, no lag or choppy playback. i also recommend a subtitle addon
still, 1080p movies might play choppy during the action scenes because of wifi speed not being fast enough to support the necessary bandwidth. you might need to use the wired ethernet as the last resort.
I have a collection of movies (Please note: Mostly 1080p) on my external hard disk drive. This drive is attached to my PC (Mac). The external hard disk also contains some important work files, hence I will not be able to detach it from my Mac.
