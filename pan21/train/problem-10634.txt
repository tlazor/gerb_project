The terminology and symbology originated with networking diagrams where unknown, undefined networks beyond the control and scope of the network diagram (typically the internet at large) were diagrammed as a cloud, so its usage with regards to computers is fairly similar.  It can, and often does involve virtualization, but you can have physical servers "hosted in the cloud" and even managed by a "cloud service provider" if you wish.
Regarding scaling and virtualization... I don't know, you're just so far off-base that I really don't know where to even begin.
Cloud computing is simply computing in the cloud.  Again, virtualisation not required, although it is a common example.  You can also have apps run as a service eg. Google App Engine
'The Cloud' is a vague term which doesn't require virtualisation of any sort.  It simply refers to your data or service residing somewhere out there in the internet in one or multiple places, you don't care where but that it is accessible from anywhere.
So people have started using the terms of private cloud or their own cloud which is wrong because it is mixing concepts but since when did management speak need to make any sense?  This is more than simply virtualisation where you might have hardware dedicated to types of machines and you might present VMs as an online machine to your users, but the idea of setting up a generic platform that is presented to another business role to manage VMs on (although that could be you wearing a different hat)  The implication that you can adapt, fire up clones, test machines, change hardware, etc. more easily.
