It sounds like your company has taken the appropriate measures to secure wireless access, namely a vpn endpoint and no direct internal routing. However its relatively easy to setup a wireless access point with only specific routes and specific firewall rules and based on their current setup I would suspect that they would be able to do this although there would be security concerns that are not easily removed. 
Pretty much any commercial/enterprise wireless access point will work ( in contrast to a WAP or WAP Router for home), with a firewall sitting right behind it. In the simplest case you could cross connect a WAP to a linux host's network adapter and do all of your ip forwarding / host filtering on that machine. This is cheap and very easy to implement, probably less than half an hour to get working. I wouldn't recommend going all the way and putting a linux machine in AP mode, there can be a lot of complexity in getting that to work correctly, its must easier to use an external third party AP unless you have very specific experiments you are doing and wish to have fine grained control over beacon intervals or other such wireless protocol level details.
