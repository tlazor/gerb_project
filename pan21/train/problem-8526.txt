Your original approach of creating a full clone of the sda drive could also work (although it's not very efficient). But on the new server you have to manually create the partitions on the 2nd drive and then add them to the RAID arrays to start the re-sync.
However, if you want to go the dd way, the idea is to create/restore an image of each RAID device rather than the underlying disks or partitions. You would also have to create an image of the boot/partition area of each disk. To restore the backup, you boot the target system with a "live" Linux system (e.g. http://www.system-rescue-cd.org/), then restore the boot/partition areas, create and assemble the RAID devices and finally restore the backup images to the RAID devices.
Anyway, IIUC you want to have a kind of template for your servers. I would suggest to use kickstart with install option with liveimg parameter - this way you could create an image with all your files which would be "populated" into your new installed server during kickstart-based unattended installation.
To create similar servers with an unattended installation, you should look into kickstart like the other answers suggest.

If you do not want to have 100% equal machines, just use kickstart with nfs or url parameter pointing to either public Centos repo or your mirror.
