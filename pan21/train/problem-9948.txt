You haven't assigned a user ID number (what dscl calls UniqueID) to the _jira user, and since file ownership is recorded by user ID, there's no way to chown files to an account without one. Add something like:
If you want to stick with adding a secondary membership in the _jira group, you should assign some other group ID as the primary, and then add the secondary membership with dseditgroup:
So I am attempting to create a new user and group, and then change ownership of a directory to that new user/group. However, when I do, chown comes back with an "illegal user name" message.
Note: I can list all the existing users and groups and can see the _jira user and _jira group, and also see that the user is assigned to that group.
This not only adds "_jira" to the group's GroupMembership list, it also adds the user's UUID to the group's GroupMembers list -- doing both is recommended, and while it's possible to do with dscl it's simpler with dseditgroup.
You should also set the user's PrimaryGroupID, and I'd use that to assign it to the _jira group rather than adding the user to the group:
