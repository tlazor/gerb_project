First, try setting up some sort of "coding hangout time" - you and her can practice coding together. You can help her when she gets stuck, and encourage her. It's always good to have a buddy in what you're doing =)
I am not sure if I agree with the "monkey" part! Maybe everyone is capable of writing some code. Building serious apps is another thing...
Programming is really an another world. The Logic and the choosing of correct language and method matters. Smartness is a plus but not necessary.
Second, start with the right things. Try a little visual programming first, using hour of code programs, or a language like Python, which will teach good practice (indentation, etc) and remove worries like memory control, which make it harder for new learners.
Anyway, show her the code.org website, and let her play around for a while. If she does not like, then probably she is not fitted for this "monkey thing" :)
Third, start small. The classic hello world program in Python is literally print("Hello world!"). From there, maybe go to things like adding, or using variables. I particularly enjoy Codecademy's course - problems with instructions. And remind her that you'll be willing to help when you have time, and so will people on sites like stack exchange (Codecademy also has a forum, though I haven't really used it).
