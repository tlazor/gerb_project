That's some pretty bad luck. There is no way to continue a download from where you left off. Apple doesn't want the download to get corrupted, so they redownload every time. You could try going to Settings-->General-->Software Update on your iPad, and download the update from there. I'm not sure if it will help though. Otherwise, I would suggest going somewhere with Wifi (Mcdonalds or something) and doing what I said above on your iPad itself. 
I have an iPad 2, and I would like to update to iOS 6. But every time I pause the download in iTunes, the download gets reset to zero kB. I don't have a stable internet connection, so it's impossible for me to get that download in one go. Why does iTunes keep cancelling the download instead of actually pausing it, and what can I do to upgrade iOS on this iPad. I'm running iTunes on Windows XP but the same failures are occurring on 7 as well.
Scroll down to iOS 6 and pick the corresponding iPad. Also, the difference between an iPad Wifi  and a iPad(2,4) is that iPad(2,4) should have come preloaded with iOS 5.1. So in this case you want iPad 2 Wifi.
