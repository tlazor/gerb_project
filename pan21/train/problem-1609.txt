There is a lot of DNS caching these days, in the OS and many applications. It insulates ISPs from a lot of there intermitent problems. But nothing will work more consistently and robustly than an actually DNS server.
My observation is that the very large providers have a tendency to neglect DNS servers. The reason is pretty obvious, when you have a large number of less sophisticated end users, they are not going to accurately detect and describe problems with the DNS server. Most of them do not know what DNS server is. Then you call tech support, and you find out they do not know what a DNS server is either!
When I had a provider with a bad DNS server, annoying things would happen like: lookup an address. It fails. Try again, it works. The server also seemed to have a variable length of time to respond to the same query. That made me think the entire service offering was pointing to a non-load balanced IP, or that the subnet was congested and losing packets.
If you are getting broadband on a very large provider (cable or phone company), you should configure your own caching DNS server, especially if you have never done it. Consider it a learning opportunity :) Or if you actually want a network that works without filling in the infrastructure gaps, get off the big vendor.
