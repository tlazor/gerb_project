http://www.richweb.com/nginx or simply search on google /ask your sys admin. As you use Zend framework you might also consider Zend Server http://www.zend.com/en/products/server/ 
Another suggestion is that, if you application tends to scale in the future, you might consider testing the same setup you have on amazon EC2 http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
For immediate assistance in your case only a sysadmin can help you. If you want to hire one you might consider https://www.odesk.com but again you need to select a reliable one with very good feedback. If you want just a consultancy without having the admin to enter your server I am sure that you can find several ones available at very reasonable rates (20/30$ an hour) to give your some feedback. 
This might sound as a random suggestion not addressing your problem but, from personal experience, sometimes having the possibility to scale becomes essential as your business grow. 
Hello Unfortunately It is difficult to find an immediate solution to your problem especially without a sys admin. This said I think that you can at least solve (on the long run) the memory hungry apache -as it seems from your relic report - with a nginx + apache + php to scale up the speed of your app considerably 
Sorry if these ideas seems a bit generic and do not solve your immediate problem but, over the long term, this could provide you with a good solution.
