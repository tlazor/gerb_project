For this kind of issue, I believe MS Excel tries to access the default printer when opening the document (I had a file in MS Excel 365 set in Page break preview, under the View menu). My default printer had been set to a shared printer from a retired PC, so I guess MS Excel was trying to contact the printer in vain, and hanging at this point. Solution is to change the default printer to a reachable/local printer, and possibly remove/delete the offending printer from control panel. After this, the workbook opens without issue
Just had this happen to me and although the first answer is quite helpful another possible solution  (the one I actually used) is to do the following.
Problem for me was that I'm working off network, so when this particular document tries to access the printer it fails and hangs up - did as the original poster answered himself and set the default to XPS and it works perfectly.
Changed the default printer to the XPS document writer and the problem was resolved. I therefore uninstalled his previous default printer and removed the driver through Print Management, then reinstalled it. The problem was resolved.
