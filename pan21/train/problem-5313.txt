Next I booted to the recovery mode only to find out that none of the recovery points work, the automatic repair also didn't help and so I had to perform system reset.
I reinstalled Cortana, checked indexing options, deleted related registry entry and rebuild index with no results, so I decided to let it go seeing as it was not that much of an issue.
The windows reinstalled while keeping all my files and settings and everything went to normal. I check hard drive and memory for errors and all tests were passed with no problems, except that the search function ignored icons in Star menu. 
About a week ago I got Machine check exception when I was starting my Windows 10 machine (HPE-420cs), the progress remained stuck at 0% for several hours and no error code was provided. 
After waiting cca 3hrs I restarted PC using hardware button, since the PC didn't respond to any other way of commanding it. 
I have been running tests since then from UBCD, memtest and CPU stress tests came out all clear. Right now I am testing the hard drive again but so far I found no errors and I doubt there will be any.
I started using the PC again only for the error to return today, again only factory reset option solved the issue and allowed me to enter Windows.
The windows is, more or less, cleanly installed and looking for help online turned out nothing. And since Windows does not display detailed error message I am left with guess work.
