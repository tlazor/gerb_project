Windows 8 is essentially Windows 7 with the addition of a tiled start screen (it was primarily developed for use with tablet touchscreens as opposed to desktops). If you want to learn all that the tiled start screen has to offer (and there is a lot to learn) it may well prepare you for future versions of Windows in years to come. If you don't then do not upgrade to Windows 8, stick with Windows 7
Personally, my favorite changes are the improved task manger, a small speed boost, faster bootup and the new  "corners" interface. It doesn't really feel like that large of a difference between 7 and 8.
I have found that with my power settings set to always on, I have about 40% more life on the same laptop when running in Windows 8 over my Windows 7 install. I went as far as doing time tests on battery life while surfing the web and writing some code, and popped back in the old Win 7 drive and confirmed the battery life difference.
Honestly, there is no reason to switch to windows 8 if you are not doing it for the new interface and windows 8 app store.
Being a developer myself my requirements are less fancy then a "normal" user. I need a system to be stable. And windows 7 does that job fine.
