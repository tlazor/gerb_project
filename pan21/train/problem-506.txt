Is such a thing possible with IKEv2? As far as I can tell, it was possible through Xauth in IKEv1. But for IKEv2 I'm not so sure: on a cursory read of RFC 5996, section 2.16, it seems this may not be the case. Username & password authentication would happen through some EAP method, and:
I have a test setup where the responder authenticates itself with a self-signed certificate. The initiator authenticates with a username and password.
Short of deploying a proper PKI, I'd prefer to perform mutual authentication of the initiator and responder hosts through a PSK. This key would be securely distributed to all users. Outside attackers would not have the PSK and so a weak or compromised password is insufficient for access. The username & password authentication allows identification and authorization of a specific user against an existing directory system, without the need for generating and distributing unique keys for each user.
Although the question is about the IKEv2 protocol, I intend to implement the responder end with strongswan, so any additional expertise there would be appreciated.
