No other fixes were successful other than simply uninstalling the Salesforce for Outlook plugin at this time.
I have found this on microsoft site that it was saying that it could be a configured compatibility issue or else the check the date and time. If you can't able to clear this issue check out this link http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/cannot-set-up-micsosoft-outlook-2013-on-new-pc/8429012f-96f1-4536-98f8-a1f9cd92787a?db=5&auth=1
If the other solutions such as outlook.exe /safe, Creating a new Outlook Profile and Renaming the Profile key in the registry don't work, try the following.  
Also, you need to kill the running process for Salesforce for Outlook, as the uninstaller has issues accessing it.
Check the versions of MAPI32.DLL in c:\windows\system32 and c:\windows\sysWow64 and make sure they are the correct ones for the Outlook version you are trying to run.  I had a user that had this issue after installing Office 365 Pro Plus (2016) on a system that had Office 2010 installed and the install never updated the files.  After copying the newer files from a system with a working Outlook 2016 install, this resolved the issue.
