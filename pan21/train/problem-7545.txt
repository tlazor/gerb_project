If you really need this to work, the solution is to connect 192.168.10.253 to 10.10.10.2 and create a route. How you do this depends on the nature of the two boxes. If they're servers they might have a second network port you can connect up (and configure appropriately). If they don't have a second network interface then you are probably out of luck without completely changing your network configuration. My suggestion, as you are probably in a bit of an XY problem, is to post a new question describing what you need to achieve, not how you are trying to achieve it.
The first two commands tell the firewall to allow traffic to flow between the two private subnets, and the third command does the same at the kernel level. You need both. 
You do not need another route to allow users of the private subnets to communicate. You only need the following commands:
As per your network diagram, there is no physical link from the 192.168.10.253 device to the 10.10.10.0/24 network so there is no way on Earth you should expect to get a response when you ping 10.10.10.2 out of eth1. The only way to ping 10.10.10.2 successfully is for the ping request to go out of eth2.
