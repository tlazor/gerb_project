Hopefully, you're tracking your static IP address assignments somehow.  Most shops have some type of document (like a spreadsheet) that keeps track of any static assignments.  If you don't, there are free IP address managers available on the Internet (SolarWinds comes to mind), that can help you inventory what you have on your network.
As for static address clients that connect after your IP inventory, they will receive an address conflict notification when they rejoin the network, if their address is already in use.  Hopefully, they'll have the sense to switch over to DHCP (or call support).  Unfortunately, you have to apply more sophisticated techniques (such as network access protection or 802.1x) to prevent these guys from connecting in the first place.
As far as DHCP assignments go, if you're using the Windows DHCP server, you can enable address conflict detection so that it will ping an address to see if it is in use before assignment.  I think other DHCP servers have similar capability.  Of course, your client and hardware firewalls must allow pings for this feature to work.
