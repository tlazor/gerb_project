To use 1000Base-T modules at 1Gb/s you also need Cat 5e or Cat 6 ethernet cable else there is no guarantee that this will work at 1Gb/s.
The medium, twisted pairs of copper wire in this case, has certain properties that have inherent limitations due to electromagnetism.  This is a large subject, but a simple search will yield a lot of results.  Basically, you have external and internal noise that will degrade the signal.  The longer the run, the worse it is, and this problem gets worse at higher bandwidths.
It becomes a tradeoff: it is better to specify a fixed length and increase the speed rather than keep the speed the same and increase the length.
it is nothing to do with signal degradation is to do with physical propertiy of a signal across the wire. The length is exactly 100 metres as (doing the maths) anything over 100m will be long enough for an ethernet device to transmit a frame and not hear the collission detect back-ff from the far end. so anything over 100m will be subject to late-collisions.
Also a 1Gb/s link uses all 8 wires in the cable where as a 100Mb/s link only uses 4, in case you have some wires damaged inside the cable it might work well at 100 Mb/s but not at 1Gb/s.
The 100 meter limitation comes from physics and the installed base of cabling.  One hundred meters is a convenient length due to legacy specifications (10Base-T and 100Base-TX) since the installed cable base was already limited to 100 meters (CSMA/CD, as you pointed out, limited 10Base-T to 100 meters). You may have noticed that every twisted-pair standard strives to meet the 100 meter length for this reason.
