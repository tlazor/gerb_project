Yes, if the cable is a crossover cable. Otherwise you'd need a switch of some kind. Some NIC's autosense and can switch over for you, or you can get a device that "adapts" the connection for you. Otherwise make your own cable with the crossover wiring.
I ask because it's not working for me and I'm not getting very useful search results. If someone can confirm that this should indeed work then I can check and re-check the system settings and specifications.
If two computers are connected by ethernet directly (ie, with no router between them) can one computer wake the other using the magic packet?
Shut down the computer that needs to go down/wake up. If the network-light on the back is still burning while the computer is off you are good to go.
(On Windows make sure in the device properties of the LAN card that "This device may wake the computer" is enabled.)
Auto-negotiate is only properly defined for computer to switch connections using standard (non-crossover) cables. The Gigabit standards adds support for cross-over cables and automatic cross-over when needed, but only if BOTH sides of the connection are Gigabit.
