Simply specify which local IP the rule applies to, and fill out the rest of the options as you navigate the wizard.
I currently circumvent this issue by allowing the application on all adapters but only from a certain source network. However this network might change in the future whereas the TAP's name might not.
It will open up more options, including Scope in which you can designate which IP range you want to allow traffic into.
When creating your firewall rule in Windows using the Inbound / outbound rule Wizard, check the Custom Rule button.
I want to allow an application on a Windows 7 Professional System to only be accessible through the OpenVPN TAP adapter by configuring the Windows Firewall accordingly.
Unfortunately I cannot find an option therefor. I found out that it is possible to allow applications on certain NIC-types, but the OpenVPN adapter is recognized as an Ethernet adapter and I do not want the application to be accessible through ethernet adapters other than the TAP adapter.
