I have a windows laptop (hp elitebook), and I use my wireless bluetooth mac keyboard with it.  Because the keyboard shortcuts do not translate well from windows to Mac, I want to remap them.  I can either 1) remap the keys on the windows machine, such that the bluetooth mapping is what I desire, or 2) remap the keys on the bluetooth wireless keyboard.  
I even tried editting the .klc file, which is what this guy suggested, but I found it very difficult to edit the .klc files for my purpose.  The klc files can be downloaded using the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, and the codes for the keys can be found here.  But , even still I do not know how to edit it to allow combations of keys, again it seems like it is only good for one to one.  
Let's say, for example I want to map the cntrl+W to Windows key+W.  I can't just map Cntrl to Windows key, because I need the cntrl key for other things.  I want to map the combination to another combination.
I tried Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, which looked promising, but in the layout interface, there is no windows key (strange, since it came from Microsoft).
To avoid the XY problem, I'll explain my problem and then the problem I have with my attempted solutions:
