They just added new features for what the OS can do with them, older system's will simply not know what to do with it and will essentially treat it as a part of the file that's simply never asked for by an application - except for the rare situation of extremely large filesystems and file-names, older computers will usually see them but be unable to rename, delete, or move some files, or possibly have trouble booting from it. Old OS's might not add the redundant Master File Tables, so a Pre-XP version of windows or an old *nix version would only use the Primary - but the File System starts out the same when it's empty of data (and running chkdsk will make the necessary backup entry copies). Just don't use windows server file data dedup on it in windows or the other OS might not read parts of some files. any other Questions? 
So I'm reinstalling a whole system, which has Linux and Windows, and I'm making a "shared" NTFS partition to hold data for both.
Thing is, would affect anything if I setup the partitioning scheme from Gparted before installing Windows?
Say, differences in versions. I believe NTFS changed a bit between Windows XP and Windows Vista for example, what kind of NTFS does Gparted creates? Or they're all the same? Or does it varies depending on the NTFS-3G version?
(You can always review this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS - and if there's anything you find that you have a question/worry/concern about ask away!)
Gparted can make NTFS partitions just fine via NTFS-3G, but I don't know if the partition would be exactly as what Windows would create with its partition manager.
