The above response is rather generic, but without the exact made and model of the card it is hard to be much more specific.
That seems rather high to me for "idle". What is the ambient temperature in the room the machine is in?
You should check the documentation (or ask on the manufacturer's support forum or similar) to see what that light indicates. This info may tell you exactly what the problem is.
It could be overheat, or it could perhaps be that it has detected a lock condition. If this is the case and it is a common fault in the card's firmware then there may be a firmware update for the card that will fix the issue (again, refer to the manufacturer as the first port of call for this info).
One of my older cards came with software that added readings of temperature, memory use, and various speed/activity readings and such as an on-screen overlay - it might be worth looking into software like that and keeping an eye on the temperature reading so you know what it is before rebooting not after. If you run two or more monitors it might be easier to find software that you can run on the second screen rather than as an overlay. Or better still, see if you can find something that logs the temperature reading then you have the data even after a full lock and reboot.
What info are you using to derive this estimate? If you are taking a temperature reading after rebooting then that could be on the low side as once activity stops the temperature can fall quicker than you'd expect, and rebooting Windows can take a minute or few.
