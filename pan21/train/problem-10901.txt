It's just a question of budget to buy and connect 1 petabyte of storage. Or 10 petabyte. Or 100. Or ...
However, you don't usually hook up that much storage to a single node. Due to availability and scalability concerns, large storage capacities are routinely shared between a large number of nodes or VMs. All current enterprise storage technologies allow sharing, and the distinction between direct-attached storage and network storage is more one of implementation rather than technology.
Nearly all kinds of current storage protocols can offer virtually unlimited storage. The physical size might quickly exceed a single server's case capacity but you can extend the physical installation to additional rack shelves or even complete racks. The magic word is SAN (storage area network).
"When a dataset outgrows the storage capacity of a single physical machine, it becomes necessary to partition it across a number of separate machines."
So is there a limitation on amount of storage capacity a single physical machine can have ? I think this question falls in 'Computer Architecture', but I haven't read this subject and I am curious to know why is there a limitation. Why can't 1 physical machine potentially has 1 petabyte of data ?
