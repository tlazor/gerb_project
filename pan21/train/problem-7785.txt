You can have dedicated inbound IP addresses if you set up SSL, but that won't help on your outbound IP need.
Azure Websites is website-as-a-service. As such, it's a very large multi-tenant service without dedicated outbound IP addresses. Even if you use your own VMs (e.g. when running Standard as you are currently doing). True, all of your websites are running on reserved VMs, but... your traffic still gets routed through the service itself.
To answer your question on locking the IP: You'd need to originate your external API call from either a web/worker role instance in a Cloud Service, or from a Virtual Machine, either of which has a static VIP. Note that, if you actually tear down the deployment, you're at risk of losing the assigned IP address (though with Virtual Machines you can shut down and ask for the IP to remain allocated). Also, you now have an option of assigning a non-changing VIP to a deployment.
There are several ways to have your website communicate with a web/worker instance or virtual machine, which I consider out of scope for this question, but you should easily be able to find a bunch of info on queues, vnets, etc.
