If you do intend to have more possible enemies or players that you can't imagine right now, then you should definitely break it up. What you're describing in your second point is basically the state pattern.
edit: actually, for your stationary enemies, rather than restricting the movement component, just give them a stationary AI component that never chooses to move them.
For the player I don't think it needs to be completely separate. It can still use all the other components, with the addition of an input component. This component drives the transitions between states, whereas in the enemy it's controlled by a default AI, or if you want, different AI subclasses that your enemy designers can choose from.
I think I agree with Gregory that you shouldn't have separate stand and walk state components. It's just a movement component with speed 0. On the other hand, if you have objects that can't move, you either have to split it up, or just put some kind of boolean restriction in the movement state that prevents having non zero velocity.
