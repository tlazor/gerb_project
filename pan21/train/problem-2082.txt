Make sure that your root hints are up to date by checking them with IANA's copy here: http://www.internic.net/zones/named.root
Also another problem I find with OpenDNS is that if you ping a machine that doesn't actually exist on your network, it'll still return a ping as if it existed -- it's just resolving their dns server. You know when you type in fcebook.com or gogle.com, it goes to their servers? Same w/ pinging.
I agree also with Gekkz, use 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 - I have used dns in many business and home set ups, while it is useful - I still don't like that it hijacks google searches.
This is not exact answer to your question, but I have setup my own dns server (BIND) on laptop with no problems so far. If you don't mind one additional process (25 MB) on your computer, this is a good solution.
You don't mention what operating systems you're using, but getting a caching name server running under most Linux distros and Windows versions is pretty easy.
I'd recommend running your own DNS server on your LAN, using "root hints" to provide lookup functionality for Internet names. That'll also let you create and use names for your various on-LAN resources, as an added feature.
If you can't solve the problem by running your own caching server in-house, then try some traceroutes out through your ISP to identify their upstream provider(s). Then look for VPS hosting companies that use those upstream providers, and rent a server there. Configure it also as a caching server, and also set up firewall rules so that only your company IP addresses can use the nameserver, port 43.
