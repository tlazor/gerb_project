I know there are a few config files that persist IIS settings - is it enough to archive them somewhere and load them if I need to restore my configuration?
The backups live in c:\inetpub\history by default, and the App Host Helper service (AppHostSvc) backs up a History copy every 2 minutes, if changes have been detected, to a max of 10 backups by default (configurable via Configuration Editor - open configHistory at the server level).
I need to know if there is a fairly painless way to save my entire IIS 7.5 configuration - including app pools and their settings, security params, etc. for backup/recovery etc.
If so, which files are needed for this? Where are they located? What else might need to be done so that I can always restore my production IIS settings when necessary?
Websites and apps also store settings in Web.config files within their directories, so you'll need to back these up with the website/content as well, but the sites, applications and other server-level settings are all stored in that applicationhost.config file.
I am not an trained sysAdmin or network engineer, just a programmer who has picked up some knowledge over the years, and at the moment I find myself managing an IIS 7.5 deployment on WinServer 2008 R2.
... which should do the job for you. It backs up your applicationhost.config file (and a couple of related configuration files), which is your central IIS configuration store.
