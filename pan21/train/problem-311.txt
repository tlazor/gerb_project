So I decided to open the asterisk-ridden file in another application to see what might happen. I tried Mac Pages first, and IT WORKED!!! All my data is there throughout my most recent save.  I'm going to work in Pages until my draft is done then either export it back out or cut and paste back into Word. Got to be careful to save often, though, as Pages doesn't have an autosave feature, last I heard.
There are two kinds of PC users: those who have learned the worth of backups and those who are going to.
I just had this happen on an appellate brief that's due in two days. There had been some other obnoxious glitch earlier (everything turned into symbols that time), so I had been emailing myself as I worked on the next section.  Well, I just finished a section and was in the middle of saving, and **************************. The immediate shut-down option was not going to work, because it just saved.
Microsoft Word tends to do automatic saves to a backup copy of your documents every 5 minutes or so while they are open. I don't know if this works for documents that--as of yet have no filename, though; nor do I know if it works for your version of MS Office; nor if it works on a Mac. 
To prevent a recurrence, as well as regularly saving ("File", "Save"), make sure your friend knows how to make a backup of all his documents to at least one separate location (a set of USB sticks, another PC or two, some cloud-storage, etc).
Our friend just had this happen to her, and we figured it out.  Just close out Word, open it again and under HELP, go to SEARCH FOR SOFTWARE UPDATES.  Let Word update itself to Version 4.1.2.  Now, reopen Word and your document will be recovered in the new version of Word.  A lot simpler than it seems.
This sounds like a bug in Microsoft Word. Programs, by and large, are notorious for having bugs, which is the reason that saving your work often is so often recommended.
Nevertheless, I shut down Word then re-opened the document. For a split second, the text was there before it turned back into asterisks. So I knew the data wasn't lost.
I would try "File", "Save As" and save as plain text. That way you you have a chance of saving a separate copy of the written material separate from the formatted material.
