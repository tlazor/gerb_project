I am creating a dashboard in Excel in which I want to restrict the input to a specific list. I used data validation to do so which works perfectly fine. However, normally the little drop-down button is visible when I select a cell (it is in any other workbook), but in my dashboard it keeps disappearing. Here is a small gif of the problem. 
BEST SOLUTION THAT REQUIRES NO MAJOR CHANGES: A strange solution that seems to work (for an unknown reason) is if you create a combo box (form control) and set the cell link and input range to =$1:$1048576 (this references all cells) on one of the sheets affected by the flashing arrows. This should stop the arrows from flashing/disappearing on the page with the combo box as well as all arrows in the whole workbook. You can put it in some obscure location on the sheet so it isn't visible to the user.
Deleting the camera image restored the normal drop-down button visibility. Creating a camera image anywhere in the workbook caused all drop-down buttons to act shy again.
Extra info: In the dashboard, I make use of VBA code and OpenSolver. Could they play a part in any of this?
If you used the camera tool, then if the input cells of the camera tool object (the linked cells) are on a different worksheet as the data validation dropdown enabled cells, the dropdown arrows go missing.
I've just had the same disappearing drop-down button behaviour shown in your gif. It might be there are other things that cause this behaviour as well but in my case it was caused by using the camera tool.
I really appreciate the tip. Note that my this fixed the issue with the Data Validation Dropdown but it also fixed an issue i had with my Cell Comments behaving the same way. Disappearing little bastards.
