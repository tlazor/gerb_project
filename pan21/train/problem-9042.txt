By and large, copper is preferred because the interfaces are less expensive and copper has the ability to deliver power concurrent with the transmission of data.  Always run copper to endpoints unless it is not possible.  As far as the links between networking devices it could be copper or fiber and like you said link distance is the primary determinant.
If speed and long distance coverage is essential in your network design and implementation  Optical Fiber cable is your best suite 
Combining this with the many available grades of multimode and you've got a recipe for confusion and investment one-way alleys. 
Singlemode, OTOH, is simpler, and the price delta down to multimode keeps getting smaller. I am not recommending anything except singlemode for new structural installs, limiting multimode new installs to backwards compatibility (ie. new computer room needs to interconnect with old FC infrastructure on 50Âµm or to closet switches on 1000BASE-SX). 
But beware of multimode fiber; it also has serious distance issues. You can only go 550 metres on GE (1000BASE-SX), and some of the 10GE modes manage 330 metres on really good multimode fiber (OM3 or OM4). In a larger colo or CO or in a campus setting, this is severely limiting. IMNSHO multimode is a "rack row" technique only for 10G. 
Lots of people have answered already; and I agree: Fiber beats copper as soon as distance becomes a factor.
