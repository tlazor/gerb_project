I also modified my code and added a queue for changing the vflip values, so that only the thread changes this setting which also created the PiCamera instance. But this doesn't seem to have any effect either.
According to http://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.10/api_camera.html#picamera.camera.PiCamera.hflip I should be able to call this method while the image capture is running. But I cannot disable it from True to False. This problem is on hflip and vflip property of the PiCamera object.
The code seems to work from the initial switch from False to True. I get the updated image stream with the flipped orientation. But when I try to update the settings more than once, if doesn't seem to work.
Is this option not working properly with multithreaded environments? Or what could possibly cause this behaviour? 
I'm trying to write a program which should control the PiCamera settings through a webpage with Flask. I'm trying to update the vflip and hflip settings (toggling from False to True and back again).
but running the same code inside a thread with some helper functions doesn't seem to have the same effect. I call set_vflip function from above first with True, and after some time with False, but it doesn't flip back.
