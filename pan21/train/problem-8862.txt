As stated above the partition is used as a "hidden" dynamic partition that can be used to restore your system to its factory defaults if you have a problem. If you already have backup and support media you should be able to remove this partition without worrying. To elaborate on the method above, I will provide a process that has been documented with varying success over the web.
If disk management is not your cup of tea, than I would suggest contacting the manufacturer regarding a possible approved method of removing the partition. If you want to roll up your sleeves then try the following.
Step 3) Try using a 3rd party partition tool like partition magic to extend your primary drive using the now unlocked partition. Want a free partition tool? try Gparted live cd or EASEUS Partition Master is also free, but I've never used it) 
That sounds like an OEM utility or recovery partition. You might be able to get rid of it using the disk tools in UBCD4WIN, Reatogo, BartPE, etc. You could then create a new, small partition out of it for your own use or you could image your machine, wipe out both partitions, create one partition from all the drive space, and retore your machine from the image.
step 1.) BACK UP. I recommend cloning your drive in the event you have a problem. If there is anything you can't afford to lose then by all means back it up! If worse comes to worse you will have to reformat.
