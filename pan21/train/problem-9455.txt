Besides, your are probably confusing NAS and SAN. Those are different technologies performance wise. If you are indeed using NAS, you should think twice, as this technology is not always suited for high I/O load.
I implemented this on my web server, removing images, scripts, and some misc handlers and noticed the log size was about 75% smaller than before.  Obviously when doing this you are unable to see entries in the log files for excluded items, but I was mainly concerned with page access.
You could consider limiting what is being logged in IIS.  For example, suppose you don't need to log the access to every image file, script file, or whatever.  There is an option in IIS 6 to limit what gets logged:
You should carefully examine your storage, probably its write performance is inadequate. You can also check what RAID level is being used. If it is RAID 5, you should consider going to a faster array like RAID 10, 01, 10E. You might also consider creating a separate RAID volume just for the logs, so that it does not interfere with IIS operation.
