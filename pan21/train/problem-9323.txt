Also, if you have I/O intensive applications running on the same disk that the pagefile is on, it will cause resource contention and reads/writes will be slow for both the pagefile and the other files that are being accessed.
Do a memory check, using a memtest86+ boot disk.  Verify the size detected is correct so you know that some of your RAM isn't dead.  This may take a few hours so you can run it overnight and check the results in the morning if you like.  If the memory is OK, then do a hard drive diagnostic with a MHDD boot disc.  Since the hard drive is 150GB I assume that it's EIDE/PATA.  If so you are looking for random read times under 150ms.  If you see any odd blocks with times higher than that, especially if you see any that show up in red, then you may want to invest in a new hard drive.  Bad memory can cause a false bad reading on MHDD so make sure you test the RAM first.
the pagefile is not SLOW, if the OS is reading the pagefile, its because the ram is not enough for the opened apps. 
Do you have your pagefile set to a specific size? You should leave it on "system managed" so that it can grow as needed.
what is slow is the disk. If you defragment the pagefile, the performance improvement will be minimum. you need more ram.
