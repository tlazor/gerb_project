The installation wizard failed to connect to the NETLOGON shared folder on domain controller SERVER.network.local. This is because another user or process is holding open a connection which is causing a credential conflict.
At first I though it was because everyone was logged on so I waited until everyone had gone home and tried again.  Same error.  I then tried closing down every other server and network device that we had accept the old domain controller and the new management server same thing again.
We are taking the route of joining EBS to the current domain and then decommisioning the old DC.  This seemed to be the simplest way to complete the migration.
Whilst running the Progress of Environment Check, one of the checks is SYSVOL and NETLOGON health check, which brings back the following error:-
Just in case anyone else has this issue, it was resolved by a simple restart of the Workstation service on the management server.
I have recently started a migration from Windows Small Business Server 2003 to Windows Essential Business Server 2008.
The strange thing is that I can see the old DC from the new server and I can navigate to the NETLOGON shared folder without issue.  I can ping each machine from the other.
I have run the preperation and planning wizards with no errors and everything seemed to be progressing smoothly.
To continue the installation, wait for all connections to close and then click check again. If the problem persists, contact Microsoft support for assistence.
