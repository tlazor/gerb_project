Power management in modern PCs is defined by ACPI specifications, "Advanced Configuration and Power Interface". The specification defines power and functional properties for "global states" (Gx), "system states" (Sx) and individual "device states" (Dx), and much more. Systems can have 6 power states, from S0 to S5.  Implementations of what a PC can do differ, so USB behavior can be different. See this article, ACPI Sleep States (S0 - S5) for ACPI states overview, or many other nice articles, this one shows an example of state diagram
Try to look at your BIOS. On many systems there is a option to keep the power connected on powering off. Set this to your wishes.
Shut down your laptop as follows:  Right click Start and select Shut down (not suspend). When OFF, unplug (as noted above) so that you do not keep the battery on AC power all the time. Everything will go OFF.
It is not so simple nowadays. This depends on particular design of "a computer" and what do you mean "turn it off".
If you have a really modern ACPI-compliant computer, you might have "allow hibernate" option, which might (I repeat, might) turn USB power OFF. This function is more likely on laptops. On simple desktops the USB power is derived from Power Supply +5VSB standby rail when PC is "soft-OFF". The +5VSB rail is "always ON", so USB power won't go away unless you disconnect you power cord from AC outlet.
