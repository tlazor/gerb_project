Verify, that all will be done as you want. If you're happy with the changes, just add -i to the end of previous command.
This line will replace all 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 which will allow all services be avaliable on all interfaces. You should replace 0.0.0.0 to the address of your choice.
I also tried to edit configuration IPs but there are in many places and seem to break OMP authorization. This solution was tested with latest Kali/OpenVAS (2016.09).
In /etc/default/greenbone-security-assistant I had to set the GSA_Address as the server address. This is what worked for me. I also had to access the server as myserver.mycompany.com:9392/omp, as just myserver.mycompany.com would not resolve. I understand my company's DNS needs a cleaning but I don;t have the time to fix that. Thank you both for your information, it saved me a lot of time and taught me quite a bit too.
You can append this option in the startup script located in /etc/init.d/openvas-scanner in the DAEMONOPTS constant.
There is much more simple solution. You can redirect external ip port to localhost using firewall. Assuming that Your's server external IP is 10.0.0.10:
Files are: greenbone-security-assistant.service, openvas-manager.service and openvas-scanner.service.
Oddly, I used both Firewallengineer and Tim Rain's answers and that solved my issue. I did notice that for whatever reason in /lib/systemd/system I had to put --allow-header-host myserver.mycompany.com athe the end of the ExactStart line.
