Right now i'm using Windows 10 under a VM with 2 cores and 4gb of RAM with 512mb of VRAM, and that's ok, but i'm wondering if i could allocate all 4 cores to that VM while using OSX at the same time. Are they going to scale proportionately or i'm going to experience some hickups on my machine? 3MB of L3 are not that much, but in theory, if i'm still able to do other stuff in some heavy load scenarios, i think this machine could handle that quite well.
4gb seems to be enough, even because my machine has 8, CPU in the other hand, it's quite good and shouldn't have any issue i think, even with all its resources shared. Thanks.
Using 2 cores only, leaves the other 2 dedicated to OSX only, but i was wondering if i could get better performance on the VM and OSX as well allocating all 4 cores to the VM. In that scenario, they will "self optimizing" themselves depending on the load?
In my case, i have a Macbook Pro with an Ivy Bridge i5, so 2 cores and 4 threads. Using Parallels, i can allocate up to 4 "cores" (presumably that sw calls cores even the logic one)to a VM.
i know the basic principles of VM, but i'm wondering if there is any issue allocating all cores to a VM.
