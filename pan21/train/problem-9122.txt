If you want to know which of many 3D objects the mouse is pointing at, you intersect the ray with each of the polygons in each of those objects. I recommend starting with brute force: intersect the ray with every polygon and see what hits. Do that first and make sure it gives you the results you want. In practice you'll want to intersect with just a few polygons instead of all of them, using a spatial hash or a gpu buffer with object ids.
Brief summary: A mouse location is (x,y) in screen coordinates. In your 3d world, the mouse location corresponds to a ray (or line) in world coordinates. You intersect that ray with everything in your world and see what it hits. The closest object that the ray hits is the one that the mouse is pointing at.
If you are representing your objects as 3D polygons in 3D space, the word to search for is “picking”.
If all you want to do is know where on the ground the mouse is pointing, it's fairly easy. You intersect the ray with the plane z = 0. Solve the equation and you get back (x, y, 0) in world coordinates. I recommend doing this even in the regular "2D" isometric world. Color keying tiles on the ground is a lot more complicated than solving this equation (color keying might make sense for more complex shapes though).
