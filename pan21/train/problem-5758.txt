Ideally, each user would be able to download a file up to 50/n mbps (where n is the number of users connected).
Also, I believe your notion of 50/n mbps per user as "fair" is misguided. For example, say you have only two users connected, one on fiber capable of 50 mbps download, and the other on dialup at 56 kbps. Do you really want to limit the fiber downloader to just 25 mbps, and basically waste the remaining 25 mbps on the dialup user?
Here's my problem : regarding bandwidth repartition, it's the jungle. I have users with standard ADSL connection, others with optic fiber connection, etc. Each user has a different download speed, and usually the largest download bandwidth wins.
I have a debian server at home using my personal internet connection (50 mbps up). I've set up a simple SFTP service with OpenSSH to share big files (10 Gb+) with multiple users.
What, exactly, is the problem you are having? Are the slower downloaders being starved out completely whenever someone with a fiber line is downloading? Unless that's the case, you should probably just let your server's TCP/IP stack deal with your clients' varying download speeds as best it can. Everyone should eventually get their chunk of your upload.
Since you're using Debian Linux, you can do it quite simple. You can use this script for "fair" repartition on the bandwidth:
If I were in your position, I wouldn't bother trying to impose this particular notion of "fairness". If you did, it wouldn't be long before users would figure out a way to grab a bigger chunk of your upload bandwidth anyway, by, for example, opening additional connections.
