Then it auto-selects F1 and either prints # about once a second forever, or it sits with a blinking cursor doing nothing.
One thing you may want to do is to disable the SATA and other disk related settings in the bios. From memory I recall the device not being recognised if disks were set to auto detect. Then disconnect any data connectors to other disks to make sure the O/S is only seeing the USB drive.
Forum posts and the wiki page linked above say to set the USB boot emulation mode to hard disk (as opposed to auto or CD/DVD/floppy), and older Dell PowerEdge models including the T310 have this option in the BIOS settings, but I cannot find it on the T320 with the latest BIOS 2.1.2.
I am trying to install FreeNAS on a Dell PowerEdge T320. I've followed the instructions here (http://doc.freenas.org/index.php/Burning_an_IMG_File) to write the .img file to four different USB sticks with dd if=FreeNAS-9.2.1.5-RELEASE-x64.img of=/dev/sde, but I can't boot off of any of them. When I try to boot, I get the following screen:
Has anyone been able to find this USB boot setting on a T320, or been able to boot FreeNAS/FreeBSD from USB in some other way on a T320?
I too have been trying to install free nas but on a Dell R720 server and have exactly the same problem with it not booting from the usb stick. I have managed to install it to a internal Hdd via a free nas live CD. Free nas doesn't recommend this as you lose storage hard drive space. 
I have used booting Linux from USB on the PowerEdge R320 (1RU rackmount, yours is a Tower) machines and it works fine. My machines were bought around March 2011. It sounds like it's still a BIOS issue.
