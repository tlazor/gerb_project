I'm aware that windows has a transfer utility wizard but I have never used that. What's the best way to Migrate or transfer data to a new laptop? Will that utility provide everything I need? Does the user need to reinstall programs on the new laptop first (e.g.Office)?
The migration tool included with Windows does not transfer all programs, it might get some, but it can't do everything. It's a good starting point for small migrations, then install programs as necessary.
My preferred method is to reinstall all the programs (we use images, so this sounds like much more work than it is, at least in my case); have the user login once then log back out; copy the user's profile from the old computer to the new; they're good to go. If I'm doing a bunch of PCs I'll pull out USMT to do the profiles automatically; usually rolled into an automated OS roll-out.
I would have the user install all of the necessary programs first, then use the built in Windows Easy Transfer tool. It makes it absolutely easy.
