This fills me with trepidation. I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a good way to manage a service. Mysql ships with startup scripts which will integrate with systemd and sysvinit which are the standard ways to start up a service in a Linux/Unix system. Systemd has built in capability to restart a failed service - but I have never seen a default config exercising this option for very obvious reasons, and if there were a good reason for doing so, it could be invoked with a respawn from the inittab on a sysV system. If this relates to running a per-user instance of the DBMS (in the way Kmail does) then the triggerring should be controlled by the user session, not by cron.
But leaving aside the legitimacy of the question, using mysql or mysqladmin to monitor the state of the service entails exposing the credentials to connect to the database - which is not a very good idea from a security viewpoint. It also creates complications around resource management (when you get to max connections, it may look like your service is down)
