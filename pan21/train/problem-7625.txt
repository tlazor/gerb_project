Log file shrinks usually happen quickly. However, you won't get an error if the file didn't shrink. SQL does not rearrange the log file to free up space at the end of the file, andd will only drop space from the end. Issue the command multiple times, if needed; this can generate enough activity to shift the current activity point in the log, and move it past the end. If all else fails, try again later.
The primary performance issue with shrinking the log is the fact that (outside of extraordinary situations, like yours) it will need to grow again. It can actually take longer to grow the log file than the data file (new space in the data file can basically be marked as "free", where new log file space has to actually be written over with zeros). Plus, if you shrink the log file down and then use that space for something else, then when the log file does need to grow, it may not be able to.
DBCC SHRINKFILE is what I would use. If in doubt, yuou can set up what you want via SSMS (right-click the DB; choose Tasks -> Shrink -> Shrink Files), and have it generate the script for you. Basically, you just need to specify the file to shrink and the target size.
You can limit the log file growth, but you do risk that chance that you'll need more space than you've allowed at some point, and operations will fail because the log is full. If you've got free space, I would probably just check on the log periodically, to make sure all looks good.
