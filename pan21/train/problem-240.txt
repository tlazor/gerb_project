I have a use-case of inserting about 1 million records every day, and would like the job to finish running in about 10-20 minutes. Will this count as 1 million IOP? Would that mean my IOPS should be 1000000/(10*60) = 1667 IOPS?
No. Assuming that Amazon accounts IOPs accurately (after all, they are virtual machines), there are some abstractions between SQL and disk IO operations:
I have not gone in detail about MySQL and OS internals, and even without doing that you can see that things are not obvious- in fact reducing IO and knowing why there is so much of it in some cases is one of the most important fields for database optimization.
For example, the other day I inserted dozens of millions of records at 200.000 rows/s with LOAD DATA (no SQL overhead) because I had enough memory to write almost exclusively to the InnoDB buffer pool. It took several minutes for the disk to synchronise with the memory contents, though.
An engine like InnoDB will require all of its pages to be written 3 or 4 times on insertion (one on the transaction log, one on the actual tablespace, one on the double write buffer and optionally, on the binary log)- and this is a simplification- it does not have into account index updates, metadata, statistics, etc. The best way to know how many IOPS you will need is to test on a particular setup. Even with some fake smaller tests it will be more reliable than tying to theorise. Caching both at OS and DB level will make the numbers dramatically different.
