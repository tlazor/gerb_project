You have to chose between singlemode and multimode. Singlemode fiber is cheaper than multimode but the transcievers are more expensive and the termination must be performed more carefully.
I have two Cisco Catalyst 2960-24TC-L switches and would like to connect them using fibre over a distance of 200Meters. According to cisco, the switches has two SFP ports, which I can clearly see on them but my issue is I do not know where or how to proceed knowing that I am not into networking at all. All I want to do is to make sure I am on the same page with the network engineer I will be contracting so they wont be here telling me what they want and not what we need.
I would suggest asking your installation contractor to price out both OM4 multimode and singlemode options and if the cost of the singlemode option is the same or only a little higher to go with the single mode option.
You can use short range SFP optics for this.  The Cisco part number is GLC-SX-MM, and the cost is about $75-$100 each (you'll need two).  The person installing your fiber should use 50uM multimode fiber (62.5uM is also useable, but you're getting close to the maximum range) with LC type connectors.
There you can see that 1000Base-SX SFP (part-number GLC-SX-MM) using 62.5 um MMF reaches 220 or 270 meters (depending on modal bandwidth of the fiber). However, if switches are 200 meters apart it could be easy that cable runs are actually longer than 220 meters. 
Singlemode fiber tends to be more future proof than multimode. Current high grade multimode fiber (OM4) will support 1G and 10G over the distance you are working at but is likey to have difficulty handling anything above that. 
Of course, you can make sure you won't exceed distance limit by using 50 um OM2 MMF , which covers up to 550 m with 1000Base-SX SFP.
