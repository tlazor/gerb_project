What speeds can I expect from the 300Mbps TP-Link TL-WR841N router if I do this? Will I be able to get 300Mbps or is the installation guy right and I'll be wasting my money?
The number is more of a theoretical maximum. My car has a speedometer that goes to 120MPH. I would not want to try driving my car that fast. WiFi speeds are like that. 300Mbps is using two channels (what used to be called Multiple In, Multiple Out, or MIMO), It's using two distinct signals (you might have two external antennas) with a maximum of 150Mbps per channel.
Now, the problem is that I couldn't find anywhere in this thing's specs how many Mbps it has. I couldn't get more than 50Mbps on any device (phone, laptop, tablet).
Seems I can use this device as a "bridge" (for doing just the medium conversion) and stick my own router into it. I was thinking of a 300Mbps TP-Link TL-WR841N router but the installation team said I'm going to waste my money because it will work just as worse as the gpon onu, which I don't get.
Some context for my question. I have a fiber optic connection to my home on a 300Mbps data contract. The contract includes a device that converts from optical to Ethernet. It's a gpon onu an5506-02-FG which also acts like a Wi-Fi router.
Even in ideal conditions (close range, no interference) the 300Mbps flavor of 802.11n only delivers a little over 200Mbps of TCP/IPv4 throughput.
If you want a good chance that your clients can get at least 300Mbps of throughput over Wi-Fi even when they're in the next room, you want to use 2- or 3-stream 802.11ac with 80MHz-wide channels (867Mbps or 1300Mbps AC). Note that your client devices (the ones that you want to get 300Mbps+ throughput) will need 2- or 3-stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards as well.
