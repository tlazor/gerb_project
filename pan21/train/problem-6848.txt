Google has the ability to check any pop3 account and download the emails.  The only question which you need to answer yourself is what you need to do to allow your Google account to access your Yahoo account.
This would take a lot of time, but I have no doubts about its effectiveness in providing me peace of mind, that yes, I am using my new Gmail account, and doing so directly.
I am concerned that forwarding emails is going to create a "weakest link in the chain" effect. I know it's highly unlikely anyone would gain access to my Gmail, but if they did manage to guess my password on Yahoo, they could essentially see some of my most important emails as they are being forwarded, thus nullifying the benefit of two-step verification. Is this assumption correct?
Also, if you know a better way to do this, and I didn't list it, please feel free to consider that too as an answer. Any tips or advice would be helpful as well. Thanks!
I have decided to ditch my Yahoo email addresses, and add a second Gmail address for my "professional" stuff (bills, college, work, etc). I am doing this because of the 2-step verification feature Gmail offers.
You could set the Yahoo account to forward, and set up filters in your gmail for them as they arrive and you decide they're not important and will never be. That way specific senders can skip the inbox while any emails from an address you've not dealt with yet in the gmail yet will still hit the inbox.
If you follow the directions listed Here you can then setup your google account as imap and simply upload the emails to your Google acccount.  This is only required if Yahoo blocks Google from downloading emails through pop3.
