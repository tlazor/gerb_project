Is there a simple environment I can install (or run from USB/CD, don't care much) which doesn't use so much power, and allows me to simply read an e-book and (optionally) watch a movie? I don't need any fancy effects and features or anything, I just want a long battery life.
The minimum a laptop needs is an OS. The best you can do is find every setting in that OS that has to do with power management, and set it to the most economic option. Modern BIOSes have options for power management too. CPU's often have a setting that lowers the clock speed when it is under no or low load. If you'd like to turn your old laptop in a dedicated long-lasting movie and reading machine, you can downclock everything.
I know a tablet or an e-book reader would be probably the perfect solution for this, but they usually cost (rather a lot) of money.
E-book readers are relatively inexpensive. Check prices for basic Kobo ($67?), basic Kindle and similar devices. As you know, the battery on these can last weeks or even months of typical usage.
If you don't need wifi, turn it off. Lastly, not only good for your eyes when reading or watching movies is to lower the screen backlighting. Nearly every laptop, if not every, has a button or function key to do this easily.
Basically those are all the steps you can take to reduce power consumption, but I'm afraid that on most laptops you can't get more than two and a half hours at best.
On my laptop, I'm currently running Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 2, which works great. But sometimes I just want to lie in the couch watching a movie or reading an e-book. At times like that, the power consumption of a modern desktop is a bit of a pain in the bum (about one and a half hour on a full battery).
