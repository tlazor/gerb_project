As found on the elinux site. I only selected what applies to your situation but please visit them for more information...
Make sure you have a good power supply. Try and unplug everything and see how long it lasts. Plug items back in one by one testing the stability.
I plan to use it to boot my RPi. If I need data to be writen, I will use an USB drive that I'll mount readonly (I prefer my SD to be safe and corrupt an USB drive than having to repair my SD)
Just to cover all ground, also check if your power supply is good enough. try other charger or plug the RPI to a PC USB port to test it. Remember that the recommended RPI supply is about 700mA, but some weak chargers might not sustain this at stable levels.
If you have followed all those steps then the only possible thing to try is use another SD Card carefully selected from the compatible list. Also make sure to buy original card from a trusted place. Not like ebay china or something.
As indicated there, "Also, use “ipe-rw” and “ipe-ro” to switch the root file system to writeable or read-only mode."
Depending of what you use your RPi for, you may be insterested in IPE, which is a "blackout-proof flavour of Raspbian".
I had a router that start to act crazy for some days, then went ok, then again went crazy and later fine again ... i found that the power supply was outputting changing voltage (3V to 5.5V) on the time the router was crazy. Replaced that supply with a new one all is fine. So try replace the power supply and measure the output voltage.
Finally, turn off the RPI by shutting down the OS and only unplug the RPI when you got only one red led. the RPI is not really shutdown if you have other than one red led. Also, try to avoid disconnect the rpi by removing the power supply from the plug, it's better to remove the power from the RPI and only after remote the power supply from the plug.
