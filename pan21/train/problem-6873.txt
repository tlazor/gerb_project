I don't know the capabilities of CPANEL but either option should work.  Comments by others indicate you may have to manually edit the Apache configuration for the first option.
You require 1 ip address per SSL certificate/domain. Afraid that's the way it works. You can have as many non ssl domains as you want per ip.
You would need multiple IP addresses for multiple SSL certificates. But one SSL certificate can have more domains in it. Either by including multiple domains (example.org, serverfault.com, shop.example.org) or using a wildcard certificate (*.example.org).
If you configure all the domains on both HTTP and HTTPS, you may want to redirect HTTPS connection on the non SSL domains to redirect to HTTP.  The Apache rewrite documentation should cover the rewrite rules required.
If you are running SSL for only one domain this should be no problem.  Configure a virtual server on port 443 with the SSL certificate.  Configure virtual servers on port 80 for all the domains.  You may want the HTTP service for the SSL domain to automatically forward to HTTPS.
Your shared hoster had probably put multiple domains into a single SSL certificate, hence you would be fine with 1 dedicated IP. Your dedicated provider possibly want to push you to use a dedicated SSL certificate for each domain, each requiring a dedicated IP address.
There is a way to do that, but it requires you not to use Cpanel and edit Apaches config directly, most providers only charge $1 for an extra IP. I suggest you just get another IP if you don't want to start editing configs manually.
