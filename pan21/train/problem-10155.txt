So, I had a day off in the meantime as well as was working on several different tests regarding this idea, and thus had not responded in a bit.
Unfortunately free meant using SQL Express and one of the three instances breached the 10GB database cap nullifying the project test.
Their options now are to purchase SQL server, utilize a MySQL server data migration, or simply query the live databases (not my first choice, that is for sure.)
To recap.  The goal is to synchronize select tables, including data, key, indexes, etc... from one remote database server to another to form a sort of DIY data warehouse for reporting purposes.  Finally, this is to be done basically for free minus my time involved.
I settled on an initial Export of the database using SSMS for the tables required, then followed up with a script generation of the database to capture table keys, indexes, and constraints, as well as other database information not captured with the simple database data export.
This allowed a stripped-down dataset that still had keys, indexes, and constraints for the required tables while saving space on the destination server.
Thank you all for the assistance folks.  If nothing else, it was very good taste of SQL work that I had not previously had, as well as investigating each and everyone's solution suggestions.  Thank you, all.
