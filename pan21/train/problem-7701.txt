The following config is safe for the version I've tested - 2.6.6 on ubuntu 12.04 - the previous examples crashed the server. Put this into /etc/logrotate.d/mongod:
See: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-11087 for more details and a suggestion from Akshay Kumar which I used in the above (use create instead of nocreate and cp /dev/null to the logfile).
And now get well-named logfiles from logrotate and empty logfiles like mongodb.log.2013-09-18T23-49-44 as traces of SIGUSR1 switching. How to get rid of the latter?
Note that in version 3.0 and higher it is not required to kill your database daemon simply to rotate a log. Refer to documentation here:
Since mongodb 3.0 you can change the behavior of mongodb with the logRotate parameter, change in /etc/mongod.conf
In later releases there is supposed to be a logRotate option you can use to reopen the file - not rename it - which will work around the rename problem -  but it didn't work in my version (it was unsupported).
The server crashed for me if you send SIGUSR1 to mongod after you have moved the logfile out of the way with logrotate.
I want the OS's logrotate ability to zip old files and remove oldest, but see no way to tell mongod process to switch current log other than sending SIGUSR1.
