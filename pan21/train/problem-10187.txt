Since you do know programming and databases, you already have most of the necessary tech knowledge to make a game.
As Almo said, 3D game development requires some basic algebra, and so does 2D, but most of the actual development is just writing algoritms and loops. If you use an engine, depending on the engine, usually most of the physics will be taken care of, especially if you use a physics-based engine like Box2D.
To answer your main question: most game developers are slightly better than most at math, since they use it more than in some careers, but it should not be a problem for you if you manage to pass all of your high school and college math courses. Especially if you use an engine, you will not have to deal with most of the math. Also, there may be some modules (like the math module in Python) that will take care of things like rounding algorithms for you.
Your school experience doesn't tell much about how good you are at math. I sucked at math back in school. Learning it when you have the code to mess with and test different values is a lot easier than learning some abstract equation in a classroom.
AI in game development is often made of behavior trees, or logical paths that are chosen between based on previous choices, with some slight randomness.
When you face a problem that needs math to solve, stop for a while, look for the already known solutions, test them and start learning from the basics so you can get there. I only actually learned geometry, radians, sin and cos when I had to make characters move in an angle. Before that, I had little idea what these things were.
