This is not a windows problem but a networking problem.  if you are on the 192.168.1.x network, you would need a router to get traffic over to the 10.0.0.x network.  If there is no router then you will be unable to connect to any other networks.
If the server is acting as a gateway, has both the 192.168.1.1 and the 10.0.0.1 addresses, and the client is using it as its gateway, then the client you should be able to reach both its "internal" interface (the one the server directly shows to the client) and its "external" one (the one the server has on the other side). No special confgiuration should be required for this.
Just make sure that either the clients have an appropriate route (10.0.0.1 reachable through 192.168.1.1) or whatever device is their gateway has an appropriate route. There should be nothing special you should have to do -- so long as your routing is sensible, this should "just work".
The client will simply send to the server packets addressed to 10.0.0.1 (because it's its default gateway), and the server will handle them itself because it knows that it owns that address.
You should have routing enabled between the two interfaces, though (just add the RRAS role and configure it as a simple router with no NAT).
