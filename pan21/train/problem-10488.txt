There is a disadvantage to making everything smaller and more energy efficient - it is very delicate!!!!
If a media blackout was ever desired by anyone with the power (good guys or bad guys)  it could easly be done by any weapon that causes an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP).    
SSD or flash drives store information as electrical charges on a silicon chip.  The charges are stored as a positive or negative charge similar to a capacitor. They are more reliable because they do not suffer from mechanical failure like regular magnetic disk hard drives.  Solid state devices are a major improvement over magnetic storage but they are not invincible.  The EMP from a nuclear detonation could wipe/alter/damage the charges on the chip thus destroying data.  
I have personally lost 3 magnetic disk hard drives because of mechanical failure.  By the way 2 of the drives where made by Toshiba.  I now use a SSD (solid state drive) hard drive for my laptop and have not had any problems yet but I dont trust anything manmade.  A good practice is to back up all files often.
