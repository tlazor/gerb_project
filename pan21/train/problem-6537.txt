With the Creators Update yet another way to reset the system has been introduced to Windows 10 called "Fresh Start" which can be found in the Windows Defender actions. The more I read about the more I get confused whether I want to use the old "Reset this PC" method (described here) or the new "Fresh Start" method.
I have done a backup of all necessary personal files, games and such onto my D:\ hard drive which is different from the system drive. I am looking for the right method to wipe the C:\ drive and reinstall Windows fresh onto it to start anew. So which method is suitable in my case?
You have two options if you don't want to use the commercial vacuum cleaner method to install Windows.  
Basically I haven't reinstalled the computer in ages and just updated through all versions of Windows 8, the upgrade to Windows 10 and the Windows 10 updates themselves. Now I want to completely wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows 10 from scratch and it seems as if I can reduce the hassle of creating a boot medium and going through the installer itself with the new options.
Of course that is like using a commercial vacuum cleaner to pick up a single Cheerio that your kid dropped on the floor.
If you want to completely wipe the HDD then the only way to do that is to use WinRE, by booting to a Windows installation disk, and using diskpart to delete your existing partitions.
