According to the man page for zip (online version for easy reference: http://linux.die.net/man/1/zip), the zip command has a -u flag which it describes as:
If you're being less theoretical, more practical, more "I don't want to have to manually unzip/zip" there are tools that you can use. ark on Linux is one I've used. You could also mount the archive with fuse-zip, though that's probably more work than a temp file.
I sometimes need to make changes to a .zip or .jar file, so I usually move the file to /tmp, extract all the files with unzip, edit a few files, and then re-zip up the files.  This works, but it can be tedious.  Is there a utility or shell script that I can use to edit a file inside of a zip file without explicitly calling unzip and zip (even if it's just a wrapper around these commands)?
Short pedantic answer; no. If you think about compression, you're using redundancy to shorten the files inside, so any edit changes the whole file within the archive, possibly the archive.
