On a lighter note, I like the neologism dedomenology (in French, dédoménologie), and I tend to consider that Hugo Steinhaus (the inventor of $k$-means) was, due  to his interest in many applied fields, one of the first to spark the fire of data science.
In several subfields, some were simply called analysts. If you go back earlier in time, in a pre-science era, I tend to believe that people involved in divination or astrology (several of them because they were paid for that, much more than for serious science) were precursors.
An ideal data scientist is 60-70% Statistician and 30-40% a computer scientist and so the old name of "Data scientist' was somebody who was part statistician and part computer science guy.
Of course, this has been done before, in some combination of statistics, mathematics and programming, but it was not wide spread to give rise to the new term. The real rise of data science is from the ability to gather large amounts of data, thus need to need to process it. 
I do think it is new job, basically data scientist has to apply mathematical algorithms on data with considerable constraint in terms 1) Run time of the application 2) Resource use of the application. If these constraints are not present, I would not call the job data science. Moreover, these algorithms are often need to be ran on distributed systems, which is another dimension of the problem.
Some really nice answers already. However, I would break the entire process of breaking the work of a data scientist into who actually did those:
