We are running Access through VMWare hosted Citrix XenApp servers. I have been able to reproduce this behavior with my own login through XenApp, through Remote Desktop, and through vSphere console, on both XenApp servers where this app resides. 
I'm not at the point, yet, where I want to reinstall Office on both servers. This problem does not appear to exhibit in other Office applications. When I run Office applications through RD or vSphere, they display the OneNote icon in the taskbar, although the correct icon is displayed in every other place the icon should show - and this does exhibit with other Office apps.
We have some users running MS Access 2010 (don't ask me why, we have MSSQL licenses they could use) and have recently run into a problem.
I'd blame it on a corrupt office/Access install, but it happens on both XenApp servers. I'd blame it on a bad database, but it happens when creating a new database. I'd blame it on XenApp, but it happens when I login via the console.
It looks like, after I ran Excel to test if this problem also occurred with other Office apps, that Access is using the Excel icon in the taskbar.
