I have spent the last hour Googling for an answer to my question and although some questions are close, I of course want to verify my particular need to ensure I do not introduce any unneeded downtime at my facility. In short, I need to reinstall Windows on both my DC1 (primary) and DC2 for conformity reasons and would like to verify the process.
Once the PDCe role (and any other roles) is moved, you can demote the DC. Once you have reinstalled Windows and promoted DC1 again, you would follow the same steps for DC2.
Please let me know if I am completely off base and, ideally, documentation/best practices documentation from Microsoft that will cover this procedure.
However, purposely running with only one domain controller makes me nervous. I highly recommend that you run a third domain controller at least temporarily, if not permanently. If you decide to run one temporarily, possible options include a VM (on an existing virtualization host or a Windows 8 machine or even if its something like VirtualBox) or just using a desktop computer temporarily.
Since PDCs no longer exist, every DC you have is a "primary" for all intents and purposes. That is, if you take one offline all you have to do is demote it and remove it properly from AD (metadata, etc). You'd want to follow these steps to avoid headaches down the road.
