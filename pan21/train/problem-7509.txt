This is a very simple trick that can hide the folder. But not password protecting it. Anyone who has basic knowledge in batch programming can write batch file to unhide it. But you can make it into exe file and then nobody can change the password as in batch file. But they can write another batch file to do it. This kind of folder is not visible even when chosen the show hidden file option. Compile it into exe file.
The normal way on windows to protect files (in a folder) would be EFS. However it is tied to the login password, so you don't really see its effect (and it does not help if you share the password or the account).
Real password protection for a selected directory tree can be achieved with disk encryption tools (like truecrypt). When you want to unlock the directory, you need to mount the truecrypt file, and for this you need the password. BitLocker is the build in option from Windows, but I think you need the Ultimate edition to use it as flexible as TrueCrypt in this scenario.
The best you can do is encrypt it using windows default features. But technically it wont be password protected...
