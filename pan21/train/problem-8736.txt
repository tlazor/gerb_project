The reason for the problem is the image is inline (it is treated as one giant character in the paragraph between other characters). The paragraph that the image belongs has Line Spacing: Exactly set (under Paragraph -> Indents and spacing -> Line Spacing). You can fix this problem by changing the Line Spacing value to anything else (such as At Least or Single).
Since the paragraph has exact spacing any glyph which is larger than the line is cut off which is what you see. You may need to fiddle with the image options to position it in the way you want.
Had the same problem. I used Google docs instead of Word and it printed fine. It is certainly a problem with Word 2010. Change your version or use another word editor
Looks to me that the image is set to appear behind text and also the paragraphs have a background shading of white which causes the image to be cut off behind the shading.
I had the same problem today. I tried everything (including things suggested here) and nothing worked. I finally noticed that the paragraph marks on that page (which was a new Section) were in the middle rather than at the right margin (when right-aligned). I went to Columns and selected "One"...in effect, none...voila, fixed! 
I encountered the same problem and found a solution. My image in a Word 2010 doc was set to In Front of Text and was truncated in the print out. When I do a Format in Picture Tools to change it to In Line with Text, the image came out properly in the print out. I tried some of the suggestions above but they didn't work.
