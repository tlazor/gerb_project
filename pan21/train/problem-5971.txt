Another product is from Adafruit and is a small Arduino compatible that can be programmed to act as a keyboard. And yes, you can have a keyboard with only two keys if you want. Adafruit almost certainly has sample code for this purpose. Adafruit also has a variety of switches that can be used if you don't already have any.
These drivers allow you to hook up buttons to arbitrary GPIO lines (the simpler GPIO keys driver need them to be able to fire an interrupt, but there's also a polled variant) and assign a keycode to them. You can either choose the keycode of a known key or use your own keycodes, then map them to the required keysym, e.g. with Xmodmap. The latter makes it possible to assign different functions to your new key when shift/control/alt are pressed.
They are called "fightsticks" and this is a sample available from Amazon. I'm not suggesting that you get one, merely using them as a proof of concept.
All you need to do is to emulate a USB HID device with a couple push buttons. There are many examples of these, mainly in the arcade emulation field.
