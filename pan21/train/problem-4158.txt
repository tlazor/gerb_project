Essentially, somewhere in there, there should be a section of Binds which shows which values were bound to that :1 variable.  The article doesn't do a good job of explaining how to tell which binds went to which queries since the example had only one query (and I can't figure it out from looking at it).  Ignore the sort|uniq bit they used at the end to show that it was always the same query over and over, and you should get results like
Here is the complete list of available commands to start the trace with bind variables recording (source: SQL trace, 10046, trcsess and tkprof in Oracle 10g):
To record bind variable values there are other, alternative ways, to start the trace depending on your Database version and loaded packages.
I think it would help to isolate the problem if I could determine the specific value of :1, however the 4.7M file doesn't seem to offer that information.
If the trace (.trc) file is missing Bind Variable values (or Parameter values in a OracleCommand in ODP.NET for example) this is due to the way the trace has been started.
