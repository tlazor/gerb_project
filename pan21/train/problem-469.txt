It might have to do with your router and its cpu, if the router acts as the OpenVPN client. If that's the case (router capped at 10 Mbps) the you will need a stronger device like the following D-Link Wireless Gigabit router http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Wireless-N600-Dual-Band-Gigabit-DIR-826L/dp/B0081TXJ28 
I have bought a tunnel service by using OpenVPN. For a year I've had 10 Mbps max upload/download speed but now I've bought an additional 20 Mbps making the available total bandwidth 30 Mbps for me.
On their homepage there are some controls available for me, for example to restart the tunnel. I've done that. It also says that the speed has indeed been upgraded to 30 Mbps on their page. I also got an email that said they have upgraded the speed.
However after I reboot my machine, and OpenVPN has started up and is running as usual, when I look at the Windows Task Manager (opens when pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) in the "Networking" tab I still have a link speed of only 10 Mbps.
Two adapters are listed: Local Area Connection 4 (10 Mbps) and Local Area Connection 5 (100 Mbps). LAC5 is my "real" adapter, I have a 100 Mbps Internet connection if I don't use a tunnel. LAC3 is the virtual adapter used by OpenVPN. The problem is that it is still showing 10 Mbps even though I have upgraded to 30 Mbps.
