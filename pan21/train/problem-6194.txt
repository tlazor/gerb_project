If you were to use apache for this, create a name based virtual host for each domain you want apache to answer for and use mod_proxy to forward requests on to the correct machine.
Some residential hosting companies in the states (suddenlink and time warner) block inbound traffic on port 80, so if you can't get it working on 80, try another port.
I have an ip like username.dyndns.org, this is the external IP of my router. On my lan, I have several machine (m1, m2, ...) , each running a dedicated web server. Is it possible to reach each machine from the outside with something like: http://m1.username.dyndns.org http://m2.username.dyndns.org ? Do you know what needs to be configured in my router for NAT ? Also, is there a special directive in Apache to do so ? Thanks a lot, Regards, Luc
Yes, it's possible.  Just add a ruleset to the NAT table on your router that points to the IP of webserver using port 80.  There is also a section on the router which you can define your dyndns redirection to refresh your IP every 30 mins.
