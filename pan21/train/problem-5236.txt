I have tried disabling IPv6. I have tried disabling/enabling the network connection. I have restarted Windows multiple times. I have tried disabling Windows Firewall.
I've run into this many, many times on Windows XP (not, so far, on 7 or 8, and let's just pretend Vista never happened, mmkay?)  In almost all cases, it was a problem with the WinSock  (Windows Sockets) stack.
If you can communicate with LAN devices (default gateway) with no issues then itâ€™s WAN related, simply try pinging external targets or running tracerts on them. Sometimes my Windows notification is a little behind my ipconfiguration and I have to renew it again for it to go away.
I still carry around a utility called "WinsockXPFix.exe", which has managed to fix the problem nine times out of ten.  I'm afraid I really don't know how much has changed under the hood between XP and 8, so the same utility might very well not work on 8 - but netsh winsock reset ought to do the same; here's a Microsoft article on the subject.
I can access the network fine, browse shares, see the other machines etc. but the network icon in system tray says "No Internet access.". 
I never figured it out - but it's working again. I'd given up on restarting the router/gateway machine because it wasn't helping after the first two tries. Then I tried it one more time, and the ADSL connection didn't come back up, leaving the whole network without internet access. Panicked, restarted the router and the gateway machine again, and suddenly my PC has Internet access again.
