That said, I'm one of those guys who likes a clean and tidy system. I defragment my drives because I enjoy it and I run a registry cleaner because junk offends me on a personal level.
If you experience Registry Corruption or Registry Damage you could use an especific tool to recover your lost registry keys from a previous backup.
Only using Registry Cleaner to remove unused keys or orphan registry keys maybe will Boost the Start-up cause registry will be smaller and will take less time to be loaded.
A registry cleaner will not fix crashes or problems of any kind because it only removes entries that it knows have no effect.
Im personally against that Registry Cleanup Software which made a one touch registry clean task, without any noticeable warning, you always should keep in mind the scenario  where it is mandatory to touch the registry.
Some viruses and malware, stores registry keys to reinforce the infection. you should use some anti malware software feature to remove that malicious keys from you registry and in that scenario the Registry modifications are justified.
Would I be better off with not cleaning registry at all? Because benefits are dubious and the risk of messing it up is higher
Most so called experts would say online that registry cleaning speeds up your computer. I just found a handful opinions that say otherwise i.e. Howtogeek article
And be carefull using Registry Tweakers only because you was warned by an ad or by a mail or for amateur forum, it could be only a trick to infect your system, there are some Scareware just to made some scamm to good people.
While a registry cleaner will have a very slight effect on performance, it's generally too small to measure. The registry is a fairly efficient structure, so reducing its size slightly won't make accesses measurably faster. And the time to detect that a file does not exist is pretty small too, so removing entries that lead to non-existent files won't save much time either.
