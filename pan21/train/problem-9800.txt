If you want the NOC to be able to ack everything then add them to the authorised_for_all_service_commands and possibly the host equivalent. This means they'll also be able to disable active checks etc.
All of this depends on your users logging into the web interface with their own usernames, which must match the contact names. This works well with LDAP authentication, for example.
I've went through the cgi.cfg file which controls user permissions in Nagios but I couldn't find the directive which talks about alert ack's even though I read the whole file.
During these times, the NOC team keeps getting alerts regarding the problematic issues but have no access to acknowledge them.
Users also get alerts for hosts/services for which they are contacts. So, if a user gets an alert, that user can also acknowledge the alert.
Sometimes there are alerts which are not so urgent and can wait for the next morning until they are taken cared of.
Unless you override the behavior by adding them to authorized_for_<whatever> options in cgi.cfg, users can only see or interact with hosts/services for which they are contacts.
