You can probably also add this somewhere to some automount scripts, but this would be another question.
I'm using XAMPP on windows for apache/mysql servers. It's on my portable hard drive. So, if i'm at home i just open XAMPP control panel and click Start Apache, Start Mysql. It works "drive-letter free". So if my portable hard disk is on D drive on my laptop, my document-root is "/www" regardless of drive letter. XAMPP thinks "well, /www is on the root of the drive which i'm running". And after that, if i go to work and plug-in my hard drive (say, it's G) XAMPP can still work because it search for folder relative to drive root.
I'm using Windows for my development operations but i'm deploying to Debian/Ubuntu based distros. So i thought if i move my development to a linux distro it will be more comfortable.
I suggest to configure your linux-apache to have an empty folder as document root. Then you plug in your usb stick as usual, and it gets automounted. With mount you can now override the empty folder with the subfolder of your mounted usbstick:
