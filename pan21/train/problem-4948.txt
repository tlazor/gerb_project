The only way is to use an external "observer" such as whatismyip.org to help. If you don't like having to access it through a full web browser curl is an alterantive as pointed out by Samuel K
If your computer is on e.g. a corporate LAN with an address-translating firewall there is unfortunately no information on your computer about the externally visible address. For all your computer knows it has a local IP (e.g. 192.168.0.103) that can be used to connect to any host on the Internet. The address-translating firewall is completely transparent from your computer's point of view.
If your machine is assigned a local IP address, it may not know your public-facing address.  You can query a server not on your local network to discover your public-facing address.
I'm looking for a way to get my IP address using the command prompt in Linux. I know when you type "ifconfig" you can get your local IP address (i.e. 192.168.0.103), but I'm looking for my IP address that I get from my ISP. How can I get this from Linux without having to visit some website?
