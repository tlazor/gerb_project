Since you already have a fast processor and video card, the best way to improve the system performance is to max the storage I/O throughput. The biggest bottleneck is your hard drive. So you'd want a motherboard with an extra PCIe slot for your hard drive controller add-in card.
In most cases, a motherboard with integrated graphics is a warning sign... it typically caters for the 'budget' market and will compromise system components.
The primary bottleneck has traditionally been front-side bus speed. Several years ago AMD moved the memory controller onto the CPU, so the front-side bus was running at clock speed. Intel finally followed suit with Nehalem (Core i7). The next point of contention is the speed to the RAM itself, where higher is better.
Most people don't think about this, either because they don't know or don't care, but the slots closer to the CPU are slightly faster. The difference is very small. If you want your sound card close to the CPU, you'll want a board that has a PCI-X1 slot at the top of the stack.
Currently, Intel chipsets are G41/31 43, 45 and X58. Shopping for features is secondary for searching for the right chipset. After you decide which chipset you want, you're selection will be between very similar models, varying mainly by manufacturer (avoid something other than the big 3 - Asus, Gigabyte and MSI), form factor (ATX/mATX, etc.) and minor features (dual HDMI/3 eSata)
In a nutshell, motherboards, or specifically chipsets have "tiers" - just like CPUs (Celeron, Pentium, Core 2, Core i7 etc.). 
Now we get to the expansion slots. What is best for you depends on what you want to build. Are you planning to run a single graphics card, or two? The number of PCI-Express slots varies between motherboard models, and the capabilities vary too. Some motherboards have a single PCI-X16 slot, others have two. How many PCI-X4 slots do you need? PCI-X1?
