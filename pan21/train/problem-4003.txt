As has already been said - you need to check the MySQL log files. Clearly MySQL is failing to start. Hopefully there is some sort of useful error in those log files to point you in the right direction. The vast majority of times I've seen this is has been because the partition on which MySQL stores it's raw data is full. By default this would the /var partition.
Chance are /var/run/mysqld/ doesn't exist. Create it and own it to mysql:mysql and your server should start. 
Also note that InnoDB is a journaling storage engine. This means that you do not recover disk space by deleting records (you actually loose more disk space). So using InnoDB for things that don't need InnoDB (or need not be InnoDB, like a sessions table) will cause you storage (and backup) problems. You can check to see your InnoDB usage with:
If it's a disk space issue, it may be worth clearing some log files from /var/log to get the server up and running; Longer term, you might want to consider moving the mysql folder to a different drive, or finding some way of shrinking the data bases (maybe by archiving old data). If at all possible, it may be time to look into getting a larger disk for the server.
