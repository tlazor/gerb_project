I will soon be setting up a home server running both Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu Linux. This server will host some webservices, and as a home user, sometimes unexpected maintenance is required (this machine is multipurposed). My idea was to run these webservices in a virtual machine so that I could migrate them to another machine for a few hours, and then move them back when they're done.
EDIT: Okay, no "live" migration. What about cross-platform virtualization which can be painlessly moved between servers and operating systems while the VM is shut down?
As for moving from one platform to another - I highly encourage you to use a bare-metal hypervisor unless this is a workstation. If it's a workstation then stick with Virtual PC or KVM (Win and Linux respectively). If you insist on trying to get cross-platform working, Virtual Box or QEmu may be your best bet, but both have slightly different hardware available to the VM based on the host OS. It'll turn into a tricky situation quickly.
Virtualization is not some simple layer you can add to any OS, it's extremely complicated. While it provides certain benefits, many of which are of great benefit and importance, those come with many drawbacks, limitations, and penalties (performance not being the least of them).
Hyper-V Server R2 supports clustering and live migration; but requires a SAN to do so. I think most solutions will require infrastructure that will be well out of your price range.
