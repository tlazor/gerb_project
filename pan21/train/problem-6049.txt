There may be settings in the BIOS that will allow you to control the processor speed.  In a previous Dell laptop I had, you could either allow it full control or force it to a minimum, so that may not be what you're looking for.  
82 degrees is really hot.  I would suggest getting an external cooler, such as this or this.  I have both of these.  The latter is larger, lighter and quieter, but it's not as forgiving of rough handling or balancing the laptop on one knee (causes the fan to scrape).  Both of these work very well for keeping my laptop running cool under almost any circumstance.
Another option is to install a fan control program and force your fans to spin fast earlier than the motherboard does on it's own.  My preferred program is SpeedFan, but it has a tendency to not work on Inspirons.  If you're not running 64 bit windows, then there is an Inspiron-specific alternative here.  Both of these can be set to turn on fans at specific temperatures, or you use them to just force the fans to high all the time.
