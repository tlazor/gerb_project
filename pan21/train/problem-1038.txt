When I run the backup statement from the MGMT Studio console the backup is saved to the disk of the other host, instead of transferring the backup to the client machine. Any ideas how I will be able to backup an MSSQL database from another host different than the mssql engine itself?
We want to do the same from another host but when we add the -H for host option on the command we get "The login failed".  With MS SQL Server Management Studio, we are able to login to the other server fine with Windows Authentication since my machine and the other host are using the same usernames with same password.  
You should be specifying the server name in the -s parameter, not -H, though this will still backup to the server the SQL service is running on.
In my experience SQL Server is fussy about operating on network drives, but you could try specifying a UNC path (\\<server>\<share>\<backup_file>) to the place you want the backup to go to on the network. I believe that the user the SQL Server instance is running as will need write access to the destination machine, I don't think it will use your account despite logging in via Windows integrated security, so you will need to arrange that first.
