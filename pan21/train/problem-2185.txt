an inexactly phrased but reasonable general question that can be studied in several particular technical ways. there are many "small" machines measured by states/symbols where halting is unknown but no "smallest" machine is possible unless one comes up with some justifiable/quantifiable metric of the complexity of a TM that takes into account both states and symbols (apparently nobody has proposed one so far).
this new paper Problems in number theory from busy beaver competition 2013 by Michel a leading authority exhibits many such cases for low $x,y$ and shows the connection to general number theoretic sequences similar to the Collatz conjecture.
I know that the halting problem is undecidable in general but there are some Turing machines that obviously halt and some that obviously don't. Out of all possible turing machines what is the smallest one where nobody has a proof whether it halts or not?
actually research into this problem related to Busy Beavers suggests that there are are many such "small" machines lying on a hyperbolic curve where $x \times y$, $x$ states and $y$ symbols, is small. in fact it appears to be a general phase transition/boundary between decidable and undecidable problems.
