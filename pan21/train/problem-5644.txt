And the second question, about  changing the email.  Kinds of an open ended question considering the current state of the code.  The short simple explanation is to save the value of the cells to a variable or two and then use that variable in your email.
To answer the first question, is there a more efficient way?  The portion that you've shared appears to be run manually, meaning the program will not run unless you perform an action.  I would try to automate that task with an event driven process.  This can be done in a myriad of different ways and I'd need to know about l more about your workflow to gain any significant efficiency.
For example if you had a variable with the horrible name variableX and this variable held the range of  F3 then your email could use variableX.
Both codes above are located in the same module of my worksheet. The code worked absolutely fine to send an email (through Outlook) to the user. For example, if F3 and F7 evaluate to true, two emails will be sent to the user.
I personally do not have any VBA background, so it would be nice if you guys could explain it in layman's term. Thank you! Really appreciate it! :)
Now, here's the problem, how can I edit my code, such that if the same situation occurs (F3 and F7 evaluate to true), the two email sent to the user would specify which cell evaluates to true. In other words, each email sent would be different in pointing out which specific cell was evaluated to true.
Considering this was asked 2 years ago, I'm sure you've either solved the problem or moved on.  But this came to at the top of the unanswered list so... here-goes!
Is there a more efficient way to send email reminders to a user based on a cell value that changes frequently? Here's the code of what I'm working on so that you guys could understand the context of the question.
