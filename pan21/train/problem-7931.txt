I would not ban a failed CAPTACHA for an hour, that seems harsh, I would just prevent them moving forward until they successfully complete the CAPTACHA and allowing for a new CAPTACHA image to be shown.
You could also do a "forced" CAPTACHA every X times that an action is taken, this will prevent even an automated script with a pause built in so it doesn't trigger the time limit CAPTACHA.
In a game, I would recommend replacing "captcha" with "puzzle mini-game".  The difference being the level of fun involved.  There're really little reason for a captcha in a game unless you have tried a custom mini-game and that is still getting botted.  In which case make it require more intelligent tactics.
I would also only display the captcha if they making requests too quickly, I'd store the a DateTime on every request, and then compare it to the next request, if its less than 2-4 seconds, you display the CAPTACHA, otherwise let them go. You'll need to determine what a reasonable interval is for your game, server, and bandwidth. 
As suggested by Tchalvak, I would go the 'puzzle mini-game' route, however I would reward a few points for passing it so as to make it more user-friendly
