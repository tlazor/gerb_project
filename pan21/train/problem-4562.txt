Okay, so after answers posted and continued digging through the internet, I have found the solution...at least a temporary one. The answer is at: http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Permissions/130850/. The author details how to specifically find changes to logins using the default trace on the instance. This is great...sort of. The first problem is finding out how "busy" the instance is, which will affect the rate of rollover files created by the default trace. For example, I have one instance where the oldest rollover file is from 2/15. On another instance, the oldest rollover file is from 2 AM today. (!!!) So, to successfully gather any changes to logins, using this method, it has to be determined how often to execute the query...and dump the results into a table for later review.
For whodunnit, there's a profiler trace event "Audit Add Login to Server Role" under security. Presumably it catches ALTER and not just the SPs specified, but that would need to be tested.
I'd suspect the guilty once caught would start assigning specific permissions instead so would trace that too.
