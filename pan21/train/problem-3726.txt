If something is blocking the connection between the pieces of metal under the power button, it could be struggling to complete the circuit. Or, if one of the wires going from the power button to the power supply is loose or has a bad connection somewhere, the same thing could result.
Control Panel>Power Options>...top left "choose what the power buttons do">change settings that are currently available>...then UN-check "Turn on Fast Startup".
Most power buttons simply cause two pieces of metal to touch when you press the button. This completes a circuit which signals the power supply to turn on the rest of the computer.
If you press the power button kind of hard and wiggle your finger a bit for a couple of seconds, does it work better on the first try? If yes, then it is probably related to the power button itself. If this doesn't seem to help, try slightly squeezing the laptop (top and bottom) near where the power cord plugs in, and while doing that press the power button. If this helps, then the problem is probably closer to the power supply rather than the button.
