but it seems quite old. That in itself is not a problem, but I wanted to be sure that I have information that is relevant. Is this the best resource for understanding how postgresql processes queries (using plans, statistics etc.) or are there others?
The Postgres documentation is the best source for the most up-to-date information on how the system works -- second only to the code itself.
I'm looking for some up-to-date information about postgresql internals, specifically the query optimizer. I've found this link (referred to in the "Further Reading" section of the 8.4 docs):-
That being said, Your link is still valid for reference.  There's also http://neilconway.org/talks/optimizer/optimizer.pdf and all of section VII of the manual @ http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/interactive/index.html (Chapters 44, 50 & 56 may be of particular interest to you).
If you're looking for something more specific than that you'll have to narrow the scope of your question a bit more -- The query planner/optimizer is a pretty complex area and you really need to put a sharp point on your questions to avoid getting buried in information :-)
src/backend/optimizer/README contains a lot of information.  Many source files under that directory also contain big comments.  That's about as up-to-date and relevant as you can hope for.
