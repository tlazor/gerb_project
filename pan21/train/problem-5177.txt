Although I'm not familiar with SBS2003, I have been in similar situations where I had to manually edit or enter a batch of nearly identical items. If someone else doesn't provide a solution to directly edit the files, I recommend using AutoHotKey to automate the data entry as a workaround. It's a tool to record and play back mouse and keyboard events. It includes a script recorder which will let you run through the process once and output a script to reproduce your keyboard and mouse events. Then you can edit the script to read values from a CSV file and loop through the actions to do the data entry (see Loop command docs).
AutoHotKey also can create GUIs, so I recommend creating a simple GUI that shows all of the items read from the CSV file along with a button to click to process the selected entry. This is dead simple in AutoHotKey's language and only takes a few lines of code. Using the GUI will let you run through the process one by one in case something goes wrong in the middle of processing your entries.
