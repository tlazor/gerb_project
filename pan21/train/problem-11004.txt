When used and trusted by receiving servers, it can filter out messages that do not originate from you, but claim to.
The grand answer is "It Depends".  Correctly defined SPF records can help your mail be correctly categorized by many spam filters, but not all.  Spammers usually setup SPF records, so spam filtering companies don't blindly trust anyone who sets them up.  A good filter combines an SPF match, with a reputation system, so if you send clean mail, and you use SPF you are better off.
read the listing policies for http://www.rfc-ignorant.org/ and make sure your mail server isn't violating any of those rules.  Check your server to make sure it is minimally secure via a mail relay tester such as http://www.abuse.net/relay.html . 
It is therefore not relevant for trying to ensure mail that is sent from you is accepted.  That is a reputational issue.  Make sure your mail server is not on a declared-home-broadband-IP, which might be listed in a policy block list such as http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/ .  If you are trying to send mail from a residential IP, configure your MTA to route via a smarthost that isn't, such as your ISP.
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a scheme that lets domain owners/admins indicate which servers are permitted to send mail on behalf of their domain.
