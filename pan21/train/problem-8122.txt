what you are asking cannot be done with (2) separate computers. You would need 1 computer with a dual monitor output video card to run extended monitor support. You can though use 2 monitors next to each other and have a KVM switch so you click back and forth between computer towers.
I have two desktops each with single vga monitor output. I am interested to have an extended monitor setup, where i can extend the desktop of one of my machines and that way i can also work on the other using remote desktop. Any idea how can i do that? I am running Windows 7 on one and Win Server 2k8 on another.
I recommend the dual video output solution, as I am using the same solution. I run 1 tower and dual monitors. Good luck with your setup, if you have any more questions please do ask!
As Johannes RÃ¶ssel writes, Synergy is the undoubtedly cheapest and perhaps even the best solution to this problem. It's cross platform (Windwos, OS X and Linux), open source and (after a bit of configuration) completely invisible and easy to use.
Not quite sure how exactly you imagine this to work or look like. I can't quite make sense of it, but that may be the time of day here.
