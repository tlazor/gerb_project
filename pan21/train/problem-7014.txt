I've started trying to make a 2D game in C++ using OpenGL, and I'm using SOIL as the imaging loading library. The problem is, I've been trying to get a simple 64x64 image of a red square to open and display, but when I render it, I get a 64x64 white square.
Sorry for the long post, and any help would be greatly appreciated. You can find my entire solution on Github here.
I've used SOIL before to great effect to load textures for a 3D program I was working on earlier. I have copy-pasted code from that program into the new one, but the texture is not displaying for some reason. I've checked that it was loaded properly, and the ID is being set to a proper ID, and it's getting the dimensions correctly, just not the colors. Even more confusing, when I try to get the height and width of the texture, they are both returning 0.
I'm starting to believe more and more that its something I did wrong initializing the Orthographic Projection matrix, or something is missing from my OpenGL initialization code.
