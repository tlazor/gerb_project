But that was just the 2nd dumb thing here. The first was downloading a tool claiming to thaw a deep freeze machine. The only tool that can thaw deep freeze is deep freeze. Anything else is an unsupported crack that likely as not brought malware along for the ride.
Not that I expect you to know this, though: it's not very well published by faronics and I only learned the trick recently.
I'm sure you've reformatted by now, but for future reference: you hosed your machine the moment you deleted the file. At that point, Windows still needed the file to function properly, and when you removed (with no way to recover it) you rendered your system worthless.
DeepFreeze does not "format" but allows the system to remain in a specific state.  USer may be able to install software or malware but a reboot puts the system back to a "known good" state as configured by teh admin. 
What you should have done is go into your bios and set your system clock ahead by 60 days. That would have been a signal to deep freeze that it should boot thawed. This is the designed way that deep freeze provides for you to signal to a broken installation it should leave things in a state that allows you to fix it.
Normally DeepFreeze can easily be booted unfrozen without a special tool.  However, I have not used DeepFreeze for a while.  At this point you have likley rendered DeepFreeze unusable and a format is likley your best best.  By removing files, it is likley messed up beyond repair.  You might be able to connect the drive to another system to recover files.
