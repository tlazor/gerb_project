Also, assuming you have a hardware initiator, there's less TCP processing overhead in the OS kernel.
I was wondering if there are any major advantages of using the iSCSI protocol to access a NAS over a connection via FTP or SMB (besides access speeds, which would be higher with the use of the iSCSI protocol).
Finally, while this is minor, I might as well add, the iSCSI protocol has less enveloping/framing/etc. so will be (slightly) more efficient in terms of bandwidth than FTP/CIFS/NFS/etc.
As far as the rest of the OS is concerned, that's just another disk that it can write to and read from like any other, and the iSCSI driver encapsulates all of the network complexity into a presentation that other programs simply see as a disk. With SMB or FTP or what have you, each program has to store its own connection and authentication information somewhere, this gets out of sync, hair gets pulled out, teeth gnash, etc. The OS doesn't see this as a connection to somewhere else; it just sees it as a block device like any other.
With the help of  FTP, SMB, NFS multiple clients can access the same area, while with iSCSI typically only one system has access, unless you are using a clustered filesystem.
