I agree with AlexN.  For most home situations a personal firewall on your machine is totally not needed.  This is a different case if you were to put the machine into the DMZ of your network to act as a server(one that can be accessed from the outside like a webserver or a ssh server).  Though in most cases NAT would be more appropriate.  As stated above just make sure that that the firewall on the router is enabled, and keep the firmware up to date.  Exploits against the router are occasionally still possible, and the only way to patch them would be with a firmware update.  
I have a router, that has built in hardware firewall capabilities, do I need to install an additional software firewall on my Windows 7 PC like ZoneAlarm?
Just make sure your hardware firewall blocks anything except what you explicitly allowed to enter your network and you will be fine.
If you have your router properly configured, the Windows Firewall that comes with your Windows 7 will be good enough for most cases. Generally, I'd be more worried about malware sending out stuff then anything getting in, which I believe Windows Firwall will handle (it gives a pop "do you want to give ... access to the internet")
