My advice would be to install this software only if your computer / laptop is used by people who install software indiscriminately, visit high risk internet sites, or are prone to clicking on links in e-mails that claim to be your bank asking for you to "update your details."
As far as I can tell it verifies the SSL certificate of your bank's server (which I guess is the reason they customize it per banking institution, and prevents your account details from being snooped by browser plug ins / add ons.
The more insidious aspect hinted at on the Trusteer Rapport product overview page, is that the software immediately reports to your bank any potential breach in security. I have heard some (unverified by me) reports of banks freezing accounts upon getting one of these breach reports from the software.
I had the software installed but uninstalled it as I found it was constantly connecting to the internet whether I was browsing or not, connected to my bank's online services or not.
All I can find out from the banks and Trusteer is patronising explanations that it does all sorts of wonderful things like preventing phishing, encrypting data transmitted, blocking malware, solving world hunger, bringing about universal peace, now just install it and go back to your life, there, there. This is all very good for the average luddite, but I'm still mystified as to what Rapport does. What does it do that TLS doesn't do already? How does it do it? Perhaps more importantly, how obnoxious is it? Will I notice it when I'm not doing my online banking? Does it install stuff in the right places on a Mac? Is it easily uninstallable?
Recently, both of my banks have been trying to foist Trusteer Rapport on me when accessing their online banking services. I haven't downloaded it because I can't figure out what it actually does, and I'm wary of it being some enormous piece of obnoxious, clunky, badly-written, distribute-stuff-all-over-the-system bloatware*.
