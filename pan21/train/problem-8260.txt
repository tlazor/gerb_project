Large enterprise systems are by default protected even from the possible root hacks by the access control systems such as RBAC or some variant of MAC. Sleske's comment supports this statement. Check Wiki for more details. However, if you are user on the smaller or medium size system you must that must have "all-mighty but not trusted" root account you have to develop "double-books" system based on the autonomous virtual machine in charge of the user session and another virtual machine in charge of the root's server session. 
I'm not sure that any solution is going to work.  What's to stop root signing in or su'ing to your user?  Even if you require a password to be typed in the root user could easily set up a keylogger to trap it.  The solution, if you don't trust the root user of the server you're using, is to use a different server.
If you don't trust the administrators you're out of options - there's always a way for them to get to the data as they control your hardware and your infrastructure.
Is there a way to add another layer of protection to avoid that, perhaps by encrypting them, but allowing smooth on-the-fly decrypting when programs run by me request them?
