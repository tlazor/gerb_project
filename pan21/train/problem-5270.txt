Anytime a collision is detected on an Ethernet line, any and all interfaces on that line are required to stop transmitting.  They each then come up with a random amount of time to wait before transmitting again, in an attempt to avoid another collision.  In a crowded network, this delay will start to add up very quickly, and the collision domain is essentially the sum total of equipment that delay affects.
The collision domain is the sum total of the network segment (hosts, hubs) affected by the collision, and forced to deal with it by a random backoff delay.
As in your quote, it comes up a lot less these days.  The original Ethernet gear that filled the role of the switch was a hub, which simply repeated any frame sent to it out all of the other ports.  Once a network got even lightly congested, this made collisions a common symptom.  Modern switch technology virtually eliminates that problem, since any frame received by the switch is only sent to the host it's intended for.  The only possible collision is between a host and the switch, making it a very small collision domain, affecting only that host.
