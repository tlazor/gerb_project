The more you stick with Codd's rules and sound design principles the better. Relational algebra is the only framework out there with a sound mathematical foundation. This is unlike your Hadoops and MongoDBs which, while useful for ad-hoc niche data analysis, are not on a firm theoretical footing.
Please make the effort and take the time to have a good framework for analysing/querying your data - you'll only end up with a lot of grief (poor performance, redesigns, complex queries).
Also, check out this article in The Register for some of the rationale behind Codd's efforts to impose some sort of discipline on data modelling and storage.
You will of course need an extra field to ensure the uniqueness of every record but this will pay itself back in spades down the road. I would just remark as an aside that the field name "id" is, more or less by convention, used for PRIMARY KEYs in MySQL - it's not an obligation though.
I've always thought that it was quite insecure but I've recently heard about normalization and I suppose that the table above ought be something like this (correct me if I'm wrong)
