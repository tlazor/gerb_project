Now I'm giving software support in a company, where customers are using virtual Windows machines for running our software, and there has been the issue where the virtual machine was that much occupied that an RDP (remote desktop) was not possible anymore, so the customer has simply decided to restart the virtual machine, leaving me with no clue about what happened and, as a result, no possibility to avoid the issue from happening again.
I could, however, plug a cable into another entry, and use some kind of "console" (a command prompt), from where I still did have access to the machine, and from there, some basic analysis (like a top or a df -hk command) could still be done.
I used to be a hardware support engineer for UNIX servers. At that time, it happened regularly that a server was that busy that it had become impossible to log in, so doing regular analysis was impossible.
Does anybody know the name of the feature and if there's a way to configure this for the mostly used VM software packages (HyperV, vSphere, ...)?
In my opinion, there should be something similar than the hardware console of the UNIX servers, but I don't know the name of this feature, and I have no idea on how to configure it (is it possible to reserve some virtual machine's memory/CPU for this console and how to do this). In top of that, I don't even know what VM software the customer is using.
