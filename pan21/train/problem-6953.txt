Firstly, I apologize if this is in the wrong forum; I didn't see one that clearly pertained to mobile administration. This is for an iPhone since that's relevant.
Without a third-party app, yes; you're right.  The only thing I'd change is start the forwarding first, then dump and delete, then disable AD account or change its password.
I will be assisting in the termination of a user that uses their own, personal phone for Exchange 2007. I'd like to get all the contacts/calendar/email data off of their phone, but Remote Wipe is a murky option since it isn't a company phone. The solution I'm currently looking at is using an Outlook client to export their OST to a PST, then wiping everything from their account with that client, in the hopes that the phone would then sync the now-empty profile; a few hours later we could just change the user's AD password and then do mail forwarding. I'm still very new to Exchange though, and I feel there's probably a better way to do this that I'm missing.
