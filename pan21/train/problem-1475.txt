You can POST to every page to get things to update, but thats annoying for the user (effectivly a page refresh everytime) and doesn't seperate concerns! 
So you have attempted autoloading, thats great! But by modern standards you should be using composer to; 
There are many design paterns you can use to implement applications, and you've gone for dependency injection, which is great! 
There is far to much out of date code for me to sit here and try and improve when the concepts are flawerd. I would recomend you read up on modern PHP techniques and try applying some of them.
Your controller router is going to be one of the more diffuclt classes to write, but it should be a lot of fun. 
Modern PHP should conform to standrads such as the PSR's your namespace is simply model this isn't good enough, take a look at PSR4, your namespaces should be something like Script47\MVC_FRAMEWORK_NAME\Models
You should make ajax requests (a HTTP request) to your "api" which your index & your new ControllerRouter should be handling and returning prefferably JSON to the client. 
Symfony has series on creating your own framework, I have never used it and its ideas and opions may conflict with my own, but you should follow their guide more than my advice
