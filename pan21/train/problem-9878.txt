I have a similar problem with our cable provider - the gateway may be reachable but the rest of the internet is not.  I used traceroute to find a pingable host on the edge of the providers network as a test host for pings.  You do do the same to find a host as a ping test destination / static route candidate.
You can test by changing the default gateway (by using route del default && route add default gw 2.2.2.2 ) and tracroute to 9.9.9.9
It may be a next hop in traceroute after the gateway (you don't ever talk to that router anyway). Or just a service you'd never use over GPRS (e.g. streaming video).
with policy-routing you can use different routing tables depending on mark [ fwmark ] set in iptables. you can set different mark for the same host but different port numbers [ maybe you can run couple of test-services on your destination server on different ports ]... 
Now it's up to you to write a script that detect if ping to 9.9.9.9 failed and change the default gateway accordingly. When ping to 9.9.9.9 failed, your script should change the default gateway so that traffic will get routed to the backup link. However, because of the rule and table we just added, ping (or any traffic) to 9.9.9.9 will still be routed thru the primary link.
