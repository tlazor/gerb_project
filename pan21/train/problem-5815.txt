One of the adapters is a little older than the other, and can only see 2.4 GHz networks. So I obviously want that one to connect to ChurchInternet. That first adapter is called Wireless Connection 13
My church has two separate wireless networks, one called ChurchInternet which broadcasts on a 2.4 GHz frequency and another called ChurchAudio which broadcasts on a 5 GHz frequency. Both are broadcast by (separate) Linksys routers. ChurchInternet is connected to the Internet while ChurchAudio has no Internet connectivity and is used for connecting to the sound equipment (we have a nice new mixer). We don't want anyone connecting to the ChurchAudio (which is why it's separate), but we do allow people with the password to connect to ChurchInternet.
The second (newer) adapter is capable of seeing both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. So that has to be the one to connect to the 5 GHz ChurchAudio network. That one is called Wireless Connection 5
We've got a desktop computer running Windows 7 in the church that we would like to be able to connect to both. This computer has two separate USB wireless adapters.
