Most URI schemes don't have standard provisions for containing a whole other URI, so you wouldn't think of them as prefixing another whole URI. Besides http: and https:, some common URI schemes include:
I don't think that the link to npmjs that Masoud provided is very useful. It directs you to a Javascript library on the library host npmjs. The blob-util library is used to wrap around the standard API in the browser to work with blobs and it simplified writing code for these things, but it is not a good reference to understand the blob URLs and what they are.
The blob: prefix is new to me and I want to know if it works across all browsers, and what other prefixes might exist.
I'm using safari, and unsure if this works in other browsers, but when I signed up for a storm path account, I see the following URL
MDN is a good resource for understanding things in plain language. I would also suggest https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL as a good resource. They also show the W3C specification at the bottom of their page, the same one as Spiff provided, but the original specifications can be verbose and difficult to read. I would say Spiff is the most correct for linking you to the W3C docs.
Blob URI/URL was created by JavaScript, refers to data that your browser currently has in memory (only in current page), and does not refer to data the exists on the host.
The start of a URL up to the first colon is called a "URI scheme" (or "URL scheme"). Googling for blob URI scheme reveals the W3C's File API efforts.
