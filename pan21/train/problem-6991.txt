I'm migrating a CentOS 5.3 system from MySQL to PostgreSQL.  The way our machine is set up is that the biggest disk partition is mounted to /home.  This is out of my control and is managed by the hosting provider.  Anyway, we obviously want the database files to be on /home for this reason.
Also make sure that the postgresql daemon is running in the right domain (ie SELinux context). You might quickly find that it is not by tailing the logs, see below. see run_init for details on kicking off an init script so that it is in the right domain. posgresql might be running as unconfined_t (in which case there shouldn't be a problem, unconfined gets to do a lot).
EDIT:  The reason my question specifically mentions the /home directory is that if I go through all these steps for any other directory, e.g. /var/lib/pgsql2 or /usr/local/pgsql, then it works as expected.
Even if you have labeled the directories correctly, it is quite possible that the selinux policy forbids postgresql from acessing /home itself (the link mentioned in @Milen's answer, in fact, seems to imply that).
I made sure all the permissions are correct (600 for files and 700 for directories), as well as the ownership (postgres:postgres).
The weird thing is that I don't see any messages related to this in /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure, but if I turn off SElinux, then everything works.
If the label isn't right there are various ways to change it. A quick google gave me http://docs.fedoraproject.org/selinux-user-guide/f10/en-US/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-SELinux_Contexts_Labeling_Files-Persistent_Changes_semanage_fcontext.html
There may be other issues with SELinux for further analysis try tailing the audit log. (note that the audit log isn't written to until auditd is up, I've been bitten by that before. In that case check /var/log/messages for pre auditd log messages)
