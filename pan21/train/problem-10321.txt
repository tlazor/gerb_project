I'm now stuck at the point where I've got to configure it. The problem being, that I can access some files in the directory, and I cannot access other files.
I'm getting the strangest problem with Apache installation. I've installed IctFax according to instructions provided here.
Please check your SeLinux settings, if found enabled then disable it and reboot your system and then try again.
Just guessing, it's been a long time since I worked seriously with Apache.  The example you're giving of a file that does not open is a php file.  The other files in the ictfax directory that you say open are html and text.  zz.php is in a different directory.  It's dangerous to extrapolate from one data point, but are the "many other" files in that directory also php files?
The server opens xx.html, zz.php, INSTALL.txt, but it does not open index.php or many other files in the catalog.
If I remember correctly, Apache configuration for a directory tree does not necessarily apply past symlinks. So it's a possibility that /usr/ictfax/wwwroot does not have php enabled even though your main wwwroot directory does.  In that case, another <Directory> section in your config, enabling php for the /usr/ictfax/wwwroot directory, might help.
