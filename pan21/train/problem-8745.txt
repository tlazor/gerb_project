If your home network gets a /64 subnet from the ISP, you don't need NAT. And ISPs usually get a /32 allocation (even tiny organizations get a /48 by default), so technically they have no reason not to give out /64's or even /56's (good enough for 256 subnets per customer) to every single customer they have.
However, I've already heard rumors of ISPs which continue with their IPv4 practice of giving out only a single IP address per customer, and selling /64 blocks as an extra feature/addon. So if you end up in that situation, you still need NAT...
IPv6 doesn't have an address shortage problem, and there is currently no NAT for IPv6, although there is an experimental RFC for people who just can't give it up.
NAT is a wonderful concept used in ipv4. It is the major reason for the existence on internet, in my concerns. There are no networks in the world that doesn't work without employing NAT.
NAT is a kludge in IPv4 to get around the IPv4 address shortage while waiting for IPv6 to become ubiquitous. I certainly wouldn't use the word wonderful. NAT breaks the original IP paradigm of end-to-end connectivity, and many workarounds have been needed due to NAT.
All I seek to know is that, would NAT be required if after ipv6 is implemented, would NAT be eliminated or be used in a different way(Transformed or Upgraded into a new version with some added abilities to tackle any situations or problems that the network specialists or researchers foresee).
