if you are after a headless / commandline version of Linux (which uses yum or redhat / fedora like) install CentOS.  
I have a CD with the standard 64-bit version of Fedora 13. I want to install it on a VirtualBox VM for local web development testing. How can I install it without Gnome and all the extra content that goes along with the Gnome environment?
The LiveCD has a fixed configuration that it copies over to the hard drive, and isn't truly an install CD/DVD. 
At any rate, I had to just uninstall them after the OS was completely installed, and once that was done I still had to change the default runlevel. Talk about a pain, but at least it's working.
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Installation_Quick_Start_Guide/images/pkgselection/pkg-group.png Select Customize now (at the bottom) and than remove the Gnome/KDE and the xserver package.
During installation I watched for an opportunity to modify the packages to be installed, but I never saw it. I'm sure I just missed it; however I did notice a few people saying that they'd tried blocking X/Gnome from installation but it installed them anyway. Something about Fedora being intended as a Desktop environment, not a Server. Go figure.
If you have the Gnome LiveCD - the short answer is that you probably can't (or at least you'll have to install, and the uninstall Gnome.
