The only way I found is to click on the file in File Explorer and check the status bar: it will say "Available Offline" if the file is synced, or "Available Online" if it is on the cloud (and the local file is only a shortcut).
It gets updated when OneDrive is syncing, checking the status and mapping of online files and when it's done synchronizing. (One little caveat, though: OneDrive won't update the log, when the only file to sync is blocked by a file handle.)
To get the details of synchronization, launch the SkyDrive app (from the Windows 8.1 Start Screen). 
There are also other interesting variables you can utilize, like FilesToDownload and FilesToUpload and so on.
In windows explorer look to the left pane where the list of libraries is displayed beneath the Onedrive.  At the bottom of the pane you will see a download/upload status- eg Downloaidng 5 GB of 10 GB (50% done) 
It's not the way I like the most, because I have non-constant internet connection. But for always-on devices and ultrabooks/tablets with limited disk-space it actually makes sense. I just wish MS would have explained this change more clearly BEFORE, because if I knew this I would never have updated to 8.1...
From File Explorer you can right click the file or folder and choose "Make available Offline", which will download the file. Or "Make available online only", this will create the shortcut and free-up some disk space.
Unlike Windows 8, where synchronized files have an icon overlay. In Win8.1, no icon means it's synchronized.
So if the file that's linked to SkyDrive has no overlay icon, this means the content is synchronized.  If the icon has a gray synchronization overlay, it means it's not yet completed synchronizing.
This will show you a summary of synchronization is shown which, if clicked, then shows details of files waiting to be uploaded and downloaded.
