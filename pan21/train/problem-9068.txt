About google scholar. Not all the hiring committee will use it, but you will always have someone that will do. Most probably your strongest ally and your opponents : the first to find some evidence that you are good, the others for the contrary.
So, finally my advice is to always show ALL your publications, but in a list with clear category : journal/conf/other stuff, and field by field if necessary. And keep in mind that in a hiring committee, there is always someone in charge of verifying that list.
Don't confuse good (resp. poor) papers and good (resp. weak) conferences/journals. IMHO, there is no such thing as a weak conference or journal (BTW it is not really true, there are terrible conf. and journals, but that can be easily detected since they are basically frauds maintained by crooks). There is only good, weak, false etc. papers. Of course some conferences/journals have mainly "good" papers. But what is a good paper ? If you are young, it is likely that nobody can really assess the global merit of your papers, unless you solve some long-standing problem. But it is surely possible to assess your technical merit, your work integrity (in applied fields), your seriousness, your ability to communicate,etc. 
Never underestimate hiring committee members. It is likely that any manipulation you can think of, they will think of as well. They are more experienced than you and they already saw various types (all types ?) of applications.
Sure, if you have papers in various fields, some persons can say that you have a lack of focus, while others will take that as an opportunity to broaden the scope of their team. At the end of the day, it is more a matter of how balanced your application is, on how known your results/you are, etc.
