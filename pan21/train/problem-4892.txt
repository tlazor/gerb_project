Best practice would be an automatic deployment system that exports and publishes after a SVN update is made. Consider Hudson for example. There are few more, but as we do not need one, I'm not very well informed
Rsync allows you to mirror directories on one server with directories on another.  It calculates a delta between the two servers and only copies the differences.  Not only that, but it compresses the delta and, optionally, can encrypt it too.
From your comments it appears that you are using the wrong tool for the job.  Subversion is a great tool for your developers, but it's not a deployment/mirroring tool.  If your goal is to simply copy files from your staging/test server to your production server with a minimum of bandwidth and time, then I suggest you use rsync.  Now, since I'm a Unix admin, there may be some Windows equivalent to rsync that I don't know about, so you may want to do some research.  However, you can use rsync under Cygwin or cwrsync.
If removing the files isn't an option, you could put basic security on the directories through IIS (password, or IP restrictions). This would stop IIS from serving content to unauthorized users. 
I schedule a script on my production servers that searches for .svn and simply deletes the files. I don't think this will work in your case.
