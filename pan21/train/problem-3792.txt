SD card speed class rating specifies minimal read/write performance the card should have while recording video. Class number is the lower speed limit in MB/s you should get when using the card.
So in your situation, it seems that your card has really bad performance on your Mac Book Air while it has proper (and realistic) performance on RaspberryPi. We can't be sure, however, since you tested write speed on Mac Book and read speed on RaspberryPi and as I mentioned earlier, they are not comparable. It's also hard to comment on why you're getting such results since you didn't specify how are you testing those speeds.
Speed of reading/writing can be limited not only by a card but also by a lot of different factors, both hardware and software. Especially it can be limited by some problems with card reader/writer.
Keep in mind, however, that reading from card is usually much simpler (and thus faster) than writing. This is why usual class 6 card will have 6MB/s write speed by 15-20 MB/s read speed (but only 6MB/s is warranted).
