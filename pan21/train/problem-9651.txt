I have this old Asus X200MA laptop motherboard and while changing the CR2032 CMOS battery I found out that the old battery popped out fine, but the new battery does not fit in tightly in the same spot. I have also tried inserting the old battery as well just to rule out size mismatch.
I don't know that particular clip, so this is a pure guess, but it perhaps looks like the tabs designed to hold the edge of the battery in may have disintegrated & broken away.
See all the snaps and guide me please. Using an insulating tape is my last option to hold it in place.
Press hard, its a tight fit, but that is what keeps it from failing out. When inserted it will be flush with the plastic holder all the way around the circumference.
It seems there might have been something in there tightly holding it in place. But I did not see anything broken anywhere while popping out the old one.
See how it floats from a side. When I turn the board upside down which is its default placement, the battery just falls.
