You may be rightfully reluctant to repair the filesystem: there is a very small, but existing, chance that the repair could happen catastrophically.  The best way to protect yourself from that is to have all important data backed up.  Make sure that your backups are in good shape before you repair the filesystem.
I couldn't find anymore options, so before reformatting or repairing my filesystem (fsck might help) I thought maybe there is something I missed.
Nope,  you've been thorough.  It looks like there an issue with a part of the filesystem.  You could repair it.  Or you could think about what other fun you'd like to do.  However, the simple thing is to repair it.
Note that playing with damaged data also presents possible risk of causing further filesystem problems, so if you're trying to be safe, then the safe thing is to perform the preliminary checking (which you already did) and then just take care of the problem (after verifying backups).
Then, start the repair.  When you know what to do, sometimes you just need the guts to proceed.  You may find that this is entirely resolved in under half a second.  (Or maybe a bit longer if there's some overhead...  3 seconds.)
