Ehh, based on the information provided, it could be the graphics card... but I don't suppose you wrote down what actually failed and caused the BSOD? This would confirm what it is.
Also, can you see the BIOS fine? Does the green start during or only after Windows has loaded (in safe mode)?
I rebooted the computer and for a short while everything was fine, I accessed the external harddrive via usb WHICH had just be formatted and BANG, screen display went again, and after the monitor flashing on them off for about 3 times, I got the blue screen of death. NIGHTMARE. Now when I reboot even in bios, there is random green blocks and static everywhere. It will not start up except in safe mode, and when it safe mode, there is random blocks of green everywhere?
After cleaning temporary files with disk cleanup, and also after doing a complete computer backup with Windows Vista, all of a sudden the display on BOTH monitors just went west, it was so bad I could not navigate my desktop as everything was just a static mess.
if it is something Nvidia/ATI related it most likely is as doing a backup should not do anything to cause a crash like what you say.
