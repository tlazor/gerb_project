I've seen multiple brand new motherboards die needlessly from people reusing the power supply after their original motherboard mysteriously dies. 
From the picture, that looks like a transistor, or a mosfet, but you'll need to take a picture with a macro lens to find someone who really knows for sure. Try and see what the numbers are on the front of the neighboring, still unburned parts. 
Typically Intel does make high quality parts, Don't let one isolated incident convince you that all products of one company are bad. Remember that motherboard manufactures make millions of motherboards, and purchase 10's of millions of desecrate components. It is impossible to guarantee that 100% of the parts are defect free. 
As a personal rule, If I ever see a motherboard die, I error on the side of caution and assume it is the power supplie's fault, and dispose of it. 
My guess is that you simply got unlucky and received a motherboard with a desecrate component outside of the lower acceptable limit, that was not caught in intel's testing. 
In 15 years of working on computers, and electronics, I've only seen burns like that once. In that situation it was caused by a small metal shaving landing on a high power mosfet and shorting the pins.
