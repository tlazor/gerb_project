If you're browsing via a proxy that you control, block whatever URL you don't want to see in the proxy. This may require a zeroth step of installing a web proxy; what software to use would depend on your OS and level of technical expertise. This is completely browser independent (as long as you keep the browser configured to use the proxy, of course). This will not work for https because the proxy only sees encrypted traffic, it doesn't see what URL you request.
I want block a URL on specific computer, in this case www.google.com/reader but i not want to block the entire domain of google. It is for my work machine as I don't seem to have enough self control sometimes at work not to browse. 
You could configure your proxy settings to use a nonexistent proxy for the URLs you don't want to be able to access. For firefox, FoxyProxy is a possibility (I'm sure there are others); it's easy to set up, but it's also easy to work around. A more general method, which works in just about any browser that supports javascript, is to write a proxy autoconfiguration file.
