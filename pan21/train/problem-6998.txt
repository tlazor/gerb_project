It is currently rather pricy, but the hope is that other providers would start offering similar certificates and reduce prices.
You can get a wildcard (*.domain.com) but you will also need *.www.domain.com as a alternative subject name entry to get this to work. The only companies that I know offer this are ssl.com and digicert. There may be others but I'm not sure. 
If the Wildcard SSL certificate is issued on *.sub1.domain.com, in that case you can secure all second level subdomains which are listed under the sub1.domain.com
This certificates says it will support yourdomain.com, *.yourdomain.com, *.*.yourdomain.com and so on.
If you want to secure limited number of sub domains and second level domains, then you can choose multi domain SSL that can secure up to 100 domain names with a single certificate.
What you can do is something like *.domain.com and then *.www.domain.com or *.mail.domain.com. I've never seen *.*.domain.com on a production site. 
I was just doing some research on this as I have the same requirements to secure sub subdomains as well and came across a solution from DigiCert.
Internet Explorer behaves in the way outlined by the RFC, where each level needs its own wildcarded certificate.  Firefox is happy with a single *.domain.com where * matches anything in front of domain.com, including other.levels.domain.com, but will also handle the *.*.domain.com types as well.
When Wildcard SSL certificate is issued for *.domain.com, you can secure your unlimited number of sub domains over the main domain.
