The jumplist's purpose is not to help you jump from buffer to buffer: it records all the jump motions you do. Since typical vim usage includes lots of jumps within and across buffers, it would be a mistake to use it to navigate between buffers.
Vim has the buffer list which, as the name implies, is a list of all your buffers and comes with a bunch of navigation commands of its own. Unfortunately, this list is "static": you can navigate to the previous buffer in the list but not to the previously accessed buffer. Vim doesn't keep such a list.
I had the exactly same issue and found that EnhancedJump plugin is quite large and requires an even larger depency. I wrote a small function that computes the number of <C-O>/<C-I> needed to jump to a different buffer than the current one. The jumplist stays clean, mapping it to <leader><C-O>/<C-I> fits my needs in a minimal way.
I am not sure if I got you right. You want to jump between files/buffers, not the positions in jumplist. (which could be many positions in same file)
Don't forget to replace ^O and ^I on line 4 by the real CTRL+o and CTRL+i characters with CTRL+v. I don't know why but the strings "<C-O>" and "<C-I>" didn't work when executing the normal! command.
I navigate buffers with names. But it could probably be doable to write a function that filers the jumplist and navigates to the first different buffer. I can't do that on this phone right now but I don't think it would be too hard.
