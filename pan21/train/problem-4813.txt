Snapshotting the pool seems to be a reliable way to do backups, but keep in mind that you gotta snapshot both the data pool and the metadata pool, and both snapshots need to be taken at the same time, in order to get a consistent snapshot of the filesystem. What's worse, you will need to combine both snapshots and make a new filesystem with them in order to get a single file or directory from the snapshot, but multi-fs is not yet implemented, AFAIK, in ceph. So your only way to do a recover may be overwriting the current filesystem with the snapshot entirely.
Firstly, snapshot in CephFS is available, but not yet stable. With allow_new_snaps set, snapshot will be enabled in CephFS, and making snapshots is as easy as creating a directory. Besides being not stable, what I've found is that files in snapshots still seem to be changing as the files in filesystem change, but haven't got a clue about this.
Well I was wondering about the usage and mechanism of CephFS snapshot and the search results brought me here.
