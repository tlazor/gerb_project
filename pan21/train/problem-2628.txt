QoS will indeed prioritize your traffic, but only up until it hits the gateway. Once it leaves the router and heads towards the first hop, nothing is prioritized any longer. As far as your ISP is concerned, it is all standard data traffic and any tagging your router applies is inconsequential. If your circuit is over-utilized by too much traffic, it will remain that way and you will still have the same problem. You will only solve your problem by limiting bandwidth usage per client through the WAN so that the phone always has a reserved amount in which to transfer data across the circuit. Incoming VoIP traffic will still be fighting for upload speed (say if you have an asymmetric circuit, you may only have a fraction of your download speed set for upload, ie a 6.0/1.0 adsl circuit). If this is the case, then QoS will help a bit, but again, only if he circuit is not being over-utilized.
It is also important to note that everything I have mentioned above will still only affect the VoIP packets on your particular circuit, not when they reach a peered network or the ISP on the other side, so you still may have issues.
BillP3rd's answer will help you with setting up QoS, but this will not solve your call quality problem.
The fact that you will be connecting wirelessly will also have an effect, as wireless communications with VoIP usually end in some sort of call quality problem. When I worked as tier 2 support for VoIP for an ISP, we would not troubleshoot call quality problems over a wireless connection because there were too many internal variables that could wreak havoc on a VoIP call. Wireless with data isn't as a big a deal, but with VoIP is isn't just about bandwidth, latency can obliterate a VoIP call and you will almost always see higher latency over wireless than wired (in a soho setting anyway).
