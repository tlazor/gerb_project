Here is the full command used to launch the IDE process on my machine (discovered via the excellent Process Explorer). Obviously your own will be slightly different.
You can pin NetBeans to the taskbar and take advantage of other Windows 7 features by using free SevenBeans module. 
It turned out shortcuts are limited to a certain number of characters as well, and all that wouldn't fit. I tried creating an environment variable to hold it all instead, but it turned out environment variables were of limited length as well (though not as drastically), so I ended up creating two of them.
On the machine where "everything works" I had installed a 32-bit Java runtime, but on the "faulty machine" I had installed the full 64-bit JDK.
Netbeans.exe is a custom launcher written in C++. It's a 32-bit module. When it loads, it first tries to load Java as a DLL into itself and then start NetBeans. However, if the Java runtime is 64-bit, it cannot do that because a 32-bit module cannot load a 64-bit module and vice-versa. Thus it falls back to starting Java as a separate process (javaw.exe) with the right parameters.
I ended up with a shortcut target of "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_17\jre\bin\javaw.exe" %NB_PARAMS1% %NB_PARAMS2% starting in "C:\Program Files\NetBeans 6.8\" and that seems to work just fine.
