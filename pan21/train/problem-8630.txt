I know network devices such as Junpier's SSL gateway devices do something similar, you log into a web portal and it "rewrites" all data to and from to sources on the LAN side of the gateway.
We are being forced to install a component of a system that has a strictly HTTP login method. Vendor has stated it was 'Designed to be an internal application and not designed for internet access." like LAN app are somehow immune to credential theft, etc...  Here not there, they will not budge, and I have no choice because we have no alternative at the moment. The service is on the other side of a VPN to make it worse, and I only control one side's networking.
I know this would only encrypt the traffic to and from my clients, but I could then firewall the remote IP to where communication could only come from my one host, and that reduces my overall places to intercept data form n<>1 to 1.
Is there a service out there that would allow me to designate an IP on my network to impersonate the remote server, where an HTTPS session could be established, and have that system exclusively communicate with the remote?
