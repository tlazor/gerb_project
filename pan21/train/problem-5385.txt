If you're in a console and can't even see what you're doing because of the messages try typing this.
When the kernel cmdline includes the quiet kernel parameter the resulting console log level is 4 (i.e. errors and worse). Without it it is set to 7 (i.e. info and worse).
If you are in a real jam you could just disable the syslog service temporarily in the case that there is such a flood that you cannot view or type anything properly.
You can view the active kernel parameters with cat /proc/cmdline and your current console log level with sysctl kernel.printk. It can be dynamically changed with dmesg -n X (or even with sysctl -w).

To make the change permanent you can add kernel parameters to kernel cmdline (e.g. quiet and/or loglevel=X) or add a sysctl .conf file under /etc/sysctl.d.
What you see are kernel log messages printed to the console. What log messages reach the console depends on the currently set console log level.
As this is a stack overflow related site, I'll start by saying you shouldn't switch off the output, you should address the errors.
