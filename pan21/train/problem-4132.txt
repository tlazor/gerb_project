I do not recommend trying to transcode the video because then the Pi's CPU's go working on overtime.
Could it be something as simple as the camera being recognized as something other than /dev/video0? Does ls /dev/video* yield anything else?
I have to transcode the raw audio and I found it tricky to get vlc 2.2.1 built for Raspbian to be tricky -- I end up using mp2a audio.
The C920's H.264 encoder is good but its rate seems only works at 3 Mb/s average bit rate no matter what the resolution. However, I tend to use 720p, that is 1280x720 because a 16:9 aspect ratio makes sense for the application.
to get the device names. Now, I found the name "plughw:CARD=C920,DEV=0" which arecord described as "Hardware device with all software conversions"
VLC's rtp server seemed lousy. VLC's Transport Stream (ts) is decent. These steps are for using the camera's internal H.264 encoder (pixelformat=1):
It's been many months since I used a C920 on my Raspberry Pi, but at the time, everything "just worked" so long as I used the right device.
I spent a number of hours recently with my C920 and a Raspberry Pi 3 recently to make a babyCam that I could stream within my home network. I may be able to shed some light but also provide documentation and experience to other users.
My guess is that there are no drivers installed for the Logitech c920 on my pi, but I'm not sure.  How would I download drivers or what should I do to be able to use my webcam?   The c920 is on the list of approved webcams, I have nothing else being powered by my pi so I should have enough power output to take  a simple picture.
