I'm trying to work with my DNS provider but they just send me to reference docs that I've already looked over. Perhaps the DNS entry is just taking a while to update. But I created the CNAME about 10 hours ago which I think is ample time. I've read around this site and the net and it seems like CNAMES sometimes can't be used for www but instead are for subdomains. I'm pretty new to this so any advice is appreciated.
Right now I've added a CNAME alias where "host" is "www" and "points to:" is "http://www.something.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/". I've double checked my S3 bucket: it's named "www.something.com", the website feature is enabled and all files are public. Browsing to "http://www.something.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/" works fine.
I want to host my static site www.something.com on Amazon S3. I've followed these instructions however I'm still having trouble. Specifically when I browse to www.something.com I'm sent to whatever my previous host has for the site. I think the problem is related to "DNS CNAME alias" however today is the first time I've heard about CNAMES so I'd love some help.
