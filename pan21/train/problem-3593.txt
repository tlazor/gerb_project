This will be fairly "realistic" (as far as zombies go) because players usually don't look at enemies for a long time (they usually run from them/attack them).
No pathfinding, let them get stuck.  That's how zombies should behave.  If there's enough of them the crowd will fill in any dead ends and force the additional zombies to go around so they can actually get to the character.
Something interesting may be to have different target checks. Not just if a zombie sees you, but perhaps if you wandered an area you could leave a 'scent trail', putting a zombie into the LOST state? Or if you fired a large weapon, the zombie would be attracted to your position in the LOST state? This second one could have an area-of-effect radius, giving a swarm-type pattern since all the zombies will end up in one area, and then move as one.
You may be over-engineering it, a basic implementation is just a state machine with a state "Shamble" which will cause the zombie to move around a bit (checking it won't hit walls and such perhaps, or stay out of the light etc, it can be expanded upon) and a "Follow" which will cause the zombie to move toward a player (maybe using path finding like A*) and attack him/her if the zombie gets to close.
As for implementing, it wouldn't be much more than having a check to see if the player has been seen, then some very dirty pathfinding - quick and dirty rather than something like A* - a zombie isn't going to go the optimal route - and a state machine. Just make sure that your random walk does have some form of obstacle avoiding - I really hate it when enemies just run into buildings for ages. ;-)
As for the target searching, each zombie could have a field-of-vision check. If target can be seen, change state and set the direction to go.
I'm taking all my zombie-related facts from the Zombie Survival Handbook. Which, on a tangent, is a very entertaining read.
