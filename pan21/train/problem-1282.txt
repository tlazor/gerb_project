I went ahead and uninstalled one of them and I no longer seem to be having the double click event problem.
I've corrected my issue (or it seems to have improved) by disabling the power management settings on each USB Root Hub device in Device Manager (devmgmt.msc)
I was just having the same issue in Windows 10, and noticed in the Device Manager that I had two HID-compliant mouse entries under the "Mice and other pointing devices" tab.
It's my opinion this is a windows problem. In the device manager I uninstalled all mouse HID (including the hiding devices) except the mouse I was using. This solved the problem.
Previously I had tried other mouses but had the same symptoms (or similar) problem. I suspected this was not a hardware problem since I run 2 computers with the same mouse and keyboard using a USB commutation device. The computer with Linux did not display the ''one click'' problem but the one with Win10 did.
There's a small program called MouseFix written by Daniel Jackson (source code available), that's implements a global mouse hooks that filters the redundant clicks based on a threshold. The essential logic looks like this:
It's a long shot, but the following worked for me (on Windows 8.1, but as it appears to be a hardware problem, it doesn't really matter).
