I checked for updates again and this time it told me about SP1 and a few more updates, which I tried to install, the installation was taking an extremely long time and failed the first time, on the second attempt they succeeded, but the problem has not been resolved, I am still getting intermittent freezes in several applications.
Three days ago I installed Windows 7 Professional (32-bit) on my 2-yr-old machine (it was a clean install on a new drive, not an upgrade install). The installation went quite smoothly, then I installed all the 'important' windows updates, then a bunch of applications (VS2010, Skype, Chrome, GTalk, Steam), all of which were working fine for about a day, no performance problems to speak of, I also installed the latest ATI Catalyst video drivers, downloaded from ATI's website.
Microsoft Security Essentials is an antivirus program.  Did you already have an antivirus program installed when you installed this?  If so, it seems likely they are arguing over locking files.
Check if the system log has any errors related to hard disk bad sectors. Download the free Sea Tools (by Seagate) for MS-DOS, burn an ISO and run the extended scan. If it says there is an issue with the hard disk, get it replaced.
Any ideas what could be causing this, or if there's a known issue with a particular update that I should roll back? Thanks!
The following day I installed additional windows updates, including some of the 'optional' ones such as 'windows live essentials' and 'windows security essentials'. It is roughly since then that I have been noticing these problems:
Check your CPU temps, and check your memory usage. You can  try running memtest to check you memory to make sure nothing is faulty, but if you weren't having problems before your windows install its probably ok.
