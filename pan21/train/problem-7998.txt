Once connected to remote desktop, drag Citrix window across both monitors.  Press the maximize button, the client will maximize to both screens and be presented as a dual-monitor setup.
I found that as I'm logging in there is a box that has the name of my work computer that in the bottom left corner there is a show options. I click on it and it expands to where I can click on a box that say Use all monitors in a remote session.. It worked for me... Since you previously had 2 screens I assume that the Screen Resolutions already has the box changed to read Extend these Displays.. 
When Citrix is up on one screen -restore it to a window on your desktop. Drag the Citrix window between the two monitors -and Maximise. When the window refreshes, it will be across both screens as desired. 
Good day, all.  Here is a simple solution from the Citrix side.  I created a cmd file with the command "mstsc /span" and shared it as a Citrix application.  It worked when I tried it and I'm have other users test.
