In addition to the books @joeqwerty listed, there are a few mailing lists that have been invaluable to me:
What you were told is correct. Certification is for impressing prospective employers, not for serious learning. In addition to reading books and/or articles you might also consider some of the training videos available. e.g. Those by Laura Chappell are well worth watching.
(Do not use these mailing lists as your personal question-and-answer forum, at least until you've gained some significant experience. Doing so will make the other list participants grumpy. Rather, just subscribe and lurk, reading threads when they seem interesting)
Link: This site is extremely  helpful for all kind of IT training as it has video lectures by Top professional  
The one of best books about networks theory are Olifer N.Olifer V. "Computer Networks" and Tanenbaum A. "Computer Networks".  Sometimes knowing the theory is very useful.
Right Thought!!  Knowledge is more important than certificates. But friend,most companies ask for certificates as Certificates is proof that you have particular knowledge. It's my personal interview experience too..
