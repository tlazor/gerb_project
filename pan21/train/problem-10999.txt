When I run into this problem, I've always used Print Management to get the job done.  A best-kept-secret of the Print Management tool is that you can use Print Management on any computer to install drivers to any other computer for any printer which had been ever previously installed on that print server.  I used this to great advantage at one point to install a "lost-tech" driver for an antique printer from one of our old servers onto the new print server.  Open Print Management on old print server, add new print server to print server list.  Add new printer.
In a similar case today, I'm using one of our x64(a.k.a. x86_64) administration boxes to install x64 drivers onto an x86 box(yeah, you can totally install 64 bit drivers on a 32 bit box, weird, right?), so that another x64 client computer could print to the shared printer.
It looks like the best way to make this work and not ask for the amd64 folder is to set the printer through a x64 bit OS. 
From a 64 bit system (a desktop or something should be fine, same windows generation would be a good idea though), copy the directories at c:\windows\winsxs\amd64_ntprint.inf_* over to your 32 bit system (not into winsxs, though).  The next time a driver install asks for ntprint.inf, point it to the copy in the copied directory.
I had the reverse issue; 32 bit drivers on a 64 bit print server.  This solution may or may not be applicable to your situation, but it's worth a shot:
This stopped the prompts permanently for me, but again, reverse situation; I'm curious to find out if this works!
