Use the native method arraycopy as opposed to manually copying the elements for your concatenation method for better performance: 
The Scanner is only used for retrieving the values at one place (which should be in main()) so you shouldn't make it a static field. Better declare it inside the method.  
One wouldn't expect to see requests for user input inside a method whichs purpose is to initialize an array. The limit and the maximum value should be passed as parameters to this method.  
Also think about making more use of enhanced for loops, how come you are only using them for part of your solution and not the rest?
I totally agree with all of the above, but will add to it that you are prompting the user for an input of the array size, and then not checking it. 
You shouldn't shorten variable or method names. Sam the Maintainer  will thank you for naming your variables and methods with meaningful name where he/she can graps at first glance what is going on.  
Also note that Random.nextInt(max) returns random values between 0 (inclusive) and max (exclusive).
