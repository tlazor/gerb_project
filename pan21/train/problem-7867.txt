Based on your current use, I might suggest reviewing the benefits of a full backup to tape on a Monday (so the tape can still be archived for 3 months, and then permanently stored), and then each day doing an incremental to nearline storage.  Since your M/Tu/Fri tapes are recycled and possibly dont leave the site -- replacing that with nearline disk storage could reduce the complexity considerably.
As I am sure you are aware -- incremental and differential backups are a trade off.  You gain faster overall backups with less data on tape, however restorations are more complex and slower.  Incremental backups have always struck me as "RAID 0 for backups" and I avoid them.  
Based on your bandwidth, recovery requirements, and data change rate -- an online backup solution can be rather appealing.  They typically do a one-time full backup, and then take incremental and compile them such that you can restore from a single point in time and you are none-the-wiser they were pulling incrementals the entire time.
