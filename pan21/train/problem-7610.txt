Me and my friend are both in high school taking a “PLTW” Engineering class, where our goal is to design a solution to any problem and work on that solution over the course of the year. We’re reaching out to this forum in hopes to receive some advice on our startup
If anyone has had experience with assembling people for a project, or just starting a project in general, we would really appreciate any advice you might have for us.
After careful consideration of different projects we could pursue, we came up with the idea of a platform that could provide comp. Sci. students with all the resources they would need to develop their careers. We would take on any willing instructors with backgrounds in coding that would be able to use the students as a means of developing their personal projects, while simultaneously teaching them how to code. Everyone benefits. We hope to expand this past just students, and take on more and more staff. The students would leave the program with experience in their field and proficiency of 1 or more languages.
The main goal of our platform is to provide a network for students and teachers to collaborate and work on projects while developing their skills as coders.
Right now we are in the planning phase. We need to reach out to different communities for not only advice but for reassurance that people would want to take part in this project with us. 
How do we go about finding people that would be willing to invest in our idea? We would need teachers, students, and anyone else who is qualified and willing to work with us.
