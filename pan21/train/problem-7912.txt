The point of direct MP3 editors like mp3dc is that they won't re-encode the file. If you load, split and save in a traditional audio editor such as Audacity, you'll be decompressing and recompressing the data; because MP3 is a lossy format that would inevitably result in degraded audio quality.
It has silence checking in it, as well as other tools to help you split large MP3s into individual tracks.  Here's a link to their Wiki article on the subject.  Plus all you'll need to fix what the 'automatic' things mess up. ;)
There's a whole ton of those out there.  The problem with the 'automatic' ones is that they do 'silence checking' to determine when one song ends and the next begins.
If you have a .cue file that goes with the MP3 describing where the split points are, it'll use that. Otherwise you can pick the points by hand, or use ‘Pause detection’ to guess from where there's silence. (This isn't wholly reliable as there may not be silence between tracks, and there may be silent bits in the middle of a track; check it by manually listening first.)
Since lots of songs have 'silent' parts in them, you usually end up needing to manually check everything at the end anyway.
Having said that, the program I use for all my audio editing needs is Audacity. It's free, open source, and cross platform.
