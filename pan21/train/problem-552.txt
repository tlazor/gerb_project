I thought I'd save money/space by using a single monitor - in most music players I can "downmix to mono" and then shift the balance to full left or right
Does anyone understand why feeding balanced stereo into one speaker results in silence, too? It happens when playing on musicbee as well if I centre the balance
However I cannot downmix Youtube videos and therefore they are currently silent. I cannot use Playback Devices > Levels > Balance because that would just silence one side of the stereo without mixing (it's not a "pan").
Maybe you could use a mono cable? I remember myself using a single earphone plugged into a walkman (yes - a blast from the past) and you should get a physical downmix. Another thing that I have experienced was connecting a samsung stereo headset to a nokia phone which had a different depth of the audio jack and the sound was terrible unless I pulled the plug a bit out so it sent the sound on both channels. A third thing, when I plug something onto the audio jack on my laptop I get a pop up asking me what I have connected (headphones, headset, speaker out,..) so it sure will change the way how the sound will be sent to the jack.
