rsync will maintain file ownership if you run it as root or if the files are owned by you.  It will also maintain the mtime of each individual file.
If the two directories reside on the same filesystem, use mv on the DIRECTORY and not the contents of the directory.
As both directory_old and directory_new are on the same filesystem you could use cp -l instead of mv as an option. cp -l will create a hard links to the original files. When you are done with 'move' and you satisfied with result then you can remove these files from directory_old. in terms of speed it will be same as 'mv' as you first create the links and then you remove the original ones. But this approach let you to start from the beginning if this makes sense
If you have the free space, archive them into a single .tar file (with no compression is faster) and then move that file over and unarchive it.
Notice the trailing / on the source.  This means it will copy the CONTENTS of the directory and not the directory itself.  If you leave the / off, it will still copy the files but they will sit in a directory named /destination/directory.  With the /, the files will just be in /destination
