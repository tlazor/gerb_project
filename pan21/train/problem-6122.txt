There's nothing wrong with monitoring the server every second, it's just not very efficient especially on servers with high load where an Apache query may hang for a couple of seconds causing your requests to either backup, or issue false alerts for that particular moment, but it's not 'wrong'. One second checks won't make you any faster at responding, and in 99.9% of all circumstances, a 10 or 30 second check is just as important. 
I agree 100% with Joseph here. If you still want to do some sort of real-time monitoring you could consider sniffing the webserver log for both server errors and absence of new entries in the log for a period of time. It won't put a load on the server, but triggering alerts based on this is a challenge :)
Nagios or munin can probably handle running the test every second but it's a bit obsessive. Is there a reason you need to check so frequently? If your server is that unstable you probably have deeper problems.
Most commercial monitoring software offer 1-min or 5-min interval by default. That seems to be a good check interval.
