I up-voted for Google Calendar + CalDAV as I use that for my personal calendars and it works well for me, but I don't use To Dos/Tasks at all so I don't miss that functionality.
We use it as our calendar for our business, and it's solid. iCal integration is not 100% (no tasks, each calendar is a new account), but the most important parts are even better than iCal Server IMO. Having google email or SMS you a few hours before a meeting is especially nice.
One other suggestion is BusyMac's BusySync. Shareware and does a great job of sharing & syncing calendars on a local network.
I wouldn't suggest using Mac OS X Server's iCal Server (also CalDAV-powered) anyway as there are still a few odd bugs w/group calendars, permissions, re-sycing when disconnected, etc. Also, it really requires an Open Directory setup with the workstations bound and don't expect to be able to invite anyone to meetings if they aren't in Open Directory. Overall  it's okay, but probably more work than you're looking for.
Check out Zimbra Open Source Edition.  It supports CalDAV for Leopard clients as well as address book Sync.  You won't need to setup a dedicated server since it supports Mac OSX as a server platform or you could run it under a Linux virtual machine with VirtualBox/VMWare Fusion/Parallels and make it portable.
