When I ask to change nameservers for my domain, and I change it to, say "srv01.kaareskovgaard.net" for my DNS - how is this going to be translated into an IP - when the record for this is on the exact same DNS server?
Next when you go to your registrar and change your nameservers, you will enter srv01.kaareskovgaard.net, because the nameserver is on the same domain, you will then be asked to enter the IP of the nameserver.
I suspect there's some reverse DNS going on here, but how does this work, and is there anything I need to do to make this work, and most importantly, is this possible at all?
When you specify the new DNS servers, you'll have to specify both a name AND the corresponding IP, if the name of the server is a record of the domain it is going to serve.
I have for a long time had my own "play-around" domain kaareskovgaard.net where I've had a minor blog running. I recently decided that I wanted to try to run my own server on it, and so I ordered a VPS for it. I have managed to relocate my site to the new server now, setting appropriate DNS records with my old providers DNS. However I would like to move the DNS to my server. I HAVE installed a DNS server on the VPS and tested that it works as it should (using nslookup and specifying which server to use).
Also, if you're going to host your own DNS you should look at who's going to provide secondary DNS in case yours goes down. Some hosting providers offer this service.
To do this, you firstly need to have NameServer records setup on your own DNS server for srv01.kaareskovgaard.net. You would also usually have 2 name server records, your registrar may require this, so you may want to setup srv02.kaareskovgaard.net as well, this should preferably point to a different IP to the first one. It can point to the same DNS server, although best practice is to have a second backup DNS server for your sendon nameserver, but obviously if this is a hobby then its not neccasery.
