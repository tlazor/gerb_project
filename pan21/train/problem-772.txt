Once yo get into your PC open system Configuration from admin tools/ click on boot and put whichever system you want as your main boot first and set it as default. That way it will always start when you don't press F8. The windows 10 boot manager is horrible and if you use it and chose windows 7 to boot it will shut down the PC an restart in windows 7. It is so slow.
Soon as the PC begins to start press F8 which will bring up a bios boot menu with each hdd listed. Just choose the one you want to boot into.
You can install it on the second drive without disconnecting the first, you just have to be careful to select the proper drive to install W7 on during setup.
When you boot from the windows 7 disc installation it will see both drives just choose your ssd drive to install it on there. You can only install one Os at a time you can have both going at once cause technically it's one computer if it's a separate computer sure why not.
When it is all done connect up your original hdd & restart (switch off the PC or press reset button).
it's best to take out the first drive and install windows on the second drive. this will allow your new installation to not see the original one. Also when writing the boot files, you'll have overwritten your original installation's system reserved area. What this will do for you is allow you to pull up your boot menu (from the bios) and select which hard drive you wish to boot from. This, imo, is the preferred way to do such a thing in case you're looking to revert back or format the second drive. This way you have not affected your primary drive at all. Note. some computers have different key strokes for your bios boot menu.
You may have to press a different button to F8 but my motherboard is an asus so that is what I press.
Disconnect your first hdd the one you are using now. Now connect your second hdd and install you other version of windows onto it.
