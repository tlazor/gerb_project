Right. So by the recommendation of my local IT guy, I found out it was a corrupted account, and did the following:
Once you have backed the data up. Try downloading Crystal Disk Info and run it on the drive. If it shows up healthy then I would re-install windows. If however it shows up anything other than a healthy drive I would acquire a new HDD and install windows on to that.
I faced the same issue.  Nothing to worry.  Just boot into safe mode(in case of win 8/8.1 press and hold shift and perform a restart. You will be booted into advanced menu select troubleshoot in submenu select adavced start option and select restart after restart press 5, you will be booted into safemode)  there your computer will back to previous good config and perform normal restart. Everything works fine thereafter. 
If I was doing this proper, I should have had reinstalled the whole thing, but I really wasn't in the position to do that, as I needed the lappy in a hurry.
Backup your Users folder to an external device/share before you do anything else. If it is in fact your hard drive failing, you will want to utilise as much time recovering any data as it could die at any time.
