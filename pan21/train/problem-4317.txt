As every DNS based solution, there's always time to live TTL involved: it will take TTL seconds for every change to take effect for alreay cached queries. According to the FAQ you must keep this in mind as you need to decide the most suitable TTL by yourself.
The article of Choosing a Routing Policy gives you the best overview. The failover is DNS based, but the load balancing is not necessarily based on a simple round robin that would give all possible A records to anyone; it can be configured to give different servers based on region etc. as well as it can be configured to monitor for unhealthy servers and drop them from responses.
looking at route53 and its health check service and auto Failover feature I cant understand if all its really doing is just auto manage the dns record for me so when a node is down its just getting out of the dns records and getting back when its up or its uses some magic?
if its the first cast(normal dns records) then if some client cache the dns records of my website than even on failure he could still be directed into my failed nodes?
so I am looking for load balancing service for simple php cluster servers that hosted outside of aws
