If I remember my modem days properly (and they've been easy to forget), I think that at this point all you might need is a good init string for your modem. You should look into how to configure the dialer software that you're using.
That may not be an option if your computer does not have a free serial port, but if it does, it's probably the easiest solution.
If you can communicate with the modem then chances are that you already have the driver loaded. I'm not clear on the above - do you have values after each of the AT commands you listed?
Hm, that is one of those infamous softmodems. As far as I can tell, you have a LSI/Agere MDC Softmodem. There are no official Linux drivers for these. There are some drivers available, but as they need to hook into the Linux kernel, they can be tricky to install. See e.g. http://www.modemsite.com/56K/lucentamr.asp for details.
A pragmatic workaround would be to just buy a regular modem. A good old analog modem sells on Ebay or similar for around 10 $ (used). If it uses a serial (RS-232) connection, there will be minimal headache. USB modems can also work, but many need a special driver, so google Linux compatibility before buying.
