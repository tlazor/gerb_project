I've got a DHCP role running on a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine.  The scope is set in the proper IPv4 subnet.  When I select "Add/Remove Bindings..." I see both the NIC with the configured static IP and the Internal virtual switch defined in Hyper-V Manager.
I want to provide DHCP to VMs via the Virtual Switch, and recognize that an "External" switch changes the configuration of the physical NIC so I've set up an "Internal" (not Private) switch.  I also want to provide DHCP to a physical client connected via a properly configured Cisco 3750X.
The NIC that I'm trying to serve DHCP on happens to be the same one I use to remotely manage the server via RDP.  I don't think this should affect anything as my laptop NIC is statically configured as well as the server NIC, both of which are outside the scope of the DHCP server but within the same subnet.
The end game is to be able to deploy Windows 10 via PXE to both VMs locally on the server using Hyper-V (and WDS) and remotely to clients on the network, but first I need DHCP working properly and this seems like a very basic problem.
When I try to bind the DHCP server to either or both of these interfaces, I can check the box next to them but the "Apply" button never highlights and if I click "Ok", nothing changes.  Every time I go back to that window the boxes are unchecked.
You'll need to modify the settings of WDS to not use port 67, which can be accomplished with this command:
