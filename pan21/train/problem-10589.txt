The previous paragraph contains the important questions, but I have a few more that I must explain my motivation towards. I am interested in the programming of botting. Ethical botting - I don't plan on actually abusing the automation to run 24/7. I just find it to be a great programming challenge to glean information from a game, and then make decisions from that information. I am stuck in the starting gate. The unofficial questions from this post would be: How can I make a bot (language, tools, libraries)? Can I get information through the communication between client and server, rather than the brute force pixel detection easily used in more static games?
Diablo 3 cooperates with Blizzard servers even during single player games. In fact, Blizzard has had problems with the games "melting their servers." 
I would like to ask: How do the client and the server communicate? What details does the client leave to the server, and vice versa? What details are redundant - both the client and the server know - and how often do they disagree?
There probably is a trust issue, and to that all I can say is that I promise not to abuse the answers. But please feel free to answer any of the questions you feel comfortable with. Thank you!
