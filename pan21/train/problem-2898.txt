If speed and reliability is important, RAID0+1 should give the best performance (no parity to calculate) with up to two drive failure survivability. But not all controllers supports it.
RAID5 uses ONLY ONE parity drive per stripe and many RAID5 arrays are 5 (if your counts are different adjust the calculations
If it's a complex database-driven website then I'd still just have a RAID 1 pair for the OS (which is what you actually asked about), but have a different disk configuration for the data(base).
I operate a Datacenter and am the CTO for a good sized hosting operation.  WE STRONGLY URGE FOLKS NEVER TO USE RAID 5.   
It depends! If it's a simple, static website then a pair of RAID 1 disks should be fine, as presumably the disk contents would end up cached in RAM anyway.
Now, as hard drives get bigger, RAID 5 really becomes less ideal, as your likelihood of hitting a URE during a single-drive rebuild is pretty high. 
I work for a major hosting company, and the most common thing I see in my enterprise segment (not necessarily that I recommend, but what I see), assuming that the server is standalone / using local storage, is a RAID 1 OS array, and a RAID5 data array.  
But since you seem to be specifically asking about the OS drive, yes, RAID 1 is standard and usually sufficient, unless you're going to be running other apps off that drive.
The RAID 5 READ-WRITE-PENALTY: Now when a disk block is read from the array the RAID software/firmware
RAID 5 IS WASTEFUL BUT SO IS RAID 10 and 1:  If you have 10 drives or say 20GB each for 200GB RAID5 will use 20% for parity
