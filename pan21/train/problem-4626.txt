But what I can not figure out is why my browsers (Firefox, Safari, Opera) can not resolve the domain. I am on a Wifi connection. What could be the problem?
I have had the exact same problem, where a number of websites would allow me to traceroute, but I could not access them or ping them (receiving the same icmp_seq timeout error).
I am trying to figure out an issue. My internet is working fine, but this one website is not resolving. It works via a proxy, traceroute works:
Ask them if they are running mod_security - perhaps your IP is on a list of spammers.  This can happen by accident if you're testing code that sends email from your own system in an invalid way.
The issue turned out to be my home router (Netgear DG834G) and a simple restart now and again fixes the problem. However I am none the wiser as to why this is happening, assuming its just a bug in the software, as it is usually after roughly the same uptime.
If you cannot resolve the domain, the problem is most likely with your DNS servers and not the site.
