In Windows' Regional and Language Options control panel dialog box on the Languages tab, you can choose different keyboards. On my Win XP system there are two choices for German, plain German and German (IBM). The latter might have the QWERTY layout you want.
On Windows it is really simple. Just install Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, load the existing keyboard you want to modify, then make the changes you want and produce a new keyboard layout.
What I usually do is to customise keyboard layouts to my liking: adding characters I use frequently for example.
It's a (yet another ;) "programmer's layout" (same idea as for Polish/Czech Programmer's Keyboard) created by me in M$ Keyboard Layout Creator that allows typing umlauts by AltGr + appropriate Latin letter key combinations (+ some useful symbols as extras). Just share it with community, enjoy :)
If you don't have the icon / short cut you can find it (on windows 7) searching for "Language" or "Region" in the application menu thingy formerly known as start menu.
You should have a little DE or EN in the lower right corner, where the volumne indicator and various other status icons are. Click on it, and you'll see a menue to choose between the configured language settings.
