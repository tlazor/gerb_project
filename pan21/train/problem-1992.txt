So I'll probably make a decision based on this simple criteria: which distro out of the two makes it easiest for installing the latest versions of Ruby and Postgres?
I am getting a new server as I've messed up my current box, while trying to install Postgres 9 (on my CentOS 5.8 box). To cut a long story short, I removed postgres but yum decided to remove virtualmin-base as well, which broke my virtualmin install (postfix/dovcot stopped working). Virtualmin advise a fresh install once virtualmin-base has been removed/reinstalled.
I know you can pull in a later version of Ruby from the Debian Testing/Unstable using pinning (YMMV - risky).
They are both equally respected as web servers, so I really don't mind either way - I just want to use the one that will work best with the software I need.
Well, from what I know, it might be easier for Debian, because you can try hooking into repositories made for Ubuntu and its forks.
Ruby applications are usually dependent on a specific ruby version, so you better find out what ruby version you need and then take a look at what versions are in the standard repositories.
My experiences with CentOS so far were rather horrible (of the "just compile custom locally already" variety).
Ruby can be very picky. If the distro supports the ruby version you need then go for it. Having said that I use Centos with a self compiled version of Ruby and some Gems that didn't come with the repository.
