Your last question about location of the central location can be answered often by the cable company, especially if service has been provided to your residence in the past. It is usually in an attic over a garage or a sheltered location on the outside, called a demark.
There are devices known as ethernet to coax adapters, many of which are pricey, especially if you are considering to use "a bunch of computers" but may be the least expensive method to use existing wiring.
Examine closely the requirements for these devices, as well as the features offered among the wide variety of products on the market. Newer wiring will be of the form of RG-6, a larger diameter and higher capacity than older RG-59 and is preferred over the older, less capable RG-59 wiring.
In the case of the coax adapters, the central location would become the resource for your router as well.
If your house is wired in what is known as "home-run" format, each outlet in the rooms will run to a central location, allowing you to use a multi-port ethernet-to-coax device. It is unusual to have a residence wired otherwise.
Your second question regarding connectivity overlooks an important aspect of any wiring. There is an outlet in a room. It goes somewhere else. That location has to be connected "somehow" to a resource, typically a router.
Connector installation should be done with proper tools to maintain coaxial cable transmission characteristics. Crushing a connector with pliers is contra-indicated.
