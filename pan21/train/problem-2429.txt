There's a nice solution hostapd which implements Inter Access Point Protocol (IAPP). That will allow you to roam from one access point to another seamlessly. If you can arrange overlapping coverage of APs it'll appear to be one big hotspot. There's a nice introductory article covering it.
wireless client will roam from one AP to the other when it looses the connectivity, but don't expect ultra smooth handover.
it'd be much better if you have wired backbone linking all access points together, but if you cannot have it - most APs support wireless distribution system.
typically it will be enough if your access points have the same ssid and the same type / password for authentication and different wireless channels. 
I manage the network for my parents small business (an after hours type thing just to keep them from having to pay someone), and I would like to setup a wireless network for them. They have two large warehouse type buildings with a small private "road" in between. I would like them to be able to have wireless access anywhere in or around these buildings... how is this accomplished? I know I'll need a few access points, but how do you bring it all together so that you have "one" large wireless network?
Also, if they add another location somewhere, is there anything that can be done to have a wireless network there that "matches" the one at the first location? Basically so Windows would recognize it all as the same network and know to connect when in range of either?
