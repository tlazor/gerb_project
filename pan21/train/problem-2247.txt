If the Server 2K3R2 server fails and you do re-build it, you shouldn't have to get anything from backups as far as the Active Directory is concerned.  If all the FSMO roles are on the 2K8R2 server, as well as it being a GC, when you re-build the 2K3R2 server, make it a domain controller and let it get all the replicated information from the 2K8R2 server.  If your DNS is Active Directory-Integrated, all that will replicate as well as accounts, GPOs, etc... If you try to pull something from backup, even if it was from the night before, the server that's up and running may have newer information on it and you wouldn't want it to replicate old AD information.
The only thing you might have to get from a backup is if it's got other roles, like a DHCP server, scheduled scripts, or something else in the mix that's not also running on the 2K8R2 server.
You'd definitely want to get another DC going and if you can replace it with newer hardware that can run Server 2K8R2, then there ya go.  You always want a 2nd DC.
