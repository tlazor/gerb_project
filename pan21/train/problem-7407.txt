And if you're really desperate to find out if your hardware is definatly still ok. Reformat and reinstall your OS after backing up your important data to an external harddrive or dvd(s). That's what I always do when my machine gets all cranky.
It could be a heat problem; the HDD activity could just be correlated to general activity. Modern CPUs will throttle the clock rate hugely and hardly accomplish anything if they are overheating to help protect the chip from being destroyed. It may not manifest as high CPU usage in task manager.
Check BIOS to see if there is temperature monitoring in there. Pull gently on the heatsink to see if it is on tight. You may want to pull it off, clean both surfaces and reapply thermal paste if you don't see the problem elsewhere.
If the heatsink was knocked loose, the CPU could be heating up enough to cause this even in the early boot up stages. If thermal transfer isn't happening, the CPU could be getting REALLY hot while the sink stays cool.
For starters, you are seeing a spike of HDD usage in PerfMon, which coincides with the slowdown, secondly a 20 minute startup time is obscene, even for much older hardware, and is a behaviour I've seen on countless computers with bad hard drives.
I would suggest finding the manufacturer of the hard drive specifically, then obtaining the appropriate free diagnostic tool from that manufacturer's website.  Examples of this would be Seagate's SeaTools (Which is available at http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/)
Run a "quick" diagnostic if it has such an option, and if the quick diagnostic does not turn anything up, you will want to run a full surface scan, which can take a very long time depending on the size/speed of the drive.
I hate to say it, but from a number of years doing repairs I would tend to lean towards the hard drive, though this of course is far from a guarantee.
