It's definitely do-able. To have your RPi act as a router - assign IP addresses with DHCP to a LAN and use a WiFi signal as an uplink to an internet connection - you can try following this guide, slightly modifying it to suit your own needs with the 3G dongle rather than another WiFi network.
You can forgive the "ethernet-ready-tv" part. Rather than directly connecting your ethernet cable to a tv, you can just as well connect it to a hub and will work just the same with multiple nodes.
I have a Raspberry Pi model B, a USB 3G dongle (ZTE MF667) and a Netgear WG602v3 access point. I'm wondering if it's possible to set up Raspberry Pi as a router that connects to the internet through the 3G dongle, and then use a network cable to connect it to Netgear WG602 and use the Netgear as a wireless access point for other devices?
I've found a ton of guides that describe using Raspberry Pi as a wireless access point, but I didn't find anything about using a separate device as an acess point, and just using the Pi as a router. Is it doable in any way?
