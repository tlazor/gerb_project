There are a few requirements that must be met to enable Hyper-V on Windows 8. According to this TechNet article, other than SLAT, you must also have 4GB of RAM and the system must be 64-bit. These requirements are listed on the Client Hyper-V page on TechNet.  
Having just experienced this issue myself today, I think the trick is to restart the computer and not shut down. I had done a few cold reboots with no success and went to disable the fast-boot option where I read the following:
More information about Hyper-V and other new features in Windows 8 can be found on the Explore page of the Springboard Series on TechNet.
These will have either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ next to them, which should help you to track down the exact issue that is stopping you from enabling Hyper-V on your system.
The checkbox to install Hyper-V in Windows 8 Pro is disabled.  Hovering over it reveals the message, Hyper-V cannot be installed: Virtualization support is disabled in the firmware.  There is a virtualization option in the UEFI settings that was previously disabled, but I enabled it, and then did a cold boot.  My processor seems to support the necessary virtualization features, according to the Intel website (VT-x and SLAT).  Do I have any chance of getting around this?
There is a simple check that you can also run to verify that your system meets the requirements. Open a command prompt and type ‘systeminfo.exe’ (without the quotes) and hit enter. The last section will show four lines:
I then proceeded to restart the computer instead of shutdown and hey presto, it worked! This could be be coincidence but I think it's likely that fast startup is disabled in the event of a restart.
