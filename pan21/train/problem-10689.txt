What serious drawbacks have you heard of?  The primary problem with virtualizing Windows 2000 is the fact that W2K doesn't support VSS, which means you can't do an online P2V... you have to shut it down to virtualize the server.  This is an OS limitation and not a virtualization platform limit though, and applies to both Hyper-V and VMWare.
Overall I've been happy with hyper-v server. We ended up going with it because I like the path that it was heading on the free side over what vmware was doing for free. Both are good platforms but for people like me that are primarily windows shops and have a very very small virtualization budget it's great.
We took a old p3 Xeon physical machine and virtualized it to hyper-v server and it worked great. Itâ€™s much faster than the old hardware it was on. That being said it was a low use machine we kept around for a few legacy apps (asp web apps and sql 2000), but you could tell a definite speed increase over the old machine. It did go to a dell poweredge 2950 box that had 8 cores and 12 gig of ram, so I'm sure that's part of it too.
