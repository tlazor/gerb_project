I run daily backups with Bacula since a couple of days and I was wondering if I can do this kind of thing.
I've already specified the UseVolumeOnce = yes directive in the configuration files, but now I want to know if I can make Bacula move the tape to slot 24 (I/O slot) when the job finishes.
Can bacula do this or do I need to script it? If I need to script it, do you have experience with that?
Take a look at the "Run Before Job" and "Run After Job" 'Job' parameters to call your the script you've written.   We've tended to favor calling a script that runs a command into bconsole (through input redirection) to unmount your tape volume, and then call MTX to move the tape around.
Without having the same environment to test with, I'm not certain this will work, but a script like this called via the RunAfterJob directive in bacula-dir.conf should work:
You do have to script it, but the combination of Bacula and a recent version of MTX makes this not too painful.
If you want to avoid calling external scripts, you might experiment with the AlwaysOpen, RequiresMount/MountCommand/UnmountCommand, and/or OfflineOnUnmount directives. All of these are in the Device resource of your Storage Daemon configuration.
I have set up an admin job called Eject that runs the following script at priority 1000, so it is executed once all of the backups are finished:
Also, can you clarify why this is desirable for you? Perhaps there's a solution to the root problem we're overlooking.
