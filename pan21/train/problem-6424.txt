The current production version of Samba (3.5) allows Samba computers to join Windows domains, but does not support native Active Directory/Group Policy replication.  The long-upcoming Samba version 4.0 is gradually being merged into each release and will allow a Samba server to act as a full-on domain controller at the Windows Server 2003 functional level, including Active Directory and Group Policy replication.
Samba is an open source implementation of the CIFS/SMB protocol used by Microsoft in Windows networking, meaning your Samba server can share file and print services with Windows/Mac/*nix clients that have software conforming to the CIFS/SMB protocol.  It can also act as a client to connect to other Windows/Samba systems hosting CIFS/SMB shares and printers.  Windows, Mac, and *nix clients can have both the server that allows them to share files and printers, and a client that can use this protocol to connect to shares on other computers.  Having a Samba server on your network won't affect your other clients' ability to share files on their own computers one way or another, but these clients can be configured to connect to shares on the samba server.
