My prior experience suggests that you wouldn't expect to see a noticible hit in performance for a lightly-loaded server computer's other duties if it were processing small, bursty routing traffic. YMMV, though, and you should test it out and see.
The nicest thing about using a dedicated device is that you don't lose  your intra-VLAN routing because of regular maintenance events like server computer patches / reboots. A sufficiently stripped-down Linux or OpenBSD installation running no unnecessary services will need very little in the way of regular patching and rebooting (not unlike most purpose-built embedded devices), and you can use less volatile storage technologies than hard disk drives, like boot from flash or optical media.
Rather than relying on any off-the-shelf benchmarks I'd do some in-house testing with the types and quantities of traffic that you expect to be moving around. Particularly on a shared server / router scenario, the character of your particular server computer's existing workload and NIC drivers are going to play a big role in performance.
