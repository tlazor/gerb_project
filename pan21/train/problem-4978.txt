Just use ProcMon (Process Monitor) to examine the events. Filter by explorer.exe and then category network. A quote from Mark Russinovich:
When troubleshooting a hang with Process Monitor, you should first see if there are any gaps in operation time stamps that match the hang duration. You can look for lengthy operations by adding the Duration column to the display and then making sure to filter out operations that commonly don’t immediately complete, like directory change notifications. That can be useful when you don’t see a significant time gap between operations because the process has multiple threads, some of which continue to operate while the one causing the hang is dormant.
Are you running any sort of anti-virus?  I find that McaFee, for example, will cause the machine to exhibit exactly those symptoms - freezing, annoying pauses, but little or no CPU usage.  You can try pausing the process, but that may make the entire systems freeze if you suspend the wrong thing.
Also check for disk errors, take a look at http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/ to see if there are problems with the disk itself.
