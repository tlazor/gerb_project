It seems obvious to me that User DSNs should carried along with a roaming User's Profiles, and when only a System DSN is set, that it will not be pulled along with the User's profile when they hop from work station to workstation.  
Having said that, if you throw out a Google search on User DSNs and roaming profiles, you'll get a whole bunch of results back for how to troubleshoot it not working, which should inform you about the wisdom of relying on roaming profiles to actually work reliably.
However, I don't know this for a fact, although it makes sense in my head. Is that the case, does have to be a particular kind of profile for this to occur?
In the instances that roaming profiles actually function as intended/expected, this is what happens, yes.  User DSNs move with the users (providing the machine they move to have the requisite driver installed), System DSNs stay with whatever system they're on.  Of course, if the same System DSN is on multiple machines, it will still be there for a roaming user, but because it was there to begin with, not because it moved.
Yes, a user DSN roams with the user profile. The user DSN is stored in the HKCU registry hive for the user.
User DSNs should roam however, as you can create User DSNs using the user-specific portion of the registry
