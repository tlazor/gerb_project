You can. User Online Tools like URL Fuzzer. There are also a few download managers that will browse web directories for you.
(In some configurations (for example, DirectorySlash off in Apache2), http://example.com/path/ displays the index page while http://example.com/path returns the index, but this is very rare.)
In the standard configuration of all popular web servers, the term "allows browsing" only applies when the directory in question does not have a default page, to avoid introducing a large security hole.
The browser used does not matter; all they do is send a HTTP request and display returned data. It's entirely up to the server whether to display the index or the default page.
Sometimes you can browse a directory that has a default or index file. The only way I have found to do so is to find a sub directory on the site that lacks a default or index file and then traverse from there. For instance say you're on an image site you might get a listing by clicking on an image and then removing the image file name from the url and pressing enter. Of course this won't work if listing is disabled.
