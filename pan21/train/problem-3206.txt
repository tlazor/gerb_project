I want to know of a middle ground between encryption and basic folder hiding. It should be more of a deterrent than an actual encryption. Enough so that the person who connected the drive to his/her computer must not be able to get access to it by clicking a few buttons in the OS environment. 
I have a transcend 1 TB HDD that has some sensitive data in it. I want no one to be able to access that drive. I know that there's an option to encrypt the whole drive but I think it will be ridiculous to actually encrypt 1TB of data. 
Consider using True Crypt.  You will be able to create an encrypted container and map it as a drive letter.
Install 7-zip and put the data you want to protect in a password-protected .7z file.  Name the file something innocuous like crashlogs.7z or similar. This will probably be the least work and the quickest thing to do if you only have a few hundred MB of sensitive data or so, and your data will be really encrypted.
You'll need to right click the folder and go to the Security tab.  You'll need to uncheck the box that says "Inherit permissions from parent" or similar, and then add a permission entry that only has your user account (don't even add Administrator) and set yourself as the owner.  Don't mess with deny permissions - users that don't show up on the list can't access and deny will have side effects you don't want.
You could change the permissions on the file to only allow you to read and write. Do this on the top-level folder containing the data so you can tell the permissions to be inheritable from it. 
Any account on any Windows system with admin permissions can take ownership and reset the permissions, but as you'll find out by doing the above, it's not terribly obvious IMHO to a casual non-technical user to do that.  If they know a competent IT person though, such a person could find out in a manner of minutes or so how to undo it.
