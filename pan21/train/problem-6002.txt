In other words: for recent Windows installations, the answer is for all intents and purposes "no". For older Windows installations, yes:
For obvious security reasons, Windows has been disabling that sort of functionality in their latest systems (7 and above) for USB drives. This because hackers developed a technique of dropping infected USB sticks in all sorts of common rooms, hoping that someone would plug them into their machines trying to see who the owner was. The hacker then hoped that the unsuspecting user would allow the autorun to proceed, which would then be totally free to do its infection work.
There are specialized flash drives that present themselves as CD-Rom drives. Like the U3 drives in the article I linked to. Though I believe they haven't been made in years. Autoplay is still enabled by default for CD-rom drives.
There are ways to enable autorun on windows 7 and above machines (here for instance), but of course this needs to be done manually beforehand by anyone who wants to actively breach their security in this way (or by a network sysadmin for a company network, though I imagine very few people would actively poke an unnecessary hole in their security like that).
So yeah... It may be possible do accomplish your tasks, but a better solution would be to just staple the USB sticks to your brother so he doesn't lose them.
NOTE! This is something no-one should want to do, no matter how good the intentions! One would be actively offending people's privacy and security BIGTIME by sending their ip/machine info to somewhere else. IF anyone would want to do this, said one should make sure to inform the user who inserted the drive about what you are going to "send home" and give them ample opportunity to opt out.
My little brother often losses his USB keys. Is there a way/program/batch file that can push notifications to my email containing the host's information?
