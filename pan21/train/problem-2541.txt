A ticket linked to SERVER-14139 covers an implementation in the enterprise (non-free) version of MongoDB of a storage watchdog timer. Organizations that can instead use the watchdog daemon or an external monitoring process should prefer that approach, because it can protect against more kinds of resource failure.
The commentary in discuss a monitoring approach that kills either the process or shuts down the operating system and can be done using a cron job or the watchdog daemon. Because a mongod process cannot win an election before it has read and written some data to its storage engine, it is safe to immediately attempt to restart mongod after you kill it. The restarted process should not accept connections and certainly will not be able to win an election for primary.
A closely related question is discussed extensively in the comments on SERVER-14139, a bug report against filed against mongodb. To summarize, it is not feasible to build a fully general hang detection system inside a server process.
