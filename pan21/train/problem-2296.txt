The first thing I tried was to replace all files that had a backed-up copy by the plugin. However, this didn't help. I hope this wasn't a mistake since I have a copy of all files and the DB immediately after the failed upgrade.
The next thing that comes to my mind is to delete all files from the server, do a fresh install of the latest Wordpress and then try to somehow gradually restore the plugins, themes, and content from the backup files I have.
I have a Wordpress blog that is hosted on a Windows server. I have been using the Wordpress Automatic Upgrade plugin for over a year now without any problems. However, the last time I decided to update to the latest version of Wordpress, things went terribly wrong. At some point the upgrade process ended with a bunch of PHP error messages and my blog was no longer accessible. After googling for some time I found out that the upgrade plugin does not work with the latest version of Wordpress. So, my question is what is the best way to restore my blog to its state before the upgrade?
I backed up all files on the server immediately after the failed upgrade and exported the MySQL database that was used by the blog. I also noticed that the upgrade plugin had backed up some files before the upgrade.
Does anyone know if there is a better way to restore a f*****-up Wordpress installation? Is there a standard procedure in similar cases? Has anyone had the same problem with the automatic upgrade plugin?
