You might then be able to tell that there is a GUI based on lxde installed together with a lightdm display manager that is sporting the pi-greeter running on X11, but possibly no more than that.
If you want to do know if Pixel might be installed from without using apt, you could search for packages listed in /var/lib/apt/extended_states that match such a system.
Keep in mind though that in linux many different combinations of packages might achieve the same thing, meaning that you might under some circumstances face a situation where somebody runs just some parts of some common combination like, lets say, Pixel.
There are much more clues to be found though, and with some digging on what components Pixel consists of (or uses by default, like lightdm) you could also find out which folders/files, init scripts and configuration files are needed for those components to run. Ultimately, you could then conclude from their (non-) existence in the filesystem if Pixel is installed.
This might already give you a good start and might even be enough for most situations as most people won't install a boot splash screen and an icon set specifically designed and branded for a desktop environment they don't have installed. Just my two cents.
One possible way would be to check if the raspberrypi-ui-mods package is installed, which should give a good clue on whether the Pi has Pixel installed. This is possible by running for example apt list raspberrypi-ui-mods --installed. This lists the version of the package if it is installed.
