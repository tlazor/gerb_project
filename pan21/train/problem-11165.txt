For example, if you have Windows 10 Version 1607, you cannot install cumulative update of Windows 10 Version 1703 on your machine. Because each cumulative updates performs testing on different Windows 10 build. (Reference: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000825/windows-10-windows-server-2016-update-history)
By the way, Microsoft strongly recommended to get latest build via Windows Update to make sure that your PC is ready for latest build of Windows 10. (Reference: https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/04/25/windows-10-creators-update-rollout-first-phase-update/#m80vsR6j9gibgtRM.97)
If you want to update any Windows 10 machine to latest build (Offline Update). (For example, your Windows 10 machine is version 1607 and you want to get latest build of Windows 10 (current stable version is 1703). You can get installation files or ISO file on Microsoft Software Download website. (Go to Microsoft.com then search for "Download Windows 10")  But, you must check with your computer manufacturer website that your machine supports latest build before update it. If your computer does not support latest build, it will become unstable.
