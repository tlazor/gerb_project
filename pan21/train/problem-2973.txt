However if the players origin is at, for example, 0,0 and I click at 10,300 then it travels right and up but when the spell reaches an x of 10 it travels directly upwards. I want the spell to travel at an angle that it will reach the x coordinate at the same time as the y coordinate. Here is an image showing what happens and what I want to happen.
The behavior you're currently having is caused by adding to the y and x position step by step until either or both have reached the same x and/or y position of the target. You add one unit to x and y causing a sloped movement not aimed at the target until you hit either the y or x axis the target lies on.
Normalize the resulting vector since we don't care about the length of the vector, just the direction it's pointing towards. We can add the x and y of this normalized vector to current position to reach our target. (To normalize we divide the vector by its length)
I am trying to get my player to shoot a spell and it travels to where ever the player clicked. I can easily accomplish this by doing the following.
