Some USB devices are made up of several subdevices. Your keyboard is likely one of them. This is perfectly normal.
Daniel B's answer is probably correct (your keyboard is acting as multiple devices). The reason why keyboards will do that is because the designers of USB decided that a USB keyboard should only be able to send 6 simultaneous regular keys + 4 modifier keys (shift, control, etc):
1:  Make sure it has the latest drivers installed, there are drivers and programs listed for download in your link.  I bet those would fix the problem.
3:  Obviously a bit extreme, but a re-install of the system would definitely help narrow down or fix the problem.  (It's very easy to re-install in some cases, not sure if your situation is one of them)
2:  I would try a different USB bus.  Usually the front USB and back USB ports on most desktops are on different chips, perhaps trying the other chip might "reset" it or something.
To illustrate, here's a screenshot of my configuration, consisting of one keyboard and one mouse (Logitech G700):
