In your program, set up print settings for high resolution (in InDesign, this is on the "Advanced" print tab) and for PDF printer preferences, uncheck "rely on system fonts", select the PDF page size, and select "Press Quality."
In my case, the preflight tool determined there were no PDF/X-1a errors in my file. (YAY!) I have read on other threads (such as QBN) that there is a glitch in InDesign that can occur with bleed/trim when creating PDF/X-1a. 
I found more hints about the preflight tool here: https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/11/using/correcting-problem-areas-preflight-tool.html
In Acrobat Pro, open the "Press Quality" PDF you just created, then open the preflight tool. (In Acrobat Pro XI (CS5), this is under Advanced > Print Production > Preflight.) Click and expand the PDF/X compliance tab. Choose Convert to PDF/X-1a (SWOP) unless you know for sure you need one of the other settings. Select "Analyze and Fix." You can save your final "fixedup" PDF/X-1a:2001 PDF as whatever name you choose and it will create the file.
Kurt's trick worked wonders for me! (Thank you!!!) I have been a graphic designer for almost 16 years and I have come across my fair share of PDF/X-1a bleedbox and trimbox errors when I can find no logical reason for them. This is the FIRST true fix I have found after years of searching! My steps were slightly different than Kurt's, so I will share:
