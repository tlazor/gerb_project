Most of the time, no.  You must backup the RAID-1, destroy the RAID-1, rebuild as RAID-5, then restore.
My guess however, is that this is your home media server, because if it were a publicly available server that needed to be very reliable, then you would care about things like a hardware RAID controller. Software RAID isn't anywhere near as reliable, and RAID cards these days are not expensive. (ref: Highpoint RocketRAID) Even if this were a NFS or SMB share on an office network, there would be no problem backing up the data to another computer, nuking the array, and rebuilding it as whatever you want.
Is it possible to upgrade from a software RAID-1 to a RAID-5 under Windows 2k3 Server? My Google searches didn't really turn up anything definitive here.
I'm also assuming that you have a hot spare in the first place, since you would need a minimum of 3 disks for RAID 5. 9 times out of 10 however, it's totally worth whatever money you would spend to just get some bigger disks.
You say that you need more space for files on a server that isn't under heavy load, yet the entire reason for having RAID 1 with a hot spare is for absolute reliability of your data (although the performance is pretty good too). If this is no longer important, then go for it.
Optionally, if the system allows this: disconnect one drive from RAID1 putting it into degraded mode, create RAID5 in degraded mode (with one disk missing). Copy over the data, delete RAID1 and add the missing drive to RAID5. This, however, usually takes longer than using an external backup.
