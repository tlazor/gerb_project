No need for further setup, your clients will just appear to be in the same physical network and will get their IP from the DHCP server in the office. You will find it in the open-vpn web-interface: "Configuration -> VPN Mode"
First and foremost I am not a strong networking person but we do not have a network tech here in the office so I got charged with getting this setup and running.  Here is the network topology:
Our internal network, as stated, is a 192.168.1.0/24 network and the address pool that I am using for the VPN is 10.10.11.0/24 (although, for some reason, the VPN Server is setting the mask to 255.255.255.252) I setup a 1:1 NAT so that requests from 10.10.11.0/24 go to 192.168.1.0/24 but things still aren't functioning.  It seems to me like I need to do additional things to the Cisco to make this work but I am unsure as to what those things are. 
On this internal network is a box that is running pfSense and has dual NICs (LAN and WAN) and it's sole purpose in life is to be an OpenVPN box; no other traffic moves through it. Now I have configured the ACL in the Cisco Router properly and am able to connect to the pfSense box with an OpenVPN client without a problem but that is as far as a client gets. The client can not see any of the boxes on the internal network. 
You probably already have a route to the 192.168.1.0/24 network as the "local network" in the OpenVPN GUI config. You're probably missing a route on the Cisco to point the OpenVPN tunnel network back to the LAN IP on pfSense.
