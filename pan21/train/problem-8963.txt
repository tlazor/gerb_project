We have ourselves quite a quandary right now. For some time, we've been planning on setting up a failover cluster for our existing servers. The plan so far has been to set up a 2-node GlusterFS fileserver cluster for mail, websites, and configuration for every other service we run (we currently have servers for SMTP, POP, web, MySQL, DNS, RADIUS, and VoIP), then set up an idle failover server to pick up the load when one of these services dies.
So now I'm stuck in the middle with hardware that we've acquired, and software that we were planning on using that has no way of actually working, as far as I know.
One problem is that most of these servers run Debian. The new GlusterFS cluster is running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, as is our main web server and the failover server. Another problem is that Pacemaker's idea of creating clusters doesn't have anything to do with Debian, and its Ubuntu offering seems to have gone pear-shaped with the release of 14.04. Ubuntu has dropped the cman package and that's pretty much the way Pacemaker makes the cluster work, period.
So my question is, is there another way of accomplishing our goal? "Build a whole new cluster and migrate everything to it" has traditionally been the path of insanity and disaster for us, and we're not about to go down that road again. We have thousands of existing users that we need to make service more reliable for, not less.
