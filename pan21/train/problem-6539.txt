In the past I have used multiple IP segments over a single physical network or VLAN segment when I have wanted to be able to test server response to LAN failures by injecting a fault without losing the ability to collect data from the machines under test.
You can go ahead and share the same switch or hub among two separate "logical" networks. One will use 192.168.1.0/24 and the other will use 192.168.2.0/24. There are some possible caveats:
You have to be somewhat careful in setting up the router that you will be using to connect the IP segments; if you allow the router to send ICMP-redirect packets then the machines will gradually realize that they are actually on the same physical network and will stop talking to one another through the router which ruins a WAN simulation pretty quickly.  
There also is no point in separating the IP segments for security.  Packets visible on the LAN will be visible to all of the receivers on the LAN regardless of whether they are on the same IP segment or not.  To ensure separate visibility you would need to set up a VLAN using appropriate router hardware.  Of course smart routers normally won't send packets that don't have broadcast ethernet frames to port other than the one that contains the destination ether address, but you can't really count on that for security since any client can inject ether frames that will confuse the router into forwarding packets intended for another machine.
