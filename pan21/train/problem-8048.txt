Apart from the powers that come with it, and hence the effects of mistakes, it also comes without any warnings. And it's the warnings that alert you of unexpected things. 
It would be the equivalent of completely disabling UAC and running as admin for all users on a windows box.  Malware can more easily install, drive by downloads are more effective, if there is a penetration they are now god on your computer.  You just effectively remove user priviledges(generally bad practice).  imho, if you haven't had a problem you have either been very lucky, have incredibly safe browsing habits, or the most likely....had a problem and didn't know it.
I've often come across posts on forums or other websites where you see people joking in such a manner about running/logging in as root as if it's something awful and everyone ought to know about it. However, there isn't much that a search reveals on the matter. It maybe widely known to Linux experts, but I really don't know why. I remember always running as root when I first tried Linux years ago (Redhat and Mandrake) and don't remember running into any problems because of that. There are actually some distros that have a bright red background with alert signs all over it as wallpaper for the root user (Suse?). I still use the "Administrator" account for regular use on my Windows installation and haven't ever run into any problems either.
Root on linux is even more powerful than an Administrator account on Windows. It is comparable to the SYSTEM account on windows, which is normally not accessible.
