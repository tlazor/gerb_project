The problem you're running into is that you can't modify permissions on files in use by the operating system.  The other problem you will run into with this approach is that you can't change permissions on files you don't have access to, or will get a UAC prompt on in order to access.
As advised in the comments, you really should be telling us what you're actually trying to do, because I can think of almost no reasons why you'd need or want to universally change the permissions on every file and folder on a Windows system drive, and doing so will cause you issues down the line.
After that's done, you'll need to take ownership of all files, folders and subfolders on the disk before you'll be able to achieve what you want to achieve, allowing Full Control of all files, folders and subfolders on the disk.
The "solution" here is to access the disk when it's not running an operating system.  You do this by mounting the disk as a secondary drive, or booting into another environment that lets you access it without booting into it (Linux LiveCD, WinPXE, etc).
