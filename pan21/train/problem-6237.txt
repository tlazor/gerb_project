I found a small open source utility called "Power Triggers" or "Windows 7 Suspend/Resume Control". Despite not being well-polished or currently maintained, I found this tool to work on Windows 10 without issues. However, to run a script easily on suspend or resume, you have to use version 1.01, and not the latest version.
Having tried some of the prescribed methods in here, I was never able to get a script to run on sleep. The built-in Windows Task Scheduler facilities just didn't fix it.
Mind you you should run the apps with "Start / wait xxx.exe" so the batch file will wait for the command to complete and exit and not reach the shutdown part before other tasks are complete. 
What you can do is create a batch file to do everything you need to before shutting down or hibernating the machine.
I keep alot of my classwork documents hosted on dropbox as well as my personal site for remote storage.  This helps alot since I switch between an iPad, laptop and desktop, so there are no worries about my documents being out of touch.
Problem is, this solution relies on me remembering to execute the sync program (synctoy) for win7, so I'd like a solution to do this automatically.  I've found some scripting help that should work on bootup, but how can I get the script to execute on entering sleep and hibernate, resuming from both, as well as executing before shutdown.
You can create a task that uses any of the following options as triggers for the Task Scheduler in Windows 7:
The last command in that file should be "shutdown xxx yyy " where xxx and yyy are the parameters for the shutdown command. Then you can just run this batch file instead of using any other shutting down command / application.
There's lots to work with there, I'd be looking at the on Idle, on Workstation lock and On Workstation Unlock triggers. That's probably your best bet.
