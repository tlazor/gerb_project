Firstly you should have the snapshot of your volume, it can be done both through console and aws-cli.
I'm having trouble finding documentation that makes this clear.  What is the correct way to add a specific EBS Volume to the block_device_map ?
I would like to launch an EC2 instance using the python boto library, with a previously created EBS volume attached (in addition to the root volume).
Then you start the instance based on the above AMI. Here I drop the sample of creating spot-instance, but creating On-Demand instance is even simpler:
After connecting, I look up the volume by its name tag, and try to create a block device list containing the volume.  I was getting all kinds of errors, but eventually created the following code which at least succeeds in launching an instance.
Unlike Matt says, it is perfectly possible to attach existing EBS volumes to AMI during its creation.
The print statement shows it was able to lookup the volume and reports the correct volume id.  However when the instance launches a new unformatted 32GB volume is created and attached to the volume instead.
