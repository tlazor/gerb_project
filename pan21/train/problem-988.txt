Depends on file size: when I/O dominates, then the CPU of doing the decompress takes less time than the file transfer.  Whether I/O will dominate depends heavily on the relative speeds of your CPU, your storage systems, and the bandwidth between them.
That said, dumping data to standard out (gunzip -c, zcat, etc...) won't trigger writing to a temporary file. The data is piped directly to the grep command, which treats the uncompressed stream as it's own standard in.
It's always going to be quicker to cat the uncompressed file as there's no overhead associated with that. Even if you're not writing a temporary file, you're going through the decompression motions, which munch CPU. If you're accessing these files often enough, it's probably better to keep them uncompressed if you have the space.
gzip -dc | grep foo (or gunzip -c) | grep foo writes to a pipe.  How the pipe is implemented is dependent on your operating system, but generally it will stay in memory.  As others have pointed out, grepping an uncompressed file is always going to be faster due to the time it takes to decompress the compressed data. Using a different compression program may or may not improve performance; you can always measure it.
Your mileage may vary, but on my system, grepping an already uncompressed file took about a third the time that piping zcat or gunzip into grep did. This isn't surprising.
