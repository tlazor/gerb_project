The server is 7 years old now, so way out of warranty. It was still serving in many capacities very well and I would love to get it running again but I can't afford to replace the mobo. Thanks
I believe the CPU was a Pentium D 3Ghz. From what I can find through googling this would suggest an LGA-775 socket, but this plastic holder looks different from anything I have ever seen on an LGA-775 (which I am somewhat familiar with).
Ordering a replacement from Dell may cost too much for a 7 year old server. I would recommend just removing all of Dell's ducting parts and putting a decent LGA775 socket cooler inside. Newegg.com is a great place to look. It will most likely lower your temps anyway taking this route.
After some issues with the CPU fan not slowing down I realized that one of the two plastic hooks that holds a bar in place that keeps the heatsink in contact with the CPU broke. If I had a replacement this would seem to be a very easy thing to fix.
Does anyone know if this heatsink holder is a custom Dell part or part of a socket type I have not seen before? Is this something I can get a replacement for the broken part or will I need to remove it all together and purchase a new heatsink with a different mounting system?
I have an old Dell Poweredge 830 server. I just moved about 250 miles, and in that process broke something in the server.
