To help lessen the chances of a casual would-be OS installer, there are a few things you can do with a Linux server both phyiscal security and software security:
If someone has physical access to your machine then they can do what they want and nothing you can do at the OS level can stop them. The main reason is that they can simply bypass your OS and boot their own from a bootable device.
Law #3 of Computer Security: If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.
For #1: Good (password) practices will prevent such access. If the machine is also "properly" configured then the likelihood of anyone getting root access is very slim ("properly" here refers to your own environment/setup since every machine depends on your environment and functionality - from strong passwords to OS configuration).
In order to replace the OS one needs access to either 1) the existing OS, 2) the machine boot mechanism or 3) plenty of time with the physical machine. I will surpass #3 since in that case we could say that cannot be alleviated ie if I have plenty of time with a physical machine I could as well cut the chains swap out the machine itself and be done with it.
For #2: Server class machines (not only) have mechanisms to prevent an intruder from gaining access to the machine boot sequence (usually boot password and other boot related prevention mechanisms).
