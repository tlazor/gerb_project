To capture all digital channels, including HD channels, in an unprotected format that can be edited you need an HD PVR.  They have native drivers for windows 7 so that you can run the live TV set-up just as if it were a regular TV Tuner. It requires a component video output from your cable box and an IR baster (I'd recommend a normal MCE blaster as the one in the box has poor driver support).  The only real limitation is only one HD PVR can be used with the native drivers, though DVBlink for HDPVR will enable 4 or more tuners at once.

You really don't need an IR blaster unless you intend on controlling your cable box with the remote that controls your computer.  As for the recording part, when I used Media Center 2005 I had no problem recording with Media Center and converting into whatever format I wanted later.  Just get a T.V. Tuner card that has QAM and ATSC since NTSC has been phased out in the U.S.  Hauppauge makes good tuner cards and they would be my first choice as far as brand goes.  Just install the card, hook up the coax cable to the card directly from the wall (you do not even need a cable box) and set Media Center to record what ever you want!  If your computer has an internet connection you can download program guides to make recording scheduling even easier.
Most TV Capture / Tuner cards have software that will let you connect your cable box directly and switch channels, have favorites, etc. There's nothing special really that you need to do.
