Ubuntu 7.10 server i386 clock/date/time won't stay in sync. Are their log files I can view to tell when the clock changes? For a temporary fix, I created a file in /etc/cron.hourly:
However, this still leaves a potential hour of unchecked time. Is there a cron.minutely? That would still leave a potential minute of unchecked time. I have read about CMOS battery problems, but what if this does not fix it? I'd like to be able to troubleshoot this as a completely software problem.
I had the same trouble on a Debian Lenny system (it was an ancient Ubuntu 7.04 install prior to that) due to some flaky chipset on the decade-old motherboard.  Here's my cron solution; for my purposes, twice daily keeps it sufficiently sync'd, and then once weekly it syncs and saves to the hardware clock (which is rock solid on my system).
My squid logs are showing dates back in 2005 when the clock changes, and my time-sensitive access controls are skewed and end up allowing users to surf prohibited websites during business hours.
I had the same problem yesterday but under Slackware 8. To make a long story short, I read a lot on google to finally reimage the computer. My manager sent me that link but it did not fixed my issue.
This uses the standard crontab syntax for setting times and days, so it can get minutely if you want it that fine-grained.  The "logger -i" at the end of the command chain sends the output to syslog's cron logging facilities.
