On the menu go to the Products section and hover on ‘IAM & admin’ and then click on ‘Service accounts’ to see if the default service account hasn’t been deleted.
But when i try Disable COMPUTE API. I'am Also get error Enable/disable steps failed for services [compute.googleapis.com]
If the account is not there it explains why you can’t create a VM using this default service account.
You can disable and re-enable the Google Compute Engine API in your project. This will only work if you have no GCE resource (e.g VMs, Disks, Snapshots, etc) in your project, otherwise you will get "Backend Provisioning Error" when you try to disable Compute Engine API.
You can get another Compute Engine default Service Account by enabling for example the ‘Dataproc’ API:
 - The resource '1045904521672-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com' of type 'serviceAccount' was not found.
I have same issue Default service account for compute engine do not work. Every time when i want create instance with out --service-account flag. With my own service account every thing work fine, But i need deafult to work with docker+machine.
Go to the Google Cloud Platform Console and click on ‘Products & Services’ which is the icon with the four bars at the top left hand corner.
Please note that previous resources created with the previously deleted service account might not function properly.
