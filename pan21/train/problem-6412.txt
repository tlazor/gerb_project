I had a similar problem on my laptop on XP Home SP3 with my USB mouse stalling. After some investigations with process explorer it turned out to be a process called hotkey.exe. This came with my Toshiba laptop. Killing it  fixed the annoying problem for me. I did not really manage to find out how to uninstall it, but you can disable it starting up in msconfig.
Try eventually to plug it directly on a ps2 port (if you have one), to see if the problem wouldn't be from this. I have memories of some Logitech mouse jumping, blocking this way, when it was plugged on usb and not ps2.
In general, give as well a try on another computer, if you have the occasion. If the problem is the same, then probably it's a hardware issue, and it will be hard to fix in another way than sending to mouse back to manufacturer (or seller).
Otherwise, start task manager and sort on CPU usage. You can see if any application has a CPU spike just after your mouse ´pause´.
This probably isn't going to help you much but there are some shockingly bad mice out there. I'm rather picky with mine and I've come across things like this. I tend to just not use stuff that does that.
