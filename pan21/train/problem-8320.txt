Also, you can use the Windows AIK to make a WinPE image, copy the MSTSC.exe (et al) files from a Windows 7 computer into the image and use that. It can be PXE booted, live or RAM / CD or USB, installed to a HD.
I should also mention it supports pulling the local CD drive and attached USB storage devices in to the windows server too--which you may not get from a custom Linux build on a USB key unless you do some coding.
You may also want to include setres, a free program to set the resolution from the command line/scripts/etc. The WinPE default is 800x600 with no built-in way to change it.
I use Ubuntu Server with LTSP.  It's a decent framework made to network boot thin clients into an Ubuntu desktop, but you can actually edit a config file (lts.conf) and tell it to load 'rdesktop' instead of the gnome desktop.  It may not be the best solution for you because it requires an Ubuntu server to easily create/update/hand out the PXE boot images, but it does away with users needing a USB key.
I'm trying to find out what existing options there are out there to boot a machine into a remote desktop (RDP). Ideally the user would have a USB key and just plug it into the machine and boot via it establishing an RDP connection to their virtualised enviroment (stored on a server).
Note: The reference computer the files are copied from must match the version of WinPE you're creating, 32-bit or 64-bit. 64-bit WinPE has no ability to run 32-bit programs and vice-versa.
