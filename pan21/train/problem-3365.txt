My experience with PayPal is that you usually have to re-login to make a purchase. If they have the password to login, then they have the password to change their email. At worst, they can call customer support and have PayPal manually make the updates.
I know this may seem like a customer service run-around but it's because of scams like what this may be that these stances are necessary.
How do you treat such requests? Or is there any way to verify that the person whose PayPal account was used, indeed made this purchase and that someone didn't just steal their PayPal account?
Sometimes a person who made a payment may send me a follow-up email via the feedback on my site, with the message as follows (the actual email I got today, verbatim):
But that has nothing to do with you. Your relationship with this person is as a merchant with a customer. Because of that explain that, in the interest of both your security and their own, you can only deliver to the PayPal registered address or email to the PayPal registered email. (Also, be sure not to give out what those are, also in the interest of security.) Suggest that they contact PayPal customer service to resolve their PayPal issue and that, because it is a PayPal issue, there is nothing you can do to resolve it.
I have a small web site where I sell software that I write. Payments for the registration/license codes for my software are done via PayPal. I have an automated IPN script that links to my PayPal account that processes each payment automatically and then dispatches an email to the buyer's email address associated with their PayPal account, that explains how to register the software and provides a buyer with their personalized registration license code. All in one email.
