You're problem could originate from so many things, it's really unlikely that you'll get an answer that solves your problem.
In case of a software issue, the simplest might be to make a backup. Reinstall Mac OS X and use the Migration Assistent to copy all your previous data to the new system.
Indeed.  I have four macs, three of which I had to move back to 10.6.2 in exactly the way described (reapplying the 10.6.3 combo update doesn't help).  Macbookpro and two minis - different generations - both kept locking up - in the case of the macbookpro within 10 minutes or so of starting work, every time).  Went back to 10.6.2 and all was fine.  Not a hardware issue.  Oh, the mac that wasn't affected is a mac pro desktop.  No idea why, as all the applications software is the same on each machine. 
Snow Leopard 10.6.3 on my Macbook Pro freezes quite frequently now. It freezes for few seconds and then works fine. During that time trackpad does not work and keyboard works partially (missing keystrokes while I type).
Bad fonts are often the cause of otherwise unexplainable behaviour. Use Font Book to verify your fonts and disable any that don't pass. 
Initially it was once or twice in a day but now it has become quite frequent. Is somebody else facing similar issue?
