But what exactly will break in the forwarding operation if we assign LAN addresses that belong to different subnets.
The sending device will send an ARP request broadcast frame on to the network asking for the MAC address of the intended recipient based on the IP address of the destination. The holder of that IP address will respond to the sender advertising the MAC address. They will then be able to communicate with each other with out their traffic having to be routed through a Layer 3 device which is where things start to break down. As already mentioned.
When the default gateway notices that it is sending a packet back out the way it came in it may send ICMP redirect packets to inform the host that it can send the packet by a more direct route. The sending host may or may not take notice of said redirect.
The subnet is used to determine what hosts are "assumed to be on link". If a host wants to communicate with a host outside it's subnet then (assuming there is nothing special in the host's routing table) it will try and send the packet to it's default gateway.
If the default gateway knows about all the subnets and is prepared to send packets back out on the same interface they came in through then communication will work fine. Otherwise things are going to break.
If Host A sends a packet to Host C, the Router will drop the packet since it will not know the LAN to reach 30 network.
