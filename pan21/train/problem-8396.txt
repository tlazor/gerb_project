Ethernet relies on a destination MAC address for frame delivery. The source MAC address will be the MAC address of the outgoing interface which sent the frame. This outgoing interface could be that of the originating node, or of an intermediate router between the originating node and the destination node.
I would suggest reading more about how ARP works on an Ethernet network. This is essentially an on-demand process that is used to determine the destination MAC address (which is used by Ethernet) that is associated with a given destination IP address in order to pass frames from one host to another.
The "neighbor discovery" you're referring to, on an IP network, is the ARP process. Using the term "neighbor discovery" is somewhat of a misnomer here, because there could be multiple devices on the same physical segment that the end host or node is connected to. It all depends on what source host wants to send data to what destination host. All hosts will maintain an ARP table which is essentially a mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses, which the host will use to send frames to, including that of a gateway, which is used to get traffic off of the local segment.
LLDP is used to provide additional information (other than information that would normally be obtained via the ARP process) between two directly connected nodes, whether it be switch to switch, host to switch, host to router, host to host, etc.
