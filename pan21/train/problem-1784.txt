I concur with Ernie regarding the server room environment.  For cleaning machines I like to stay away from canned air as 1) it spreads the dust around to where I can breathe it in and 2) it forces the dust into tiny places that don't react well to little particles (like drive mechanics).  A good shopvac for the big things like vents, power supplies, etc and a micro vac (or micro attachments) for the more sensitive areas.
Clean your systems in a room that is not the server room or personal office. Use a dust mask. Have a small air filter & ionizer running near by. Use compressed or canned air and a battery powered vacuum- deWalt makes a nice one that runs on their standard 18V batteries. Make sure relative humidity is within the acceptable range before doing ANY kind of hardware work. Use grounding mats and straps.
Get a small wireless hand vacuum with a plastic-tipped end (no bristles). I always vacuum my computers when they get dusty, and have been for years. Beats using compressed air which just blows the dust all over the place.
I know I'm pretty allergic to dust.  However, dealing with servers and workstations on a day to day basis, I encounter it all the time.  How do you deal with dust?
