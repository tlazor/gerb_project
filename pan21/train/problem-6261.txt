This is a maintenance hassle waiting to happen, because every manager that I've ever worked with would ask at some point for another item to be added to this list. I would be to pull these items out of a table in the database (if the DB is normalized they should be in a separate table anyway).
That said, what has bitten me on projects like this in the past are "simple" changes that are easy to implement but require the source to be recompiled and redeployed.  This makes the following code section leap out:
I think the answer to you question mainly lies in the level of faith you have in your statement that "this particular application will likely not change or add functionality at any time."  In my experience, its only a matter of time before somebody asks "wouldn't it be nice if..." or the business requirements that drive the application change.  That said, it doesn't look like there is a lot of immediate gain in decoupling this much further at this point.  There may be in the future, but if it does the job right now the addition effort in refactoring might be a little bit premature. I would ask yourself how many use cases there conceivably are at this point - if this is basically just a one-off office automation type project I'm guessing there aren't that many right now.
