I would personally try to understand what UID is involved with the failed transaction and see if granting different ownership or group access would work better, depending both on what I immediately wanted to do and what I might want to do in the future.
In your specific case, chmod'ing the directory to 777 will mean that anyone who can access the directory will have full access to everything.  It may be simplest to grant 777 access to the target directory, do your upload, then immediately lock the directory down.  You do NOT want to leave your system that way.
Wordpress is trying to write to a directory so it really only needs access as the user it's being run as. Annoyingly I think that Wordpress checks the user of a directory rather than its ability to write to it, so this might be your problem. Alternatively, create a php file inside the website with <?php phpinfo(); ?> inside it. Browse to this page and double check that PHP safemode isn't turned on (another common issue with PHP's writing). Also, check the error log for that website as it will contain a lot of useful information.
As Christopher Evans said, chown the plugin and temp directories to the user (or group) the web server is running as and set appropriate permissions.  If you don't have access to chown the directories you're pretty much stuck with setting the mode to 777 (world-writable).
Evertything else is the abbreviated Unix permissions lecture - you can get the same thing from man chmod with lots more detail.
The exception to this is root.  Any file that root has root control over can't be denied to root(*).
Think of it as three separate numbers, and from left to right it stipulates that access that the user, group and anyone else has. By everyone it means anyone who is logged into your server (via FTP, SSH or anything else).
I have a Wordpress CMS and I'm trying to install a plugin, however it has decided it can't download the plugin to a temp directory, so I'm guessing I need to chmod something, doesn't say what. But I don't want to chmod to 777 and give anyone access to the server?
If you give everyone 7 permissions (which means read, write AND execute), they can do any of those things. In terms of a directory, they need execute to open the directory so the only really issue is the w, which means they can create a new file inside the directory or rename it. If your webserver can create .php files inside the DocumentRoot, this is very bad in the instance that your website somehow allows this (not as unusual as you'd think).
So you can have a file that actually grants more access to people other than the group or owner of the file:
If I Chmod a directory a to 777. What exactly does Everyone mean? Anyone who connects with FTP without using the password or something else?
(*) = using this mechanism.  Things get more complicated with ACLs and extended attributes, but that's beyond this question's scope
Each field is a bitmask, with the values being 1 (execute (& list contents of a directory)), 2 (Write) and 4 (Read)
