it is possible (but not likely) that when you return the results on the server you are starving the server for resources because of the need to display all the results in SSMS.
That said, I've no idea why this might be acting like that, but I would look into your indexes on your tables to see if they're appropriate, or if they even exist, and then run the query optimiser to get its opinion.
same machine, same DB, same code, one run from c# project, the other run from SSMS, there must be a bug or issue with SSMS
Have you compared the execution plans from both servers?  Have you tried querying your production server locally, when the results slow down?  Have you checked to see if you have any blocking, or resource waits on your production server?
Then open a new query window, press CTRL + D (to ensure results output to grid) and run your query again.  Does it still take 45 mins?
In SSMS on the server go to Tools->Options->Query Results->SQL Server->Results to Grid.  Check the option discard results after execution
45 mins vs 60 seconds? That's... unusual. I've seen 45 minute queries before, but never anything in the realms of something as simple as "select col1 from table". Even 60 seconds should retrieve hundreds of thousands of records in that time.
