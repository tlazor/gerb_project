 Go to: http://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/toolbar/ie/index.html . Click on "Download Google Toolbar". Then be sure you've checked "Set Google as default search in Internet Explorer and notify me of changes". Click on "Accept and Install". Let Google do its thing. Restart IE11. After restart you'll be asked if you want to enable toolbar - you can leave toolbar disabled. Dialog box will pop up to choose Search Provider - obviously choose Google. Then go to: Tools>Manage Add-ons>Search Providers and get rid off Bing if you like. That's it. You're good.
If you install Firefox or Chrome, they both have google as default search engine. If you are using IE, click on the gear wheel (top right corner) and choose Manage Add-on.
Once added, you check again the "manage add-on" page, and click on Google, and click "Set as Default" and click on the Bing Bar, and remove (if you wish).
Click on Search Provider, and choose "Find more search providers" which will bring you to Microsoft Internet Explorer Addon Gallery - do a search on the site for Google and click "Add to Internet Explorer".
