The other factor here is the TTL.  Hosts can cache DNS responses for as long as the TTL specifies, and often do (especially if they are windows hosts).  So, they may continue to use the obsolete record after a host is renumbered.  One way to manage this is to reduce the TTL while renumbering; the other way is to manually clear caches.
I can't tell how your client workstations are getting DNS settings.  However, if it is by DHCP, you need to update the DNS server option on your DHCP server and wait for renewals to happen or trigger them yourself.  If you have manually configured DNS servers, you will need to go in and update all of them by hand.
It's also possible that, if your new DNS server is giving out old IP addresses, dynamic updates are not working on your clients or you need to update your static zone data.
In any case, it's often a good idea to leave the old DNS server in place for a period and have it forward requests to the new DNS server (instead of serving old DNS data); while doing this, monitor it for any DNS traffic at all, and root out and correct any hosts which may still be referring to it.  This might expose other DHCP servers elsewhere in the network giving out bad settings, or hosts with statically configured nameservers.
