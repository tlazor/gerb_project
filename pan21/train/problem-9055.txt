It looks like there is not going to be a straightforward answer for this. It is going to require investigation and debugging of your system. Fortunately most of us here love doing exactly that, so letâ€™s start. :)
To fix this problem I changed the keyboard button allocation from 'Default Task' (IE: Calculator) to 'Launch Program', then browse to the calculator application (often located in 'C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe') then clicked Apply.
One was this could happen is if that key is mapped to a shortcut with Run set to Minimized.  What kind of MS keyboard?
Try mapping it to something else, say Notepad for example. What happens? Try mapping a different extended button to the Calculator. What happens then? The goal of this step is to see if it is the calculator that is the problem or the specific button.
Whilst my keyboard is not a MS keyboard but a Logitech keyboard, I had the same problem. It would either start minimised or out of focus. It was very annoying especially as I use it a lot.
