You could just create an XY scatter plot with dates as X and values as Y. The spacing will be correct and the dates will appear in the X axis labels. Sort the values by date and use the connected line scatter plot type.
Which should search in column A for every date and put the number in column B associated with it, or 0 if nothing is found (the IFERROR wrap is needed for that, otherwise it shows N/A). Then autofill column E and you should be able to make a chart on columns D and E. Takes up some space but it's easy and it works. You can hide it on another sheet if it looks too messy. 
I am looking for the simplest possible approach. If I wanted to bypass Excel, I could just adjust the input data with Perl or something.
Etc. The problem is, the chart does not show a proper trend since many dates have no occurrences or value for that date. So, in the chart, things look fine, but are distorted since there are no dates with a value of 0. How can I fill in this sequence of dates with 0 values for the missing dates?
I'm a big fan of vlookups. Assuming your data is in columns A and B, make a range of dates down column D using the autofill (type 11/1/14 in D1, then drag the bottom-right corner down). Then in E1 use:
If you right click on the chart and select "select data" a dialog box pops up.  In the bottom left portion of this dialog box is a button for hidden and empty cells.  It is here you can select zeros for missing information.
