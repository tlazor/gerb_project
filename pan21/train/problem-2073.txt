What seem to have worked for me is the metric setting. What it does is that if two internet connections are available, the data will flow through the one with lower value. This presumably also makes the connection persist, if it has the lower value, when the other one is then connected.
I believe this a safety reason as both your wifi and Ethernet are on the same network and it would cause a conflict if both would work at the same time. Just go to your network and sharing center --> Change adapter settings, disable your wired connection and enable your WIFi.
Or just make sure the wired connection is on a different network. (It can be used for internet sharing for example)
In my case the problem was a Windows service called "Wireless_AutoSwitch." I have no idea how or why it was installed but disabling it fixed the problem.
You can get here by opening Control Panel, Network and Internet, Network and Sharing Center, Change Adapter Settings (left side) and then press ALT once and you'll see a menu appear. Go to Advanced -> Advanced Settings. Now you will have the window open shown above in the screenshot. The idea is to put your wireless adapter as high as possible. Press OK to save. You might have to restart your PC in order to let the setting take effect.
