DVI latency is set by the time it takes to transmit one frame. This is, in turn, set by the video frame rate. At 60 Hz, it takes 1/60 second (16.7 ms) to transmit one frame, so there's 16.7 ms latency in the link.
With dual-link DVI, a resolution of 2048 x 1536 is possible ( about 1.5x the number of pixels). Using 2560x1600 resolutions with PCoIP products (15134-1607) then 2x the number of pixels is possible with dual-DVI.
No. At least, not in the sense that replacing a single-link cable with a dual-link one will change video latency.
There is a popular myth.. or reality.. I always wondered, what if i will connect Dual-Link DVI at 1920x1080? Does it ever produces any benefits over single link DVI connection? E.g. theoretically it have to has 2x more bandwidth and frame has to be transferred to my monitor 2x faster, over almost same electrical interface, which is just 2x wider. And IF (Sorry, I really do not know real specs, just for case) SL-DVI provides 1ms transfer lag, then do DL-DVI provide 0.5ms input lag? Am I correct in my assumptions?
The DVI link between a graphics card an monitor can operate at a bandwidth of 165MHz and no more. At 60Hz this leads to a maximum resolution of 1920x1080.
Some video resolution/framerate configurations may require a dual-link cable. For instance, a 2560x1440 monitor will require dual-link DVI to run at 60 Hz. However, every monitor also has a maximum resolution and frame rate, and most 1080p or smaller monitors do not require dual-link DVI to run under that maximum configuration. Using a dual-link cable will not make any difference for them.
