Synergy is good, but if you want an effective software KVM try InputDirector. I've found it to a lot more stable and bug free. Even more plug and play is Mouse without Borders from Microsoft.
You should be able to see the log file if you use the 'test' button to run a test on the server instead of running it as a service.  This will run it as normal but pop up a window with the log messages in it.
You should be able to telnet to the server on port 24800 from the client and get a connection.  If not, either a firewall is blocking the connection or the Synergy server isn't running.
Not being content with leaving my firewall off all the time on my Windows 7 machine, I added the server executable to the list of applications the firewall lets through and turned it back on. To do this (on Windows 7, at least):
If the Synergy server is 'quitting with errors' then it won't be running so the clients will have nothing to connect to.
I was having the same problem, where I was able to get the client to connect initially, but then it just stopped working. It turns out that I had rebooted my host machine, which re-enabled the firewall. As soon as I disabled the firewall on the server, the client connected immediately.
After hitting OK, my client connected immediately. I didn't even have to restart the client or the server. I hope this helps someone get connected. Synergy is a beautiful thing when it works!
