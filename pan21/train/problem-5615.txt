I've deployed it in the past as a decent replacement for Exchange. The Outlook plugin can lag a bit a bit behind the current version of outlook - took 6 months for a plugin for outlook 2007, for example. 
Yes, I'm a little late for the party and not a little surprised that OX hasn't been mentioned. I'm pretty sure it meets and/or exceeds the OP's requirements.  And for another option, keep your ear to the rails to see what Cisco does with PostPath which was a promising Exchange alternative.
I installed the network version of Zimbra for a company last summer.  It meets everyone of your needs plus support palm, blackberry and windows mobile over the air sync.  It was very slick and the Outlook connector worked very well for not only mail but Calendaring and resource scheduling as well.  It has a great web front end and *nix users can use Thunderbird & Firebird to access e-mail, contact list and calendaring or use the Zimbra full client which is basically the web client running on a local light weight web server.
