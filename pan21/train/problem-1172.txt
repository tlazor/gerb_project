We make it a point not to rely on physical media for precisely this purpose.  When we get physical media, it is ripped to ISO almost immediately and put on a dedicated file server along with text files including any registration/serial info needed.  We generally throw out product manuals (especially the bulky ones) because more often than not, digital copies can be found online from the vendor if needed.  We do still keep the physical media and serials, but it generally lives in CD/DVD binders in a storage room somewhere since we never have to access it.
For OS media, I generally threw the minimum necessary for booting onto a thumb drive that I kept around my neck and did the rest of the installation from http-based media.
Physically moving a facility and there are boxes, folders, and stacks of software installation media everywhere.
Physical media can be hard to keep track of, especially if you're in an environment where you have several people who might be carrying the media around to various locations (or worse, where you have to loan your media out to end users.  Don't laugh, it's a fact of life in academia).  I've always kept physical media in a file cabinet, using a different hanging file for each package.  ISOs were copied to a server in case I ever needed to make a new version, although most applications were installed via rdist (Linux) or SCCM (Windows).
