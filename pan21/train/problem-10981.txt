It's just so VirtualBox can select the optimum and supported default settings of the VM you create. You can alter these as you want in the "Settings" afterward. Some OS's have better support for some drivers, some doesn't have 3d Acceleration support and so on.
Another optimization is the virtual graphics driver. A Linux guest will get a OpenGL virtual card while Windows will get a DX9 card.
I've noticed VirtualBox suggests the default memory and disk size based on your OS selection. There are also additional prompts, such as one for account creation (certain OSes) before the installation to streamline the installation process.
One very useful optimization that I know of is spin-lock detection. When Windows enters a CriticalSection or Linux enters a pthread_mutex_lock, the CPU usage will briefly go to 100% while it waits for another CPU to finish. If the VM knows about that it can make sure to run the other CPU thread immediately.
Mainly so it can best select the settings it feels would be well suited for your PC plus That virtual machine. Also its used to streamline things and stuff like that. Like virtual box mainly does this for its "guest additions" pack which is used to help it use devices on the host machine and share folders back and forth between the host and virtual machine.
VirtualBox also provides guest additions to supported OSes. For the whole list, including caveats, take a look here.
