The issue may be with your DNS cache. Try running ipconfig /flushdns from the Windows command prompt. If you have the UAC enabled, you may need an elevated command prompt session (right click on cmd.exe and select "Run as Administrator")
There is a workaround that involves a simple registry edit. This is useful if you cannot upgrade Covenant Eyes for some reason or your issue is related to the Chrome blacklist service, but not Covenant Eyes.
I suddenly had this problem and I realised that I had a WIRED internet connection AND a WIRELESS connection active and it seemed to be causing Chrome not to connect. Turned the WiFi off and it started working straight away!
The registry edit workaround has mixed reviews on this page. Some say it works, but reverts back after closing Chrome. Others report that it works perfectly and they can close Chrome and it will not revert. The reason is not clear, but most with the Covenant Eyes issue are reporting that it is working perfectly for them. A few users without the Covenant Eyes issue have reported that the registry edit worked for them as well.
Norton 360 Premier Edition has caused me problems in the past and I just had it happen again. Turned off Smart Firewall and Chrome started working. So I turned it back on and Chrome wouldn't work. Went to Programs in Norton and enabled Google Chrome and it works fine now.
The problem is likely related to Chrome and a black list service that is new and apparently not ready. The blacklist service (wrongly) blocks some dll's, most common being one that is used by an internet filtering software called Covenant Eyes. According to Covenant Eyes customer support, the problem only exists on versions 4.5.3 and earlier. Upgrading to version 5, which requires a full uninstall of the previous version, will fix the issue.
