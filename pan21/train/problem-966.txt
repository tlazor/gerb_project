Well, most of the time (absent someone's attempts to screw with things) your TERM will be set to screen (or at least mention screen somewhere).
The easy solution to the problem is just run screen everywhere.  Don't leave home without it, I say.
I have to thank Kyle Rankin of Linux Journal for this.  See his fantastic article at http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10950.  The man page section he refers to can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#String-Escapes.
Add the following to your ~/.screenrc and you'll see a status line down the bottom (showing in inverted text the date, time and system load.  More escape codes found in man page link below.
you could also recurse up the process tree from $$ to see if you find a screen instance. the exact chain will probably depend on your setup--on my OS X box, a zsh inside screen has login as its parent, SCREEN as its grandparent, and screen as its great-grandparent.
Look for $STY which provides details that screen uses to communicate with itself; $WINDOW will then be the current screen window number.
