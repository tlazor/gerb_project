You don't need to partition the devices. ZFS can use slices, fdisk or GPT partitions but doesn't require any of them. Using the unpartitioned whole device is actually the recommended way when possible.
According to this it should be fairly straightforward. I don't think the partitions themselves matter as much, but your I think disk label needs to be SMI.
First, ZFS needs to be able to trigger the device's onboard cache to flush when a synchronous write is requested, to ensure that the write is really on stable storage before returning to the application.  It can only do this if it controls the whole device.  If using a slice, ZFS cannot issue the cache flush and you risk losing data during an unexpected shutdown.
Second, the SSD, while very fast, is still a finite resource.  Sharing that resource between pools means that the expected performance of the device from either pool's perspective could be vastly different if the drive is busy serving IOPS from the other pool.  The end result is that you could have worse performance than if you didn't use the SSD at all.
