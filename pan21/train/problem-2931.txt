I think Matt Hanson has exactly what the problem is, I ran into this a few weeks ago with an XP install on a new laptop model.
You have two options, either do what Matt suggested and go into your BIOS and see if you can switch your disk controller into a "Legacy" or "ATA" mode.
You're going to have to remove and replace piece by piece to find out what's going on. So if you suspect the hard drive, put another hard drive in it and see if that one works better.
Or if your PC or MoBo came with a driver disk it may have a set of DOS-mode (or Windows pre-setup) drivers that you can insert when Windows setup gives you the "Press F5 to load SCSI disk drivers" prompt. Otherwise if you can find out exactly which SATA controller and version is on your motherboard, then you can probably download the Windows setup drivers from the manufacturer's website.
Some components can fail after they heat up to a certain point, yes. But there's no way to give you a definitive answer on what's happening based on the information you provide...
Make sure your install cd is clean and drive is working correctly.  I have seen some crazy errors halfway into a windows install because the disc was dying or the cd drive was flaky. If those are good, then you might have other hardware issues.
Possibly an AHCI/RAID driver issue? An easy way to check would be to change the BIOS setting for the SATA mode from AHCI/RAID to legacy.
If failures are not occurring at the same point in the install, then it's most likely you have failing hardware in your PC as opposed to just a driver incompatibility issue.
Windows XP (even SP3) doesn't have any pre-setup drivers for SATA disk controllers in it, so setup gets to a point where I can't even find a hard disk controller and blue screens. If your machine is less than a couple of years old then you almost certainly have a SATA hard disk.
