I have a scenario in which one computer needs to be a member of two subnets on the same physical network - 192.168.2.0/24 and 192.168.3.0/24. I have achieved this using ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.3.123/24 up etc. The problem arises when I am trying to start a telnet session with another host, which is also a member of those two subnets. That host is accessible via telnet on both IP addresses, but when I try to connect to it, telnet hangs. This problem disappears when I remove either one of the two interfaces. I think it is also worth mentioning that there is no problem in Windows, with the same multiple IP setup. Since the host I am trying to connect to cannot be configured or modified, is it possible to solve this problem, say, by restricting 192.168.3.0 traffic only to eth0:1, or, perhaps having a different MAC address on that pseudo interface?
It sounds to me like a problem with the source IP address.  I imagine there are multiple ways to fix this.  Possibly the easiest would be to disable reverse path filtering.
An alternative option may be to rewrite packets to ensure the leaving address always matches the subnet with a couple of snat rules - possibly something like
