First, you might need to have to install the Windows N version. A good idea to do this is to download a legit Windows 7 ISO, and then use a file called "ei.cfg remover". This will make the ISO a universal one that will allow you to install any version.
I have  "Windows 7 Professional N" from the Dreamspark webstore and Installed it on a new PC. Now when I try to activate it the key is refused with a message: "Please enter a Windows 7 Professional Key". As I copy&pasted the key from the Dreamsparke site I am pretty confident, that the key is valid. Any suggestions?
Also, when it comes to activation, you might need to update it before. However, you then run in a moment 22 because it requires a activation to receive certain windows update, and vice versa.
If the activation system says that the key is not valid for activation, and suggest you purchase a new key, select the option "Use the automated phone system to activate".
Select Windows 7 Pro N then when it ask. Some keys are universal and some keys are restricted to the N/non-N version.
The reason you might need SP1, is because sometimes Microsoft run out of product keys, thus they create a new set of product keys, that are shipped with SPx versions. Thus the SPx product keys are only valid for SPx since non-SPx version do not recongnize the series, and thus you need to update first.
Certain key series, especially OEM and some promo/free keys like "student keys" and such, are banned for online activation and require phone activation.
To solve this, download "Windows 7 SP1 network & IT administrator installation package" on Microsofts website, and install.
