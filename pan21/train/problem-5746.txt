And get someone you can call for config. Really. And learn from him - develoeprs should know the basics of network admin.
Simply - dont change anything on the server. The router will anyway use NAT.... put in a reverse NAT mapping so that requests to specific ports no the public IP address get forwarded to the server. As you dont change anything on the server, it still is reachable from the office.
If you want a machine to be accessible via both a public and private network the most simple method of setting that up is to install a second network card into the server. That way the machine will be able to communicate with both the private and public networks. Once both network cards are installed you would need to make sure that the server has both a public and private ip address or alternatively is configured to be in the DMZ for the public network or has port forwarding setup for the public network. Then you can configure your web server to serve requests for both the public and private ip addresses. You would also want to make sure that the server has a firewall in place to prevent access to services that should only be accessible via the private network.
