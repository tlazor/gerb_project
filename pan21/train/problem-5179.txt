So, i tried any of major browsers and all they shows problems like that. in chrome problems persists too.
But that has become less common, due to both ClearType and high-resolution LCDs – e.g. even Microsoft's own Consolas practically requires antialiasing / font smoothing to be drawn properly. Likewise with Roboto. And since practically everyone has antialiasing enabled, the Windows font renderer hasn't been made smart enough to try to 'auto-hint' fonts.
That's pretty much 'normal'. The issue is not with websites or browsers, but with Windows and the fonts themselves.
html4 websites fonts are ok, in this example checked site is youtube, but problems are happened in modern websites, i think google fonts are problematically, but not sure.
Traditionally, Arial and other fonts which came with Windows itself were optimized for low-resolution pixellated screens – the people who created Arial and Times New Roman actually spent time aligning everything to the pixel grid, using TrueType "hinting instructions", and in some cases even including bitmap versions for specific sizes.
When your user-agent is "IE6", YouTube uses a simplified stylesheet with only basic fonts, such as Arial. When the user-agent is that of a modern browser, which can load fonts over the web, YouTube starts using its own fonts such as Roboto.
