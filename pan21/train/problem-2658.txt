When you have two drives in RAID1 it will show up as a single drive because the computer is writing data to them synchronously, so you have redundant storage.
Now, if it told you it wasn't properly unmounted before disconnecting, but you can see your data, it's likely that you didn't lose much, if anything. The last thing you wrote to the disk, if you wrote anything in the recent past to them, could potentially be corrupted, but that's all I'd expect.
If you cannot see any data on the disks, I would first try doing a physical scan on the drive (Windows uses scandisk, I don't know what Mac has) and have it apply any repairs it can. This won't destroy any data that is intact, and should let you see it. If data is damaged, then you're probably out of luck without any other backups.
If the scandisk option doesn't help, it may be prudent to use data recovery software to try and retrieve the files off the drive. There's a lot of different software out there if you Google for it. Then after you're certain you've recovered your files, I'd do a full reformat of the drive.
