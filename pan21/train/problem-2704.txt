Do you mean the client connections establish slowly when pointing to AG listener, and want to avoid that? if so, that is usual/known issue particularly when availability groups configured in multi sub-net environment, and the issue is due to default timeout for a TCP connection attempts from client to DNS Server.
During a failover, all client requests are terminated. This is your application downtime. Now, after the failover, when a client reconnects to the AG listener, the listener will reconnect to the new primary (except for read intent connect requests).
The Availability group (AG) listener directs incoming connections to either primary or read replica depending on how the AG is configured (whether it allows read requests or not).
However, even in single sub-net using additional parameter (MultiSubnetFailover=Yes) within connection string could make client connections faster than normal. For more details..
When a failover occurs, a role reversal happens and a secondary replica transitions to the primary role and the former primary will transition to a secondary role.
