It was also prevent the issues associated with trying to store the state of a constantly changing file system in sync with a database in your propsed method. 
If you use RDP, you get encryption, you get one port to open on your firewall, and you get standardization of utilities (no "I made this at home and it worked fine, why won't it open here?" complaints) plus centralized management. I've seen similar problems like this solved in exactly this manner several times and only under specific circumstances has there been issues with it.
Plus you don't have students with multiple copies of documents running around complaining that they don't know WHY their paper is the wrong version because it worked FINE at home...or they didn't save it to the right spot...etc.
What exactly do they need to do? Just get access? If you open it up to FTP, you're asking for big issues. If they need access to consistent tools to work on documents from school, open a server (or cluster) for remote desktop services.
Users would be able to access their files from a browser, and modern versions of Windows and OS X allow users to mount WebDAV shares under Explorer and Finder respectively. 
Yes, they need to install remote desktop client if they don't already have it (they probably already do) but the client is available for Linux, Windows, and the Mac for free. The connection is encrypted, and they can have access to whatever your school is using for Office or other tools, unless you're running something heavy duty like Photoshop.
