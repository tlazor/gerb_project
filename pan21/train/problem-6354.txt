My computer has some anti-virus software installed that runs constantly and checks for what it believes are malicious executables. I cannot disable or control the anti-virus software.
I believe that the most appropriate solution for your case is to configure your anti-virus program by creating an exception to the files/folders desired.
I have dropbox installed and am trying to sync some executables that I know to not be malicious, but the anti-virus program believes they are.
I've tried to determine which "user" the dropbox applications runs as. Initially I thought it was my user, but when I removed permissions on the file for all expect my user dropbox notifies me that it "can't sync  access is denied".
Is it possible to set the permissions of the file such that dropbox can access it but the anti-virus software cannot? Has anyone accomplished something like this?
I should also clarify that I am not trying to sync permissions across my machines, I am aware that doing that isn't possible yet.
Shortly after Dropbox syncs the file to my computer the anti-virus software deletes it (puts in quarantine) and dropbox proceeds to remove it from all my other dropbox computers.
I hoped I could modify permissions of the file to prevent this from happening. I believe this comes down to determining which users both dropbox and the anti-virus run as (and the groups those users are in), and then configuring the appropriate permissions.
