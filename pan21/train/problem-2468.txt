Of course, do your own capacity planning. Do a rough estimate by multiplying the number of issues expected by a few KB. 
I sorta think either gitlab or trac would be nice, and I couldn't ask which one to choose, in order to avoid opinion polling. However there's some thing... I would really want to use as little persistent storage as possible.
Do you have any data or intuition about relative gitlab "expectable" size bloat relative to trac? (I mean, trac is older, so it's sensible to think it would have somewhat a lower persistent storage footprint) Or gitlab figures relative to any other similar software, or trac figures relative to any other similar software.
If you don't want to store a database, let someone else do it. Both GitLab and Trac have hosted options. Or outsource just PostgreSQL to a managed service.
GitLab requirements are documented. Starting at the total size of your repos, and the database at least 10 GB.
I'm considering between hosting my own issues tracker, or embrace any of gitlab.com, Bitbucket, Sourcehut, etc.
Trac doesn't state minimum storage nearly as explicitly, but the same repos + 10 GB seems sane to me.
