Today I've made an update for my Fedora 18 and get 19th version. On previous versions I had troubles with nvidia drivers (I have a laptop). Neither nvidia drivers from package nor from nvidia site didn't work for me. It somehow completely crashes Xorg so I can't work.
Has worked for me reliably in diverse scenarios, although I should note that Clonezilla failed to work when trying to clone a CentOS 7 server that I recently installed, no clues why.
If your new setup fails, just boot again with clonezilla and pull your saved image, boot sector et al included. 
Days passed. I want to try it again (primarily to use external screen that can't be used with default drivers). But I don't want to reinstall the system in case it won't work. So I'm searching for a solution how to make a snapshot of a whole system so I can restore it if I want. Not only snapshot of /home partition but the whole system.
I usually boot the system with a clonezilla CD (http://clonezilla.org/) and follow the instructions. Typically I'll use a NFS resource with large storage capacity, but at home it also worked fine with an external drive.
This method will also help to do multiple installs from a fully loaded & already configured system, if all your target machines are identical. It is pretty fast, some 10~15 minutes per installation, YMMV. However, you may need to take care of network parameters later, due to the changed MACs.
