However some things I can suggest are below. These may reduce impact of using https but will not reduce that initial 100ms connection delay:
HTTPS does slow your website down despite all claims to the contrary. This is because the client and server need to negotiate the SSL/TLS ciphers before it can start. However after that, the slowdown is negligible for most sites, and there are massive benefits to SSL.
I would also advise you regularly run your server through https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html to test your SSL/TLS config as things constantly change in this space as new vulnerabilities are found.
Your SSL/TLS config actually looks pretty good, both in terms of security and performance. You are using modern and speedy ciphers and suites (though your cipher suite is very restrictive to new browsers only and if that's intentional then you might as well turn off TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 as well), have SSL Caching set up (to save clients renegotiating an SSL session for each connection), and SSL Stapling set up (to save the client an extra lookup to check the validity of your cert).
100ms is actually not that bad a slowdown for initial connection and, as I say, after that the connection will be established and so there will be no slowdown. So first up, although initial connection speed is important, browsing around a site is also very important and here you shouldn't be affected by the 100ms slowdown.
Additionally the default is http, so someone entering that for a https-only site will need redirecting to the https version leading to another round trip.
