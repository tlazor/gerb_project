The problem with 1u servers is they typically have tiny fans that have to spin at 9 billion rpm in order to move enough air to keep the thunderingly hot CPUs cool.
Had the same issue with a group of dl145g2's running in my basement lab.  Popped the top disconnected all the fans (except the powersupplies).  Mounted two cpu fans and replaced the hd's with ssd devices.
There are products like this that are designed to keep things in the rack quiet.  I see such things on craigslist from time to time, usually from failed musician/geeks who wanted to run a home recording studio.  You can't put much into these because you'll overwhelm their cooling capacity.
That wouldn't be possible with your setup because the HP 1u servers have custom motherboards that wouldn't fit into anything else.
My suspicion is you could combine these two approaches to dramatically improve airflow with reduced fan noise.
If you are able to monitor temperatures inside your systems accurately (via ipmi for example) then you can do some experimenting.  Try disconnecting some fans in the case and see how that affects cpu and hard drive temperature.  Obviously this is a little risky but could be one way to reduce the noise.
One thing I've always wanted to try is carefully segmenting the airflow between the front and the back of the rack (with handmade cardboard cutouts and gaff tape). Then, rig up air ducts with larger diameter fans pushing air into the front of the rack and pulling it out of the back.
The one thing to remember is that everything that baffles sound almost always baffles in the heat.  You could always find a working old refrigerator to mount it in
I have a couple of rackable systems that I don't use because they make way too much noise.  They've got something like 9 fans, all of them the little tiny noisy kind.  I've reused some of the kit by moving the motherboards to another case with larger fans.
