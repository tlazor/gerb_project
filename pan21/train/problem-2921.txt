ASCII games are really nothing more than just tile-based games that use character glyphs instead of pictures of what they really represent. In general, height fields do not work well in tile-based games. Not unless it's in some kind of perspective view. Height fields generally are used for 3D terrain.
Personally for my project, I'll be using ASCII symbols the represent the map, and an OpenGL rendered gradient map to display the height of the mapped terrain.
It depends on what you want to use to display your map.  If height is an important part of it, you may want to switch away from a curses style output to something more like SDL or OpenGL (unless you plan on using a central server or the likes).  Also, these don't preclude you from using ASCII symbols to represent everything else either.
When your palette of tiles is limited to whatever characters happens to be in the ASCII character set and the particular font to be displayed, you have to put forth some effort in comparing the different glyphs to see which ones look good "in front of" the others. In general, when it comes to ASCII art, the glyphs with less stuff in them are darker and can thus represent farther away terrain.
Or you can just ditch the ASCII art and put together a real black-and-white tilemap. You're more likely to get good results and it really doesn't require that much more work than ASCII tilemaps.
