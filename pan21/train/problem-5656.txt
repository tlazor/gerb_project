As far as price, I haven't looked at quotes in a while, but Dell tends to be hard to beat on price alone. 
For office support issues, I have found Dell "quicker" and generally seem keen to respond , but HP has been better at resolving problems the first time. My mental comparison would be of a young, eager, well dressed Nerd-Herd technician, but not necessarily as experienced from Dell versus a cranky, gruff older tech who may be also slightly socially awkward or aloof, but solid skills from HP in terms of technical support. Sure, Dell delivered a replacement Hard drives in mere hours from placing a service call in a small Canadian city, but they also had 3 or 4 trips to replace a motherboard in a single server due to a safety recall (fire hazard). Yes, motherboard, not power supply.
If I were setting up for a small business....I'd recommend Macintosh/OS X for the workstations... Spend more up front for hardware, but your support costs will be lower in the long run.
Where I work, we use the term workstation to refer to a scientific / CAD / engineering caliber platform, that runs GNU/Linux, or could run Solaris / *BSD. 
For those sort of systems I'd personally prefer HP, who still shows a bit of their HP roots (as well as Tandem, Compaq, & DEC). I haven't used or evaluated IBM's systems in a few years now, but I'd likely consider them. I've found the Dell Precision series disappointing in my own experience, with BIOS quirks, poor RAID controllers. 
For more "Office Technology" (i.e. running MS Office) computer systems, we tend to consider typical PC suppliers, Dell, HP, and just about anyone else with a can do on-site support and replacement nationally.
