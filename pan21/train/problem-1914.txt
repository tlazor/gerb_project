According to this technet article, the largest FAT32 volume that Windows can create is 32GB. There are other methods to make larger volumes, since the theoretical max is 2TB, but you'll find support for large FAT32 volumes to be sparse.
It isn't difficult to format even a 3TB drive with FAT32. Get a disk format utility from any major hard disk manufacturers' websites. DON'T use the MBR option, instead use the GUID option for the partition table, select FAT32 and let the utility do the rest. Reboot and all sorted! 
Alternatively you can use a media player like WDTV live & attach the 1TB HDD but when you're on a tight budget, there's no real need if you can format the HDD to FAT32
TV sets only recognise FAT32 partitions. Using an external HDD instead of a USB stick is great for storing home movies. Most modern video cameras have an 80GB HDD so you need somewhere to dump these files/movies to allow you to take more family videos.
While you're using larger drives, obviously you will be using large files to work with. there are several limitations with FAT32 file system including the size of the files, size of the volume can be created. Later it will be hard to go back if you use FAT32. exFAT is an alternative but I am not sure how well it performs better than NTFS. NTFS is a mature file system and most of the operating system supports read and write (especially Linux). So I'd suggest you to stay-back with NTFS for better performance and reliability.
NTFS has no support and 'might' be OK if there is an IT technical department very close by. For home PCs using FAT32 is much more sensible as if/when there are problems, there's a much better chance of fixing most of what can go wrong. With NTFS the only option is an advanced data recovery commercial program such as Recoverer Ultimate Pro and even then you need restore space on another hard drive.
