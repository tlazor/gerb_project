Im trying to setup a Windows Server Hyper-V 2012 r2 server which I've installed, but am having issues connecting to it throught the Hyper-V manager on Windows 10. I have followed various instructions about WinRM and CredSSP however I still have the following issue. I launch the hyper-v manager and click 'Connect to server'. I put in the ip address and set the username and password for the hyper-v server. When I click 'Ok' however, I get an error saying 'This computer is not configured to allow delegation of user credentials'. If I click 'Yes' to suposedly allow it to delegate the credentials, the message pops up again. If I click no I get another error saying 'Could not connect to the Virtual Machine Management' and 'A computer policy does not allow the delegations of the user credentials to the target computer'. I can access and control it fine with the Server Manager. Any thoughts?enter image description here
Is the Hyper-V server along with Management host joined to the domain? In the case it's not please see the following link - https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/14c1cb56-c99d-4910-ad17-ec13117e090f/remote-connect-to-hyperv-host-machine-from-windows-10-console?forum=winserverhyperv
