So we got kind of a mess there, and our branch's head set a task to clean everything up and implement file naming convention, like:
date[yyyy-mm-dd]_name_doc.number_company_doc.type.[ext] ï»¿for every type of document. I'm certain that our employees, especially the elder one would make mistakes.
Somehow I came across this feature, called File Screening Management (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732074.aspx). As it claims, it can be used for: "Define file screening templates that can be applied to new volumes or folders and that can be used across an organization". So, partially you can apply a file naming pattern, like "bill-_--_-.*" or so. As far as I can see, it can't check naming with regular expressions, but this is at least something usable.
We have a shared folder on a server, where sales managers ought to save incoming requests, invoices and other documents. Different types of documents separated by folders. Before now managers name files as they like, for example: doc.number_date[dd.mm.yy]_company_name.[ext] or name-company-date[dd.month.yyyy].[ext], etc.
