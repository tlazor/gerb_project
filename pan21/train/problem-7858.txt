I have a desktop I use for development on 10.1.10.123 (outside DHCP range). Is it possible to set it up so all traffic to/from 66.x.x.107 (second static IP) goes to 10.1.10.123?
I think the proper term is NAT 1:1, but I can't seem to find this anywhere in the interface. Closest thing is "Static Routes".
I have a WNR3500L Netgear router. Our ISP is Surewest, and they have provided us 5 static IP addresses (66.x.x.106/110). I have setup the router to use 66.x.x.106 as a static IP, and have setup the DHCP subnet to be 10.1.10.2/100.
what you want to do is introduce a consumer 5 port gig switch to your design.  Plug the switch to the public wire from surewest. then use another port on the switch to go to your NetGear router. This hosts your first IP address (the router does).  Now, take another port on the switch, and connect a wire to it, and the other end to the Computer that you want on the next Public IP you are assigned from Surewest. Configure the PC for the Public IP address #2 on your set of 5 addresses. All traffic will forward to that PC at that address.  Voila. 
A lot of people chose to replace the default operating system on routers like this with a more flexible, open version, like dd-wrt or openwrt. Here is an explanation for how to do it with dd-wrt for example:
(Port forwarding alone isn't enough as we'll have a few machines that all need port 80 for web development testing)
