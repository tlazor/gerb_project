I'm not sure if it's helpful, but I also experienced the Windows Code 5 error for my motherboard when booting.  The solution that ended up working (after trying gujin bootloader, and then trying to swap in a vLite bootloading file into the ISO) was to burn the DVD ISO file as ISO9660 format instead of UDF format.  My Asus P5B motherboard could not boot from a UDF filesystem format.
Boot XP and install Windows 7 from there. (Worked for me. Probably would work if Vista was already installed, instead of XP.)
The WinPE 2.0 (Vista kernel) will; you can use the etfsboot.com file that comes with WinPE 2.0 when creating your ISO with oscdimg in place of the standard one to solve this problem as well
I went through several DVDs until I realized that it could be the file system on the DVD that's preventing bootloading.
What worked for me: I got hard-drive connected to anther PC, here I started instalation with no ther HDDs connected. When Installer prompted for first reboot, I powered it off, reconnected HDD to problem-making PC and started it with DVD in drive. It started and continued installation normally, now PC runs win7 with no problem. Sad is, you need "healthy" PC to run it.
