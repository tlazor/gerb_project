There's not a simple math formula to determine the load you'll be facing.  Your load can change dramatically based on:
Be sure to do load tests targeting 1.5-2 times the load your project teams anticipates. If you handle this load succesfully then I would keep increasing the load so you know what the breaking point is.
I don't think there is any rule of thumb you can apply, except that the only way to know how your application will perform is to watch how your application performs.
There is no silver bullet; and depending on the nature of your application you may see more load with fewer users. For example alot of Ajax on a site can drastically increase the load on Web and DB servers.
There are schools of thought around how to do capacity planning, but it's a lot more complicated than a few formulas.
If you are using IIS and SQL Server, Microsoft makes a few tools for stress testing / capacity testing your websites. IIS Tools 
I have heard that ~75 concurrent users per 1GB RAM and single Core CPU on the web server is a safe estimate. So your typical 8GB / Quad Core Server should handle alot of users. If you get to that point, bandwidth may also start to play a role in your load.
