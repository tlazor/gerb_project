Any tricks you may be familiar with to repair extremely crotchety audio driver situations on Windows 7 before?  I used to yank the driver enum long, long ago to help in such scenarios, but I'm hesitant to do anything like that now post XP.
Now you might hit a problem where you won't sign in properly the first time.  If that happens, you may have to hold the power in and kill the computer.  I then restarted in Safe Mode and upon another restart, the system started up just fine and the issues seem to now be resolved.
I have an interesting situation wherein I updated the audio driver for an Asus X54C and now the audio will no longer work on Windows 7.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled various drivers several times, including ticking the option to delete driver.  The drivers always seem to be installed correctly, but the system always reports that the audio is disabled.  I have, therefore, also pressed the audio disable / enable button on the keyboard (fn-F10) in hopes that it was actually inadvertently disabled by the user, but also to no avail.
Not only did this solve the audio problem, but it also solved some other haunting issues such as the wireless icon in the system tray not showing properly when connecting (even though it was connecting).
