Similarly to how you cannot change the log file size without re-creating the innodb logs, you also cannot re-specify the ibdata file size without re-creating it.  Besides, there is no need to resize it larger since it defaults to an auto-extending file.  Here is the relevant bit of the error that tells you this is a problem:
I've had the same problem on Ubuntu 10.10 (64 bit). Apparently, mysql, at least the one compiled for for this Ubuntu,  does not support buffer_pool_size bigger than 1000M. And ridiculously enough, it event does not complaint about it. So reduce the buffer size, restart the server and see what happens.
SYSCONFDIR represents the directory specified with the --sysconfdir option to configure when MySQL was built. By default, this is the etc directory located under the compiled-in installation directory. This location is used as of MySQL 5.1.10. (From 5.1.10 to 5.1.22, it was read last, after ~/.my.cnf.)
If you are adding a new datapath into my.cnf you may need to edit your apparmour config to permit this change. Do you see any "audit" type errors in your log files?
So I would remove that from my.cnf.  Also you may have a typo somewhere in your config since the error log also says that "innodb_lock_wait_timout" is an invalid variable, but it does not appear to be invalid according to the manual.
It is mysterious though how mysql is running at all when it's clearly aborted during startup due to the invalid my.cnf.
MYSQL_HOME is an environment variable containing the path to the directory in which the server-specific my.cnf file resides.
