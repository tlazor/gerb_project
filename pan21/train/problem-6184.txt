CentOS is essentially Red Hat Enterprise Linux, so we're already in the realm of "distro for production web server".  If you feel CentOS may lag too much behind RHEL, you can look into getting a proper RHEL installation, or one of the other ones.
Nothing much has changed since that last round up. If anything, everything is even more comfortable within a VM than the last time you saw these. 
What's wrong with CentOS?  Since you're already running your existing sites on CentOS, I'd assume you have some institutional knowledge about it.  In the worst case, you'd be upgrading to CentOS 6, but that may be an easier path than learning the configuration details of Debian or Ubuntu LTS, etc.
My only recommendations are to install the bare minimum needed to make it work.  Unless you can't configure your server without a GUI, don't install a desktop.
There are some differences if you're going to be using paravirtualization or OS Zones instead of a full-virtualization solution such as HyperV or VMWare. Because of this, a better question for you to investigate is the effect of these hypervisors on your Webserving environment. VMWare/HyperV are easy to set up, where something like LXC can yield a few percentage points better performance. Only you can judge what is best for your case.
Installing additional components increases the risk of vulnerabilities, and (especially the case of desktop environments) uses up system resources.
