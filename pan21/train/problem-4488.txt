When you get a certificate signed by, say, GoDaddy, the cert then says "I am a valid cert, GoDaddy trusts me". The signer here is called a Certificate Authority (CA)
However, this list can be modified. If you set up your own CA (you trust it), and use that CA to sign a cert, then the cert says "I'm a valid cert, MyCA trusts me". Then you can add your CA to the webbrowser, so it says "I trust MyCA, MyCA vouches for this site, so everything is cool now."
Outlook requires a valid certification path in order for RPC over HTTP to function properly. SSL certs are cheap now-a-days. I'd recommend going down that path.
Your browser has a list of certs that says "I trust these CAs to sign certificates", and one of those is GoDaddy. So, if I trust GoDaddy, and GoDaddy trusts you, then I trust you. However, as a webbrowser, I don't trust just anybody, just this list of CAs.
The problem is that you are using a self-signed SSL certificate. They will always fail SSL Validation tests unless you take specific steps. RPC over HTTPS is sensitive to this. In order to make it work, you will have to import that self-signed SSL certificate into your client machine and make it trusted.
