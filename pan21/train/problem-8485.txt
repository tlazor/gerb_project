Could you also refer to me a good survey of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem in general , one that surveys recent results in this setting ?
I am not sure if these results are known. If you define the $t$-thick upper (or lower, does not matter) shadow of $A_k$ as the sets of one level higher (resp. lower) that contain (resp. are contained in) at least $t$ sets from $A_k$, then what you ask for is the $(k+1)/2$-thick upper shadow. As far as I know it is open to determine the size of the smallest $A_k$ whose $2$-thick shadow is empty. Unfortunately I cannot point you to a reference but I think I heard it from Katona. (And in case I am wrong, then I remember incorrectly...)
Let the majority upper shadow of $A_k$ referred to as $M_u(A_k)$ be the set such that for each $a \in M_u(A_k)$ number of ones in $a = k+1$ and $|N_l(a) \cap A_k| \geq (\frac{k+1}{2})$. That is more than half of a's neighbours are present in $A_k$. Given the size of $A_k$ can we put an upper bound on the size of $M_u(A_k)$. 
Let $A_k \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ be a subset of the hypercube such that every element in $A$ has exactly $k$ ones. For any element $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ let $N_l(x)$ be the set of elements obtained by flipping one of the 1's in x to 0. (Generally referred to as the lower shadow of X) 
Has this problem been studied and are there results are relevant to the above. Note that in case $|A_k| = \binom{n}{k}$ we of course have that $|M_u(A_k)|=\binom{n}{k+1}$. In general I am looking at the size of $A_k$ to be $\epsilon\cdot \binom{n}{k}$ where $\epsilon$ is a small constant. 
I am interested in the following problem which seems like an extension of the Kruskal-Katona Theorem.
