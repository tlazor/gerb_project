There are more possibilities than this, but this gives you a basic guideline of the simple solutions.
If your router supports it, try doing a MAC address clone. If it doesn't, go with MetalMikester's suggestion of checking for a firmware update. If those both fail, and you are confident with your computer's firewall, plug directly into the modem and test the speeds:
One caveat is that some ISP's (Charter does this, for one) will snapshot the MAC address of the first machine to connect to the internet, whether it is a computer or router. This becomes a problem when diagnosing connections, because any other MAC addresses to connect on the line will be shutout from getting a connection. (This happened to my Father-In-Law. Luckily he had a WRT54GL running DD-WRT and was able to clone the MAC of his computer)
*to find your outside address, go to http://whatismyip.org . When plugging your computer in, go to the command line (Start>Run>CMD for Windows, There are many ways for Linux) and type IPCONFIG (for Windows) or ifconfig (for Linux). Find your IP address in there (if it says something like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x, do an IPCONFIG /RENEW in Windows or ifconfig eth0 down, ifconfig eth0 up in Linux) and compare it with the one you found at http://whatismyip.org
