We've got a flat performance requirement tier here so we replace desktops each 4-5 years.  Desktops are inexpensive enough we generally do not add any type of extra warranty - just keep a few spares around.  Laptops are different since they always seem to suffer a performance lag,get the heck beat out of them, and are made up of specialized components.  We carry full 3 year warranties and replace them at the end of that period.
Our office works usually use Citrix. The software runs on a server and each desk just needs a minimal PC as a client. 
Bottom line is:  Business conditions dictate the refresh cycle.  We target 3, but it's typically when we can afford it after 3.
We used to buy our power users (mainly engineers) a desk top work station and a separate laptop from on the road. We then realized a powerful laptop and external monitor (flat screen today) could double as a workstation. We also decided to lease for 3 years. This got us on a good upgrade schedule. After 3 years can either simply send them back or buy out the lease fairly cheap. 
Well, we say three years, basically because that's how we depreciate them.  But we are an IT company, so IRS aside, we'd do new hardware anyway in 3 years for our front-line folks just to be able to reasonably run the latest stuff from Microsoft and Lotus.
We keep ours here for 3 years or until it dies (whichever comes first).  After 3 years, the computer is wiped and sent back to the vendor for a discount on our next purchase.  We rarely change a desktop's owner and if we do, we immediately record it on our asset management.
