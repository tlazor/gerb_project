.AppleDouble files are created to store additional file resources (meta-data, etc.). HFS+ filesystems (designed by Apple) have native means to address the storage of this information. Non-HFS+ filesystems (NTFS, EXT3/4, etc.) served over filesharing (Netatalk, SMB, etc.) require some way to store this information. This is achieved by creating additional files on the filesystem, since the filesystem does not have native means for storing the information.
Unlike .DS_Store files (which, as I understand, store desktop details such as icon location, etc.), .AppleDouble files actually store potentially relevant information. This means that you can probably delete the .AppleDouble files and the OS won't complain, but you may well lose meta-data if any is associated with the file. This also includes meta-data created by/for Spotlight, such as when iTunes plays a file. Deleting this information is unlikely to hurt anything, but it is being created/stored for you so that the OS can optimize search and other terms. 
So my conclusion is that you probably don't actually want to delete .AppleDouble. But perhaps the details can be filled in? I arrived at this thread attempting to help my Dad with two ReadyNAS; he wanted to eliminate the files because their existence was inexplicable and causing strange behavior with the ReadyNAS backup program (which seems to be solved by using rsync). Please let me know if there are further details not addressed in my conclusions here.
