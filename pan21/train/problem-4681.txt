I set up a web server on an internal network, running on CentOS 5.5 with the typical LAMP setup. When I'm in my browser and point it toward http://mailroom/ the webpage comes up no problem. However, when I try to go to a subdirectory, I get the 403 error. So, I tried setting up virtual hosts to point to subdomain.mailroom. When I hit the subdomain, the browser tries to add on a www even though my .htaccess says not to. So my question is...
Note that a 403 error is usually due to misconfigured file/directory permissions. Apache tries to load/serve a file but can't read it. See here for a good list of other things to check related to a 403.
If you want to just do that one server with DNS, you can get away with just making a zone called "mailserver", making the default A record for it go to the actual server, and specify an A record for "subdomain" pointing to the same IP.
You need to set up either a DNS server or a host file for that to work. When you're trying to access the subdomain, the client thinks that "mailroom" is the TLD, and searches the DNS root zones for it.
