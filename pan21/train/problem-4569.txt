The ip command which is part of the the iproute2 package is the new tool.  The link subcommand is for managing the devices/interfaces.
You can read the file /sys/class/net/wlp3s0/statistics/rx_bytes and get the rx_byes directly without calling another command, vnstat is also good.
Linux stores all information in files as I know, so better to find those files and get information. Finding the relevant file is the challenge.
And here I ran into a problem: when run on its own, ifconfig shows the number of bytes received/transmitted on each interface besides other info. I couldn't find a way to get this from ip. Is there no such function in this tool? What other built-in tools could I use for getting those stats?
Since ifconfig is apparently being deprecated in major Linux distributions, I thought I'd learn something about the ip tool that's supposed to be used instead of ifconfig. 
Another option is to use the /proc filesystem. The /proc/net/dev file contains statistics about the configured network interfaces. Each line is dedicated to one network  interface and it contains statistics for receive and transmit. The statistics include metrics such total number of received/transmittted bytes, packets, drops, errors and so on.
