Ruby includes several libraries, part of their standard library (stdlib) that depends on external libraries, like Zlib, OpenSSL, FFI, just to mention a few.
If usage of Visual Studio is really not a requirement, then perhaps you can use RubyInstaller recipes to generate a local package of Ruby 2.1.x:
1) I downloaded zlib128-dll.zip from http://zlib.net and unzipped the contents to a directory (e.g., c:\zlib).
At RubyInstaller, we solved that issue by building the dependencies as packages and using them during Ruby compilation.
In your case, appears you're using Visual Studio, which means you cannot use the binary packages provided by RubyInstaller as the runtime dependencies of those differ.
In order to build Ruby, you need to make those libraries available to Ruby, so it can compile against them.
4) Then from a VS 2012 Native Tools Command Window, I naviagted to C:\ruby-2.1.2\ext\zlib and executed: 
2) Then following some hints from this post (https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/4421852), I created these dirs off of my c:\ruby-build\usr directory:
This tells RubyInstaller recipes to use mingw64 compiler (GCC) 32bits version 4.7.2 and use the local source checkout pointed in LOCAL
