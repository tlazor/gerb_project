I just don't see the purpose of ACK in 3) as there is already an acknowledgement in 2). Also, in older Cisco study materials, the process goes without 2) as well.
An acknowledgement isn't a one-time thing, subsequent packets will all acknowledge the same data if no more has been received (by the end that sends the ACK).  This works in both directions. 
Could someone give me a little insight if all those are possible in certain situations or which one is correct?
I was learning about the process of closing TCP connection and the process differs in many sources I've come across. In official Cisco cert guide (100-105) the process is as follows:
Basically the same thing, what is the extra ACK in packet #38 for? Acknowledgement was already sent in #37. And both also have the same Ack number. 
The ACK flag is set when the acknowledgment number is valid.  It is therefore set on all packets in a TCP flow except for the initial SYN packet, so by the time you are sending FINs, all packets will be ACKs.  You don't need to worry abut it.
