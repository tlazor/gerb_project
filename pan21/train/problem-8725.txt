Say, I have an 128-bits MD5 checksum. And I have a malicious file that is under my control, can a current $5K server generate a "fixer", within a week, that can be appended to the file and yield the same MD5 checksum?
Your $5k can probably buy half a dozen good GPUs, which gives you somewhere in the vicinity of 237 trials per second (about 100 billion). That is roughly 262 per year, so it will take on average about 260 years (about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 aka a quintillion). In more convenient terms, that is about a hundred million times the age of the universe. Your computer probably won't last that long. 
I often hear that MD5 is insecure. But I am not sure how it can be manipulated. I don't want to be the guy who just repeat "MD5 is insecure" without knowing some details.
On the other hand if you have one file pre-specified (usually a 'good' one) and you must find another ('bad') file with the same hash, that is not a collision to cryptographers, it is a second preimage. The best known preimage attack on MD5 is only slightly better than brute force at 2123.4.
The best thing you can do is look at the actual papers in regards to finding MD5 collisions. There are also various tools to do just that. A good answer for this on StackOverflow is Create your own MD5 collisions if you're not interested in reading the paper yourself.
If you, the attacker, get to choose two files that should have the same hash, that's what cryptographers call a collision (attack) and for MD5 it's now very easy. If you can choose both files freely it takes seconds; if you have to satisfy fairly weak but common constraints like 'it looks like a PDF' or 'it looks like a tar' maybe hours to weeks. 
Most collisions finders are probably not interested in finding modifications for files but rather straight on collisions. After all if the MD5 checks out and the users runs the file your malicious file is being run.
