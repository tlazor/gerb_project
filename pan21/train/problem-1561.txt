There's no reason that your data warehouse tables need to even be on the same server, much less tied to the live database with constraints. Deletion shouldn't affect the warehouse. Just have commands that add data.
Based on your stated need to query the entirety of the multimillion (or billion) row table, I expect that you need to do some reporting on from the vendors' database. Here are some potential solutions that I would consider to meet that goal:
I have a large table in MS SQL that I am having issues reading from while a third party application writes to it. My plan to resolve the problem is to move all of the data from one database and delete the data in the source database periodically. The problem arises when the table has too much data ( hundreds of millions of rows), but I need to be able to read all of the data for a rows which could top a billion rows. I don't have the ability to modify the source database because it is third party.
THe standard approahc is to use an ETL script of some kind to make a copy of the data prior to deletion.
There are a number of potential solutions to this problem. Picking the right one is dependent on your environment and your requirements, which aren't flushed out in much detail here.
I'm curious what some options might be to help facilitate this. Is it possible to replicate a table in a way that when I delete the data in the source table, it's not deleted in the destination table?
