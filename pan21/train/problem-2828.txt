What you are looking for is called Server Name Indication, it is an extension to SSL that allows the client it indicate what host it is trying to connect to before the SSL certificate is provided by the server.  See the Wikipedia page for information about what browsers support it, it's somewhat recent (2004-2006), but for example XP doesn't support it.
Yes that is possible. The only thing each SSL certificate needs, is a unique socket (ip:port combination).
If that won't work for you, you will probably either have to require that users specify a different port in the URL, for example https://example.com:444/pagename as suggested by JudasIscariot1651, host all sites SSL sites under a sub-URL off a central certificate (for example https://secure.example.com/sitename.example.com/pagename).
With approach number 2, you'll need a wildcard ssl certificate. Set up any number of vhosts with unique subdomains for the domain your wildcard certificate matches, and configure the SSLEngine settings for just the first. The others will by defualt (or actually by their socket) terminate with the same ssl certificate
Is there a way to have all virtual servers,in Apache, use the same SSL certificate without having multiple IPs? I know that you can use a certificate on one site, per port and per IP, but can I make it work if the sites are on multiple ports?
