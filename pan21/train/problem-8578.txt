The number in the DRx part at the end really does not have any special meaning. It is just a sequence number which starts at 0 and increases ever since. That means it matches the preceding HarddiskX part after boot, but if you plug or unplug some drives, the number keeps increasing and naturally gets out of sync.
Because "disk 4" seems to be the backup disk. Can you correlate the time of the errors to the time of your backup process? If so, then perhaps you can choose to 'not run' the backup for a single night and see if the errors vanish.
I belive it may be that the Harddisk4 maps to "Disk 4" in the Disk Management utility, but I have not found any reference saying that it is so in so many words.
I have intermittent bad block errors in my Windows SBS 2003 system event log.  The error description is The device, \Device\Harddisk4, has a bad block, and I would like to be able to authoritatively say which physical disk that is.  Or in other words, can someone tell me how to authoritatively determine which physical disk a \Device\HarddiskX description refers to?
I have spent some time searching, but the only info I have found is to "look in disk management" but that is not definitive enough for me to say "this disk is faulty".
