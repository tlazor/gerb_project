This said, Apache httpd delivers a nice module named mod_usertrack, which uses cookies to track users on your site. Of course it will only work if users allow cookies from your domain and their web browser supports cookies at all.
As already mentioned in the other answers, you cannot track the users of your website with dead certainty.
Apache logs are best at counting raw traffic. They can be used to track individual sessions if the application that Apache is serving puts some unique identifier (like a session id) in the url. 
The same would be true for any JavaScript-based solution like Google Analytics or Piwik: they only work if the client supports the specific technology (JavaScript, cookies...).
I don't think so, not unless you are having them log in with Apache authentication - in that case, their username would show up in the log file.
The common log format generally shows the remote IP address. For users behind a router or NAT, this will be the address of their router. 
User tracking is difficult at best, and should be done at the application level. Web applications can track individual user actions and correlate them with who is logged in, etc. 
You would see the proxy server's IP because the users are connecting to you through the proxy. Similarly, any group of users NAT'ed on a LAN will appear to come from a single IP.
