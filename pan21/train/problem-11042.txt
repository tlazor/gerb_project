In order to use the standard ssh-agent, just make sure it's running and then add your private key to the current session using ssh-add.
You need an SSH agent for this to work. The SSH agent can store your private keys. You can then unlock a key once when you log in, and keep using that key without a password throughout the rest of your session.
I want to use my vim config when editing files, but there are at least 5 different servers right now where I have to edit them. Of course I could use console (where I set up ssh-keys and and have a script so it wont asks for passhphrase), but then I have to maintain the vim config on every machine. so I decided to use gvim and browse/edit the remote machines via scp://, but on every action a popup appears asking for the passphrase. 
You could use sshfs and map remote file trees this way. Then treat them as regular files which are part of your local root filesystem.
this is a ubuntu 10.10  install, with xfce installed later on. i checked in the xfce settings so gnome services should start, but it still won't remember the passphrase.
