1- install the oracle binaries and patch them to the same level as the live instance without create a database on the stby1's host server
5- Make sure the listener.ora and tnsnames.ora files are configured correctly on both prd1 and stby1
Here are the steps I follow when creating a standby for a dataguard environment on windows server, please confirm in comments at which step you currently are to help identify your issue here.
2- On the prd1 instance create a control file for the standby ALTER DATABASE CREATE STANDBY CONTROLFILE AS  'D:\CONTROL01.CTL';
As part of data guard configuration, I've installed standby database using Oracle Software only and configured .ora files/folders as required. But while trying to start the listener or check the status in standby, it's throwing the following error. 
8- Once you got all the above settings figured out you go on the stby1 instance and recover the database using SQLPLUS
As I'm doing this for the first time, I'm very much confused at this stage. How can I resolve this?
