Yes, it's quite important to use the T568A (or B) wiring schemes for reliable ethernet performance.  Unshielded Twisted Pair cables are only able to reliably carry high-speed signals at full-duplex for distances up to 100 m when specific wires are selected:  For 100BASE-TX, The four wires that are not transmitting signals are just as important as the four that are:  They serve as shielding to prevent cross-talk, interference. echos, and fade.  For 1000BASE-T*, all four pairs are used, but it's still important to separate wires carrying certain signals from others that might be carrying signals that would create destructive or constructive interference on neighbouring wires.
For short cables, at lower line rates, it's quite possible to 'get away' with non-standard wiring, but as distances approach the specification limits, and the fastest line rates, selecting the proper pairs to send, receive, and dampen signals becomes more critical.
So, if you're not using one of the specified cabling pinouts, then your connection will be unreliable.  This may manifest in intermittent connectivity, one-way transmission problems, pattern sensitivity, etc.
