This will setup a tunnel and will let you connect in 3minutes. If you connect it will be available until it becames idle. This will not kill a running backup process however (I hope this is what you want).
I'm setting up some background SSH tunnel for some backup procedures. However I'm worried the ssh process just sitting around. At the end of my script I kill the PID, but what if something happens to my script and it doesn't finish. I want something that's a bit more robust.
The expect package has the timeout command as one of its examples. You could wrap your whole script with a call to that.
Another way of doing this would be setting the idle-timeout value on your session.  This can be done on the server in the sshd_config with the "IdleTimeout" value, or by the user in the authorized_keys file as an "idle-timeout=6m ...key...".  Or hours.  Or seconds.  Section 8.2.7 in oreilly's "SSSH The Secure Shell" book.  After said amount of inactivity (no input), your processes will be killed.  How clean that is depends on how well they respond to hups :)
