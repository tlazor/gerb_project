Looks like you are becoming part of the corporate network (or whatever network you are connecting thru vpn) and you might have to use their proxy in ur browser to be able to browse.
I had a similar problem where I could not see my network printer at home once I VPN'd in until split tunneling was enabled.
There is often a setting within the client to only send traffic destined for that particular network over the VPN connection, but this is called split-tunelling, and is considered a security risk.  The problem is that an attacker could gain access to your computer over your regular connection (virus/backdoor/etc), and they would now have access to your corporate network via the VPN - effectively bypassing any security your corporate network has put in place. 
What sounds like is happening is when you connect to the VPN Host they do not have this option enabled, therefore you use their resources for everything. If you want to surf the web it would be off their connection, ISP, IP Addresses etc. If they have locked this down you would not be able to do so.
The best solution is to run your VPN session, and associated work, inside of a virtual machine (VMWare, Virtual Box, or whatever you choose) so that only that box's network is impacted.
