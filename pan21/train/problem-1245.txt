When you write the code bellow, it renders a percentage of an image's predefined alpha value (which you define in unity's inspector - for example if you define the alpha value of an image to 100, the code bellow actually makes it 25, when the scene is being rendered)
Instead, you should edit the alpha attached to the Image. This is fairly simple to do, but you need to remember that you are using UnityEngine.UI.Image. You will need to include the using UnityEngine.UI namespace, or write the complete address.
From there, it is as simple as retrieving the Color and changing the a value. Note that you actually have to retrieve the Color, as shown in the code below, as you can not directly change Color.a from another script.
Your wanting to edit the alpha of an Image, but your attempting to change the alpha on the CanvasRenderer. This value only multiplies the alpha value of the image, resulting in the behaviour you describe.
You can see this method in action, below. For testing purposes, I attached the method to the editor, and used it to submit values of 0 and 255. While the Image does not actually have an image attached to it, you can still clearly see the change in the Color value.
