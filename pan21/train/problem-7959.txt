This is made slightly worse if you install the 64 bit version of an OS. Binaries (programs) for 64 bit aplications tend to be larger and consume more memory. This is usually not a bad thing since any modern system will ship with 8GiB or more. But if you try to use a modern 64 bit OS on an ancient computer then you run into problems.
In your case the OS and applications use up most of the available memory. Adding a large page file can help a bit because it allows windows to page out unused parts, thus leaving more available for your firefox and ppt applications. But this is merely a workaround. The real solution is to add more memory (assuming the old system supports it and that it is affordable), or to run the applications elsewhere and just use the local desktop as a terminal.  (E.g. see Citrix, windows server etc etc). The latter does imply having a more modern computer elsewhere, which might not be the case at home.
Your problem is insufficient memory. Early versions of windows XP ran fine on 64MiB or 128MiB (that is, the OS with allmost no applications open). UP to date versions of XP with a modern browser really want 512MiB or more. And a modern firefox easily consumers a few hundred MiB. So 1GiB (1024MiB) worked.
Bow you moved to windows 7. Windows 7 assumed more memory and it even specified at least 1GiB for win7 32bit and win 7 64 bit. This does not mean that you cannot use win 7 x64 with less memory, but if you do it is likely to behave badly. Or it might just run the OS and have almost no reserves for applications.
