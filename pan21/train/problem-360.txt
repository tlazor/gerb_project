SSDs use different data blocks than mechanical drives, you will find that when you clone a mechanical drive image onto SSD the data blocks will not be optimal.
You need to undergo a "SSD aligning process" detailed here http://lifehacker.com/5837769/make-sure-your-partitions-are-correctly-aligned-for-optimal-solid-state-drive-performance
I just did this very thing on my Lenovo Tablet over the weekend, went off without a hitch; My SSD drive was also smaller than my original. I used an old version of Ghost that is on my Hiren Boot Cd and did a simple drive to drive copy.
Make no mistaken this isn't just a tweak that gives 0.5% boost in performance, this is actually very significant and there are resounding benchmarks that show a stark contrast in performance between a properly aligned SSD and an incorrectly aligned SSD.
what the other guys have said, in addition to that you will have to tweak your hard drive a little in order to make it work effectively.
I already did that with clonezila, the only problem is if your ssd have less capacity of space then your HDD clonezila will not recover the image (maybe any image manager can do it if you try to recover a large partition on a short space hard disk). The solution for this problem is resize your partition for the space that your SSD provides.
Disk-to-disk or image copying may require you to match the partition size of the HD to fit on the SSD. You could use a tool like ""GParted" http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
