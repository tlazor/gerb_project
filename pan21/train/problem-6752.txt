Next I went and manually changed the IP address and netmask of one of the interfaces on the server using ifconfig eth0 <laptopIP + 1> netmask <laptop_subnet> so that it falls under the same subnet as my laptop is. I then tried to ssh using ssh ssh username@LaptopIP+1 -p 2220 and I get 
or if you want to stick with the alternative port, modify the above command to allow 2220(changing the default port is of course recommended if this is a production or "public" server). Once you've allowed the port, check the status of ufw again to be sure, then try connecting remotely via ssh.

I have a linux server running Ubuntu 16.04. I installed the ssh-server on it and have it running with the sudo ssh service start and can see it with ps aux | grep ssh. I want to ssh into it from my laptop (also running Ubuntu 16.04). They are both connected to the same Wifi. When I ssh from my laptop to the server using ssh username@serverIP, I get 
This is very likely the firewall blocking the connection. You should have a look to see what your firewall policies are with the sudo ufw status command. You may get output that looks similar to this(but likely fewer ports open):
Since some of the recommendations here was to use another port number and not 22, I changed the port to 2220 in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file on the server. I then ssh from my laptop using ssh username@serverIP -p 2220 and I get the same connection refused error.
Here is one reference: https://askubuntu.com/questions/9206/is-there-a-preinstalled-or-automatic-firewall 
This will especially be true if you change your port to something other than the default 22. You can allow connections on a specific port by using that same command:
