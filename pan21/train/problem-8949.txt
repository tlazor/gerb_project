In Fedora, you could use Compiz to make it transparent (Video tutorial on how to do just that here.) In both Fedora and Windows, what about setting a transparent image as the background?
I'm afraid it's not possible. However, Java 7 which is expected as of July 28th, 2011 has support for translucent windows. After that, Eclipse is community effort... your best bet is to either to participate in development, or consider programming Eclipse plugin (or find someone interested in progamming plugin).
SWT uses a class Shell that is the actual window, creating a Shell with the flag NO_TRIM will cause it to have transparent background. As this window is created by the Eclipse platform I doubt that it is possible to access it via a plugin.
You could use compiz in Ubuntu, and most other linux distributions for making the windows transparent.
If you feel like building a plugin translucent support could probably be achieved by accessing functions in the native toolkit directly (either the WIN32 API or the GTK API) and applying them to the Eclipse components. As I have limited knowledge of Eclipse plugins I can't direct you to any particular starting place for creating such a plugin. Sorry.
Eclipse uses SWT as its windowing toolkit, and if I remember correctly it has limited support for transparent and translucent windows. This support is probably limited to the entire window and not parts of it.
