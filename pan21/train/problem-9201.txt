I get back "start port 1025, Number of Ports 64510" on the systems using low ports and "Start port 49152, Number of ports 16384" on regular systems.

More than likely the default port range for your system has been altered from the standard 49152-65535 to the larger 1025-65535. This is done sometimes when certain applications are installed such as Microsoft Exchange or SQL Server.

Your only chance is disabling the SSDP service on the server.  Note that you will lose functionality such as UPnP if you do this.
They give commands to change the ports, though I don't know if there are consequences to changing it back when one of the special applications are running:
For me, it seems to be related to SQL server. My guess is that systems with some enterprise grade software (exchange, SQL, etc.), the default port range gets increased from the standard 49152-65535 to a larger range (1025-60000?)
Our custom windows application listens on port 5000. After a regular reboot, our application could no longer listen on port 5000, since lsass.exe (Local Security Authentication Server) wich runs as a Windows Service already started listening on 5000. Is there a way to instruct lsass.exe not to use port 5000? Are there any other alternatives?
