Yes, this run's it every hour, but there is a lock-file in the script, so if the previous run didn't finish, the new run of the script will quit immediately without doing anything.
I have a cron job running a script which takes about 6 hours to finish. The problem is that cron is not mailing me the output of that job, and I would like it to.
As a debug tool: run from cron a series of scripts that just print a date, print their name, intended lenght of sleep, sleep for n minutes, print a date, and then quit. I would run them all at the same time, to have answer in 7 hours. If you test sleep times of length from 1h to 7 hours with, let's say, 10 mins increment, you'll know if it's a general time-out issue, or something to do just with your script.
If the job is killed (with "kill $PID") early during its run, then I do get an e-mail with the output of the job. Also if I modify the script to do 10 times less stuff, then I also do get an e-mail. Its only if the script is running for some hours I do not get an e-mail at all.
So it seems that the MTA is already called when the cron job starts, not when it finishes. Can that be related to the problem? Might it be possible that Postfix doesn't like postdrop running so long, and it times-out or something? How can I solve the issue - I need to have the output e-mailed to me.
