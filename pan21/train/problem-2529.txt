Great question! I can appreciate that you have a base of statistics to work from. Most data scientists - especially the ones that go to these data "camps" or whatever - out there do not have this and it should serve you well in your career. Here are some answers to your questions, in order:
I think that your base of already working around experiments and (presumably) applying the scientific method will serve you well and already puts you ahead of most data scientists out there. Now, it's just a matter of being able to do all of that with code and, if you follow the steps above, I think you will see those connections and how you can enter the world of data science.
I'd recommend you read Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James. Be sure to check Introduction to Machine Learning by Andre Ng on Coursera. Really gives good sense to what data science is all about. Pick R or Python, check out Kaggle.com and you will have a better sense what should you do next 
Depending on what kind of data scientist you want to be, you may be ready to just start applying for jobs like crazy. The data science R&D group that I work in (at a fortune 5 company) tends to value critical thinking skills with a technical background more than any ability to program in a certain language or the ability to implement any single model. 
This depends on the Data Science position, but in the industry there is a big focus on gathering good data, as opposed to tweaking the algorithm. Generally simpler models are used in the industry. Often Data Scientist is client (or stakeholder) facing because they are the best person to know what data they need. They also are the best person to talk about the results. Make sure to consider this angle.
