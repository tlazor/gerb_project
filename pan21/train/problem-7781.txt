Assume that something goes wrong a few days after all of these servers get put into production.  Let's say a Windows security update gets installed on domain controllers, or the organizations routers get patched, or some new security software gets pushed out to every server.  Suddenly, your SQL Servers stop working because they get login failures.  You may not know about the change in the environment.  If you went with scenario #1, you're going to have zero, or much less, anxiety that the installation/setup process was the cause of the issue.
If you used scenario #2, you are going to have more anxiety that you missed something, screwed something up, etc.  I would, anyway.  Some people wouldn't, but I think I lot of us would have a bit of panic.  Additionally, would other people in the project possibly start pointing out the post-install service account change if there was an outage of this nature?  Regardless of whether it is a reasonable concern, someone may start questioning anything that is out-of-the-ordinary.
Although it is going to be a bit of a pain to go back and change all of them, even if it can be done with scripts, there is one factor that I would consider beyond all of the technical stuff that can obviously be addressed: Anxiety.
So if it's a server or two and an outage isn't going to cause you any anxiety--no big deal.  But if an outage is going to cause anxiety, I would stick with scenario #1 if possible.
