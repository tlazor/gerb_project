I have also run some other hard drive test provided by Sony's Vaio Care and a CPU test by Sony. All of these have passed without errors.
I haven't installed any 3rd party drivers. All the drivers have been there by default or updated via Sony's program called Vaio Update. 
I did notice some Win 8 Home Premium versions on torrent sites pre Win 8 release last year, these were fake, edited Beta releases.
Any ideas? Is there something I could try myself before sending it back to Sony and waiting for a replacement for a month?
Some 3rd party troubleshooting software is not quite Windows 8 ready and may give you false positives.
I recently purchased a Sony Vaio Pro with i7-4500u, 8 GB memory and a 256 GB SSD. It had Windows 8 Home Premium preinstalled.
Other than that, running Windows Updates (Windows key + R, type 'wuapp') until there are no updates should resolve any issues.
If your device is new and still under warranty, do not go installing any 3rd party software as it may invalidate the warranty and leave you stranded.
You could try going to the 'Device Manager' (Windows key + X), selecting your device, click refresh, troubleshoot and/or update any device drivers that have any warnings.
It has failed with error code NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM twice and once with MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, PFN_LIST_CORRUPT, DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION and IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. All of these errors seems to be related to different problems according to search results.
