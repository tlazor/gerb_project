I appreciate the desire to know about historical origins, but it is very important to appreciate that this is a nuanced topic and you cannot always find simple answers. Often, we do not even know when or why a concept was developed.
Regarding your last paragraph, the historical origins are, in my opinion, not a good source of motivation for or understanding about the essence of computation. In fact, they are a pretty bad source for undergrads. There are many contemporary essays, books, talks and the like about why computation is important, universal, beautiful, fascinating, and deep. That's where you should be looking. Here are a few random starting points in no particular order.
Historical motivation and precedence is not usually required to communicate the current understanding of the concepts or even their current relevance. Moreover, historical and philosophical issues are often subtle and doing them academic justice requires time and training that is not usually part of a computer science curriculum. 
There are different questions being asked here. It is important to keep in mind that most courses on this topic are designed to clearly communicate and deepen a student's understanding of the concept of computation.
