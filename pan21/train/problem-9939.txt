More than likely anyway that you export a virtual machine to a physical machine, you're going to end having to reactivate it. One, the system will notice that the hardware is different (motherboard, harddrive, RAM, processor, videocard). Two, you going to find that Windows will need to find drivers for any specific hardware that is installed on the machine (video, NIC, sound, etc).  Last, if you reactivate windows on the new hardware, your licenese for the OS will not allow you to keep the virtual up and running also. It's a grey area, but typicaly you can only have one instance of the OS running at a time (though I doubt that the EULA police will raid your home for this). Just remember that.
Is it possible to export the .vdi virtual hard drive to a real, physical hard drive, to put into a real, physical computer?
I have a Windows 7 VM on my Mac OS X VirtualBox Host. The virtual drive is a dynamically-expanding with a limit of 20GB.
I have an external case to mount an IDE drive to USB, and can pass that through to VB, but just copying all the files on the virtual drive won't copy things like boot sectors.
