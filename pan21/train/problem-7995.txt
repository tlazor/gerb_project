Without return_sequence=True, Input shape from [batch_size,sequence_length,previous_hidden_dim] to [batch_size,hidden_dim]
In case of any doubt on my explanation, please read the material I give you below. You can verify my description by calling model.summary().
Input shape from [batch_size,sequence_length,previous_hidden_dim] to [batch_size,sequence_length,hidden_dim]
Each cell/timestep will actually produce a hidden state representation. However, this is surpressed by default on keras. You can re. As LSTM without Bidirectional wrapper produce a one-way sweep through your sequence, your output from LSTM(5) is the hidden state of the final LSTM cell(cell output not cell state). 
What you are referring as "folding" of LSTM is actually iautomatically based on sequence length of previous input.
Now to enable outputting the sequence of hidden output similar to what you might have learned about LSTM, simply supply return_sequence=True.
So basically what led to your confusion is due to keras LSTM default behaviour of only outputting the final cell output.
