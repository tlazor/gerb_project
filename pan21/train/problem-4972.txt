Some rules set values to what should be the default values - e.g. margin: 0 for the unordered list and list items, and cursor: pointer for the anchors. Those shouldn't be needed unless there are other styles matching the selectors that would add different values - e.g. for other page contents or a browser/plugin stylesheet
It appears that the on-click class is only utilized in the last selector (i.e. .dropdown .dropdown-trigger.on-click.active + .dropdown-menu) but that class name could be removed since it doesn't appear to be used anywhere else
Generally document.getElementsByClassName will be quicker than document.querySelectorAll (see this post for more information) and the former also returns a live HTMLCollection so it wouldn't need to be queried each time. Bearing in mind that deactivateAllDropdownTriggers() looks for elements with both class names dropdown-trigger and active, only the latter is really needed. If active applies to other elements, then perhaps a name like active-dropdown would help narrow down elements. In order to iterate over the items in that collection, they would need to be put into an array - that can be done with the spread operator ...
