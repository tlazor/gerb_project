I work mainly with with Linux based servers and Sugarcrm. One of my clients has deployed his suagrcrm instance on a windows server. SugarCrm is a php application that I would normally run under a LAMP stack but can work with MS SQL etc. 
Anyway the problem is that in the Sugarcrm instance there is an invoicing module that contains itemised lines. But some how the server is preventing the user from saving any more than 47 line items in a single save. This does not happen under Linux so there must be a limit on the server somewhere that limiting the POST data or query string length. Or it could be MS SQL. There are no errors showing anywhere in the logs and I have increased all the settings in the php.ini file so it cant be a php problem. 
If you are concerned that POST data might be too big for the server setting you can increase it in your web.config.  You can see full request limit documentation here.
Are you able to capture the request headers for one of these requests and do you have the exact HTTP response code?
