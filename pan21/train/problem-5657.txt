Note that if both computers have two connections, both will have an IP address on each network.  If you find that they're still trying to use wireless to communicate with each other, you might need to manually update your hosts file with the wired address of the other computer.  That means you'll need a static address, but it won't rely on DNS to resolve addresses.  Windows routes the traffic based on the IP.
Finally, on your computer with two connections, make sure that the wireless adapter is the LOWEST in the precedence order (so it always gets searched last to resolve addresses).
You should now have a scenario where your computer can be connected to both networks and will auto-select the one that has the resource it's looking for (that is, Internet traffic will go via wireless, and internal connectivity will use the wired connection).
For your base (wired) router, you need to disable its routing functionality.  Turn it into basically a dumb switch -- no DHCP, no NAT, no port forwarding, etc.
For the wired connection on each computer, set up a static IP address, or you can just leave it at DHCP and let each computer auto-assign an address in the 169.254.x.x range.  In the DNS address box, use the IP address of your wireless router.  Make sure there is no default gateway set (if using an auto-assigned address there won't be one).
