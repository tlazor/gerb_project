3.The last and the hardest one for me, when I execute pwmWrite(18, 25)" on PWM. pin 18 triggers the same instruction onto PWM. pin 12, which means pwmWrite(18, 25) triggers pwmWrite(12, 25). To solve this situation, changing the modes of other pins of servos which should freeze without any moving to be input mode and set all of them to be pull-down.
Hello I want to use 2 servo with different gpio pins. But Raspberry has one hardware pwm (GPIO 18). first of all I tried another pin to run servo and my code:
Lucky to see this question, I just spent weeks on controlling two servo (SG90) using WiringPi and programming in C, there're three things that I recommend.
I googled my problem and I found a solution such using softpwm. But when I write these codes my servos are shaking not turning. 
2.Better make sure there is only one program access PWM. pins at one time. Based on my experience, if you find that using command like "gpio -g pwm 18 25" is workable but otherwise using code like "pwmWrite(18, 25)" doesn's get any servo responds, maybe try "ps -A" to make sure if any other program is racing the access of your servo.
1.Using BCM GPIO instead of WiringPi Pin because controlling more than one servo, you might need more than one pin such like 1(WiringPi Pin)/18(BCM GPIO) for another servo, For RPi3 B+ version, it give access to two channels for hardware PWM. Channel 0 on gpios 12/18 and channel 1 on gpios 13/19, it's easy and no need to worry about pin mapping exists if you adpopt BCM GPIO.
