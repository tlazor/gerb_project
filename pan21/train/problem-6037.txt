Regarding the performance, it might be worthwhile to use bonnie++ to test the speed of file creation and deletion.  Out of curiosity I tested doing 2 million create/deletes, once on a linode VPS and another on a supermicro box with an LSI Megaraid with a 6 disk raid10 in it.  Here is the VPS:
Simfs is pseudo FS. Actually your files can be on anything ranging from EXT3 to you-name-it. My bet is EXT3 :) And it's very likely there're other processes (of other OpenVZ containers) I/O'ing on the same hard drive.
I use Debian 6, but tried CentOs 5.5 and Debian 5 as well. Is this normal behavior of OpenVZ VPS's? Are there any possible tweaks or other ways of deleting files faster than rm -rf?
If you have a data set that you delete regularly it is sometimes faster to put it on a different partition and then unmount+mkfs that partition.  Depending on the number of files that will be considerably faster than rm -rf.  
No, there is no general way of deleting that is faster than rm.  The performance level you see isn't caused by OpenVZ per se, but is more likely caused by the OpenVZ host being overloaded.  That is all too common for Virtuozzo-based hosting providers, because there aren't hard limits on any resource, they tend to be run with far too many customers on one server and performance suffers.  That's why they're so cheap.
I recently bought OpenVZ VPS and compared to a dedicated servers rm -rfoperation takes considerably  longer to complete (about 4x - 5x longer). This is case even if there is one big file as opposed to many small files in directory. The server have it's own dedicated hard drive and is otherwise very fast on other tasks. Filesystem type is simfs
