Several of the files – which were previously reported as corrupt – I randomly checked, and they now "seem" to be OK. (Meaning I was able to copy them and play them – most of our data is video files.)
At this point, someone on the FreeNAS forums said, "You're screwed, at some point you had 2 disks fail, bye bye data."
What I'd like to do is COPY everything for which we do not have a backup, and which is not corrupt, to another machine, and then upgrade this one to RAIDZ2.
I'm using FreeNAS-8.0.4-RELEASE-p2-x64 (11367) on a box with 5x3TB SATA disks configured as a raidz volume.
I'm thinking maybe what happened is that 2 drives became dislodged. I think the hotswap bay we have is poor quality.
We don't have a backup for ALL the data ... so we need to figure out which of those files are corrupt, and which are usable.
Went to console and view disks, it just said "loading" forever *couldn't get to the "Replace" option!
I clicked the 'scrub' button ... zpool status showed "resilver in progress .... 900h to go" ... which is like a month...
