Nevertheless, the conversation -- or tree -- view seems not to work perfectly here with my TB 3.0.1.
When you create it, just choose the inbox and the "sent" folder and say "no conditions" (or corresponding, I'm German).
You might want to install the companion extension called "Gmail Conversation View" (cannot post more than 1 hyperlink) (full disclosure: I'm the author).
Menu entry "Edit / Account settings...", tab "Copies & Folder",  then "When sending messages, automatically...".
By default it selects the current folder, so if when sending or replying to e-mails from your inbox it will choose that folder.
I don't know whether it works with Thunderbird 3 or not - I haven't thought about upgrading yet (but as it's now at 3.0.1 I might).
I'm still using Thunderbird 2.0.0.23 and the "Copy Sent to Current" extension which gives you the option of choosing the folder sent items get saved to.
