Once you have your DNS entries correct you will need to change your nameservers to point to the server you are setting up with your registrar. Until then however you can test your settings using dig.
www not going to work if you don't have a record for elfoip.net as well. You need an A record or if you are going to send it to a different domain you can use another CNAME.    
Also note that the RFC says that you should have between two and five nameservers and they should be as separated as possible (different networks, different continents, different service providers, etc.) to improve their availability.  You can take this with a grain of salt but running just one nameserver on a single VPS is likely to cause more downtime than a more widely distributed setup.
You need to add a . to the end of a fqdn in dns. So make it. Also you need to add an A record so bind knows what the elfoip.net ip is supposed to be 
Your current config has NS records but the targets of those NS records don't have A records. This type of error may end up working for some people (who just use the glue IPs) and fail for others who only use the glue to find the authoritative servers.
Obviously please replace 127.0.0.1 with your real IP. You will notice that this entry has no prefix which tells DNS that this is an entry for the main domain elfoip.net.
Without the period at the end bind makes the host www.elfoip.net.elfoip.net So the . terminates the hostname so it stops at www.elfoip.net
