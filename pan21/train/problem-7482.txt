If you do have a modem/router provided by them, they can take it a step further. They can see how many other host devices that have been connected, what their computer or device names are, which ones are currently connected, as well as the local IP of said devices. 
Now keep in mind this is accessible to just the Front-Line call center agents. People who are in the Central Office almost certainly have additional tools or privileges where they could grab more information.
All Tech Support agents had a tool that can see the entire network from the Central Office all the way into your home. They can also see if you have a proprietary modem/router with reasonable accuracy(90%+). 
I am almost certain there is something in the firmware authenticates with the Central Office that verifies if you are using the correct modem. I highly doubt you will be able to fool them and you may just have to suck it up and buy a supported modem. 
I used to do tech support and train new hires for an ISP that provided DSL and Fiber connections, so this may vary a bit, but the principle should be the same.
