If you get an email that does requrie attention, if you can deal with it quickly, do so. Right now, immediately. Then you can delete it.
Sometimes you get emails you might need later, but don't care about right now. Move it to a folder and forget about it.
I think it is aimed at people who get above a certain level of emails per day - for those like me who only get a few messages, it's overkill.
I still have nearly 300 emails in my 'todo' inbox, but you should see my deleted folder. If I didn't deal with them as above, I'd be even more swamped.
I get tons of emails daily on the current project, if thee's any email thet gets sent that I know, or there's a reply later that includes the previous email - it goes to trash. Similarly, any that I read and think "yep, that's not my problem" goes to trash. If its important they can send it again :)
One feature I rely on with MacOSX Mail that hasn't been mentioned yet is Smart Folders. You can use such criteria as date sent, address group, priority, etc. to filter mail automatically wherever it is and have an "important" smart folder to pay more attention to than a bloated "inbox".
Also, gmail has a nifty alias feature you could use to sign up for low priority things like mailing lists, online shopping, etc, and easily filter them. Or, conversely, you can give out a high-priority email addressâ€¦
Best thing I have found is to keep on top of it. Check your email constantly when you are able and deal with it now rather then at the end of the day when you have a hundred or so to read through.
