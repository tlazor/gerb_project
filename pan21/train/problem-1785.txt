After a call to MS support, we managed to get this one resolved.  I don't know if this is something others will run into, but for some reason a VERY old version of the Microsoft.SharePoint.ApplicationPages.dll was loaded into the GAC on the server.

We could not come up with a reason for why that DLL was in the GAC, but the server had been around since January of 2007.
