I use a two-fold strategy:  #1 is LVM snapshots  and number two is rsnapshot, which I use to make point-in-time backups to a dedicated external hard disk drive.  The external hard disk drive is placed so that I can easily yank it on my way out the door should something bad happen.  I don't (yet) use an off-site mechanism other than periodically burning a snapshot to a series of encrypted DVD discs and shipping them to a friend's place in another city for storage.
Here's the full steps for another method, works for moving from one hard drive to another, and even cloning a machine if the hardware is similar.
Boot the machine you want the image deployed on with a live cd/gentoo cd. Mount that hard drive and partition it appropriately:
I highly recommend rsnapshot because of the way it does the snapshots, using hard links for things that haven't changed.  If your home directory goes bonkers, you can just take an rsnapshot copy and tarpipe or rsync it back to your new home partition after reinstalling or recovering from drive failure.
I'm too spoiled by Windows utilities that take a digital snapshot of your entire drive, which you can then restore from in the event of a drive crash.  (e.g. like Time Machine for Mac OS X).
Several.  There's the old fashioned dd(1), which is kind of arcane; there's dump(8) and restore(8); there are several open-source products around, like Amanda; and if you want, you can install ZFS and use a cron script to take periodic snapshots, giving you something effectively identical to Time Machine (see Tim Foster's weblog.)
