Try subversion Edge. Also if you want to access your version controlling server remotely, then you need a public IP and the port to the subversion server should be forwarded. or you can use the free Git repository
I used google code with SVN, and then later switched to HG. Never had any problems until my employer started blocking https through the proxy.
Amidst my busy schedule at work, I occasionally find some time to study/code/work on my pet ASP.net projects (most of them exploring new concepts/designs). And  I do that @ home too, during weekends/evenings/free time. One major difficulty I found was that I am starting to maintain 2 code bases (one in office, one at home). Am behind a proxy @ work and behind a wireless router at home (the ISP gives me a dynamic IP I believe). And at both places, I have WinXP. Is there a way I can configure any source control (hopefully open source, and may be subversion, as I know to use it). I can access my machine at home from work  using TeamViewer, so can find my IP/change settings etc. Is there a way to configure subversion at my home computer so that  I can access it from work ?
Sorry for off-topic, but are you aware that if your pet project will eventually grow into something useful, your employer can claim ownership of it (because you are using his time and resources)?
