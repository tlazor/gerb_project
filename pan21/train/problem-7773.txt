I tried Hotkey Commander to see if a program was intercepting those as Windows hotkeys, but it is not the case.  Also, I should mention that if I plug in an external keyboard, Alt-X does work correctly.
The laptop keyboard is some type of "international" keyboard with a few weird symbols on some keys, but it is basically just a normal US keyboard.  I played around with the Windows language and keyboard layouts, but it did not help.
I found the webpage for the drivers for my laptop, but it does not seem to have a driver for the keyboard.  In the device manager, the keyboard is listed as Standard PS/2 Keyboard.  I have the latest bios.
I had posted this question earlier and it was marked as duplicate since it seemed I just asking how to find the active hotkeys.  I am also askingn for help on the Toshiba forum.
I got a new laptop (Toshiba S50-B-020, Windows 8.1) and the keyboard is 99.9% fine, except that it does nothing when I type Alt-Z, Alt-X or Alt-C.  The Alt key works with all other combinations that I tested, the Z, X and C keys work normally when not used with Alt.
I followed one suggestion from Toshiba and removed the keyboard from the device manager and rebooted, but it did not help.  Another solution is to re-install Windows, but that is a pain and I'm not sure if the keyboard ever worked correctly.  I cannot use a restore point since that was not activated.
