I am trying to transfer a 6 GB file from one computer to another - I tried doing just a normal copy onto my external hard drive, but apparently FAT32 doesn't support files that large. Both computers are running Ubuntu Linux, and they're on the same home network.
Alternatively if you don't want to do this or reformat / partition, as alpha1 said, split it into smaller chunks using a zip program, it should work well. However 7zip is windows only, I cannot advise one zip over another on Linux but I quickly found p7zip which looks like a *nix command line version of 7zip.
It's a simple problem with probably an easy answer, but I was curious if anyone had any particularly elegant or insightful solutions.
Personally, I don't always have a lot of luck with anything other than standard Linux networking. When I need to transfer large files, I always end up installing a FTP server (usually there are tons to choose from within an available respository / apt-get) then just share the folder and transfer.
It actually may not be as fast (unless GB networking) however once you have set this up, it is available to use every time and it works very well
Just use SCP, which will transfer them over SSH. SSH is on by default on Ubuntu machines I believe (unless something has changed in the last few versions)
Split the file into various tar/rar archives that can be recombined? (this was my first attempt but totally failed with command line tar syntax since I suck at reading man pages).
