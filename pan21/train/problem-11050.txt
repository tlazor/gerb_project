I'm not really an expert with Windows by any stretch, but it does sound like caching of some sort or your repository is quite large so the necessary indexes to operate it efficiently classify as "chunky" :)  Is there a way, like with Linux, to see how memory is allocated/used on a per-process basis, perhaps through Task Manager or the Resource Monitor?
You probably want to establish how long exactly it is taking to get to this level of memory use. Is it purely a matter of time, or can you accelerate the process by performing more commits, or doing more check-outs etc. Memory leaks are rare but possible and generally result in performance problems. These problems will manifest them at different points for different configurations. Is the repository slower after it reaches 200MB?
In most cases memory is not 'wasted'. It is the job of the operating system to manage memory allocations overall, but some applications may have their own strategy. In this case, SVN may have a cache, but it could also be allocating more memory so that it is a contiguous allocation of memory. Generally the OS should see memory pressure and use a range of heuristics to ensure other applications continue to function normally.
That#s interesting - I havn't heard of a large memory usage of Svnserve on the mailing lists, perhaps you'd like to post there.
Edit: This should really be a comment to your question, but comments seem to utterly mangle all formatting and I really wanted bullet points for the questions. :-)
