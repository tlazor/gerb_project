The SIP client program doesn't have to have any other audio or calling features - we all have hardware SIP phones on our desks as well.
Or if you wish a ready to use solution you might try the mizu webphone which has a setting for this, so you just have to enter your URL to be called on incoming calls.
I don't know how call queue works with your PABX (sequential or all-at-once ringing), but opening pages automatically may result with lots of pages opened unnecessary (or be very disturbing if agents are making notes after the call) and I think in many cases agents may know that particular call should be left to be answered by their peers.
Recently I've added options to automatically open URL on incoming call or on accepting incoming call to tSIP (Settings/Contacts, HTTP query, e.g. https://www.yandex.com/search/?text=[number] where "[number]" would be replaced with number from current or last incoming call). Previously it was available only as manual action and personally I would prefer it that way. All function keys are configurable (BLF/speed dial/DTMF/etc., similar to desk phones). After configuring "HTTP query" button, global shortcut (e.g. Ctrl + Browser Forward key combination that most likely would be unused) can be assigned to it making it relatively effortless to open page if softphone sits it tray (action for shortcut = "button #", ID = button ID as visible when editing button).
I found http://www.phoner.de/index_en.htm does this. Options -> External Application and then run a .bat file with something like:
Does anyone know of a SIP client that can open a web page to a configurable URL when someone calls? We have a web-based database, and I'd like to search by phone number whenever we get an incoming call, and have the person on screen before I answer it.
