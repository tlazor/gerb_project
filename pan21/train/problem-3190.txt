I just realized that I should have used the Boot Camp Assistant to remove BOOTCAMP partition, but since I have erased BOOTCAMP partition, this way no longer works.
I have decided to remove Windows from my MacBook. I used to the Disk Utility tool erased BOOTCAMP partition, but when I tried to use "Partition" menu to merge BOOTCAMP partition into Machintosh HD, Machintosh HD's size couldn't adjusted.
To do this, power down and Press and hold one of the key sequences below immediately after you turn on your Mac and hear the startup sound. 
Once you're in OS Setup, you can choose Disk Manager from the Tools menu and resize your Macintosh HD partition.
My MacBook Air was installed two systems, OSX and Windows, thus it has two disk partitions: Machintosh HD (40G) and BOOTCAMP (80G).
You cannot actively resize the boot partition for OS X and a few other operating systems. What you can do start up your Mac in Recovery mode. 
Given my current situation, how can be remove BOOTCAMP, and merge all disk space back to Machintosh HD?
