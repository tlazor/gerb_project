I have a simple webserver with a directory listing of a bunch of movies. I want to be able to click on one of these movies on another pc and have the browser open Media Player Classic with the link I clicked as a parameter. I do not want to have the browser download the file then play it. I want to invoke MPC with the URL as a parameter.
Basically, MPC has no problem streaming links from the webserver by being invoked with the URL as a parameter. How can I send the URL to the program?
I know I can set a default action for the type of file that I want to play but then Firefox downloads the whole file and passes the path to the external program. I don't want the browser to download it, I just want to pass the URL.
I can open the link in MPC and it does what I want. I can start MPC with the URL as a parameter and it does what I want. I can also drag the link from the browser to an existing MPC window and it does what I want (This is what I'm doing now with MPC set to "always on top"). What I really want is to click the links and have the program start without downloading the file locally, probably by looking at the extension.
I will eventually look into setting up some kind of streaming service on the host pc, but for now I'd like to do it simply.
I'm looking for an add-on or another way to have Firefox (or Chrome or anything else really) open an external program when clicking on certain links and send the URL I clicked to that program.
I tried a Firefox add-on called "Open Link in Program" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/olip/) but it does not send the complete link to the external program, only the domain part, so it's useless.
