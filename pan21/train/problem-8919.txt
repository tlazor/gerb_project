I did a best configuration, restore, then a disk check on next startup by right clicking on the C drive.
If it is stuck likely you have a hard drive issue.  You are not going to harm it further by forcing it to shut down.  So, go for it, that is your only option anyway.
The next time it started I got a blinking cursor and could only get into the Repair Console using my OS CD and it no longer starts in safemode.
From the repair console I replaced the hal.dll file (as I had this error) and no joy, then I did a bootcfg etc. no luck, then I did a chkdisk /p and it said no need for scan, disc is fine, so I forced a chkdsk /p /r and its been running about 6 hours, was moving progressively but is now stuck at 74%...
By using chkdsk /p /r, you are instructing it to perform an extensive check and correct any errors while recovering any readable information.  Which means it is going to check the whole hard drive.
My question is how long should I let it run??? and is the only way out holding down the power key, and if I do that will my laptop be toast?
You say you have been using it for years.  So, I would recommend slaving the drive to a working machine and copying any information off of it that you don't want to lose.
