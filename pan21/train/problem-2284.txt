Our openVPN instance tunnels right through our hardware firewalls without issue. The simple test is to connect the server to a client via openVPN, and block all FTP traffic at the firewall level. Ideally a If Destination is myServer:FTP and source is any THEN DROP/Reject type rule. I don't know what format of rules your firewall may take.
Windows server 2008 R2 - I have setup OpenVPN, how do I give users connected to it access to an FTP server on the account (but no other users).
If you CANNOT access FTP from the openVPN client, you'll have to open FTP to the server from your openVPN ip range and drop/reject it from all others.
You might either set your filters to allow this range for FTP or place your OpenVPN gateway behind the firewall appliance, allowing OpenVPN clients unlimited access. I would not recommend the latter as you would be giving up all control, but I have seen installations doing exactly this for the sake of simplicity.
Obvious alternative depending on the openVPN config and the FTP server software: ONLY listen on the openVPN ip address / adapter
