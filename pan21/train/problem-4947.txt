I'd tend to think that you should be worried about the bandwidth between the intended clients and the VPS. If your intended clients are mostly in .AU it would make sense to get a VPS located in Australia. Who do you intend to be clients? 
If you targeting the world as potential clients, I'd probably start with a server located somewhere outside of Australia. As you scale up you can make the decision to obtain geographically varied hosting (and whatever technical mechanism you want to use to distribute clients-- GeoDNS, etc) to spread clients around the various hosting sites efficiently.
That said though, if you're running something that's latency dependant (like, streaming videos) then you need to go for as few hops as possible, which means that you should be getting a physical location as close as possible to your customer base.
Womble might disagree with me here, but Australia does have pretty shitty datacentre uplinks, and to get a good one it costs a lot of money. Which means that a decent VPS hosted in Australia is going to cost you a lot more than getting one hosted in the US.
