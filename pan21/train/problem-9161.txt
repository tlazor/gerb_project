The virtual hard disk of the client has probably lots of deleted blocks, but the backup stores them, as they are part of the file.
A virtual disk is similar to a real disk - the OS deletes content by flagging the file and the blocks as deleted; but it doesn't overwrite the content. Seen from the host system, the virtual hard disk is just a big file, and the host of course cannot decide which bytes are this kind of old remains, and which are really needed, so all will be considered part of the file, and will be backed up.
There are ways to 'clean up' the virtual hard disk, and reduce its apparent size. Typically, you do:
Note that usage of the VM will slowly increase its size again, as every write/delete sequence produces the blocks filled with 'data', so you will need to repeat the steps after some months of usage.
As part of a disaster recovery test, we made a backup of a virtual machine that runs our SQL server. The backup file was >360GB and took a long time to copy over USB 2.0 (don't ask me why our disaster recovery company didn't have usb 3.0). However, when we got the VM restored, I ran WinDirStat in it to determine what was taking up so much space, but the total space used reported by WinDirStat was only 100 gigs.
