It seems that you haven't this behaviour. Perhaps it's just the sleep settings (indeed, if the remote computer enter in a slepping mode, all activities stopped (network, disk, compute). Set settings according to you need. But perhaps these settings are set by a Group Policy. Then, contact you administrator to put a exclusion for your remote computer. 
Often, i'm launching script file on remote computers, and this runs a long long time. Do you really think that i'm put my ass on the chair waiting for it to end and praying not to be disconnected ? No, I'm quit and the next day, I'll continue
When the RDP session is lost cause various causes like network contention, you are only disconnected. You session is not closed, you are only disconnected. Then when you'll reconnect to the session (same user of course) and you'll retreive all informations, treatments and so on in your current session. You was just idle. 
Answering strictly to the question from its title, beside the VNC Viewer you can always use the TeamViewer.
