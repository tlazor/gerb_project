Given how you are asking this question, it sounds like you should hire a consultant for this.  I'd also ask this question: Do you need to move the whole website or can you create another sub-domain and use that?   www.example.com is your public website, mobileop.example.com runs your internal services.  mobileop.example.com could be run on a separate server on your internal network and wouldn't necessarily touch anything on your public one.
the company now is entering a mobile operator business which requires that the website to be moved to our internal network to let the user use our website to access some services.
If it's just another service, set up a new server inside a DMZ (ask your networking guy), configure it with a public IP or let your firewall do some NAT.
Setup a server on your internal network, copy your content over (you might also need to make sure you're running the same CMS internally.)  Then figure out how to allow access to that server on your internal network (maybe even put it on a DMZ.)  Then change the public DNS record to point to your server.
Name that new server whatever your service will be like, e.g. access.company.com and create a A-Record for it. 
So many options.  Don't tell the consultant exactly what you want done, tell them what your end goal is.
right now i'm still confused of what to do, what are the steps required to move the host and still alow the people when they type my company domain in the browser to be directed to the new location which is inside my company network , how the DNS NS Public IP issues has to be considered
