We just migrated from Exchange 2003 to 2007 which was a combo primary AD/DNS server and it has not gone smoothly.  We are now down to getting a new certificate (a bureaucratic process thats out of my hands) and users getting the 0x8004010F sync issue.  We are only using Outlook 2007 as our email client and the sync error appears exactly as so:
Now, I have read a number of technet articles on this issue anywhere from adding an A record in the DNS for autodiscover.domain.com to syncing the old OAD to the new OAD.  In otherwords, theres lots of thing to try, but trial and error at this point might be hazardous to ther server's health and I am trying to narrow down the list of things to try.  What has me thinking that the sync error could be related to the certificate is an event error message that says the following:
I am not fully clear on how the Exchange Transport Service is related to Syncronization, but my hunch is that it probably not related to there not being a valid certificate.  So to recap, would an invalid certificate cause an 0x8004010F sync error?
