The Kernel is compiled prior to installation on a system, so in a since its size is set in stone. Drivers and any other modules or programs will not affect the size of the kernel. Only recompiling the kernel would change its size. 
You may have the option to choose the GUI, Gnome or KDE. But that is like the options on a car. You can change the paint and add leather seats, but it is still a 4 cylinder under the hood.
That's why there are so many versions of Linux. Small to huge. Some are compiled to work without a GUI interface at all in order to be small and lean for projects that only need a terminal connection like the IOT (Internet Of Things). Some have custom GUI's, like Ubuntu and RedHat etc. 
As the drivers are usually built as kernel modules, I use the two terms "drivers" and "modules" interchangeably. The modules are the files ending with *.ko (kernel objects). They are usually located in a sub-folder below /lib/modules.
There is more information in Linux loadable kernel modules HOWTO. A good way to learn more about kernel and modules is to build a kernel yourself. It is not as difficult as it sounds. There are tutorials for Ubuntu and for stock kernels. (you probably find more tutorials if you google).
