I work for a SMB.  Our central office houses our servers, and users in that office have accounts with roaming profiles.  In the near future, we are looking to invest in branch AD servers, which will then be configured to house roaming profiles for their respective branches.  All branches are a part of the same domain.
Does any one know how to implement such a solution?  Or, have a recommendation on how to achieve the goal in another fashion?
I've looked at Group Policy (Computer\Policies\Admin Templates\System\User Profiles).  Nothing there, by itself, seems to be quite what I am looking for.
However, occasionally a manager may go to another branch, and log in to a workstation there.  At that point, their roaming profile (which might several GB large) will try to pull down to that workstation.  Even across decent WAN connection, this can all day.
Ideally, what I would like to do is have GPOs linked to each branch's parent OU that tells each branch workstation to only roam profiles that have a Security Group that targets that branch.  (Eg.  Our New York workstations only allow roaming profiles for users who are members of the "New York Roamers" security group, so that when someone from Seattle sits down at a workstation in New York, their profile does not try to roam from the server in Seattle.)
