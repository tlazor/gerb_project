If you're an experienced programmer, there are likely only two things you'll need to learn here. One is how to draw sprites to the screen, which is not terribly hard -- there are tons of libraries that will let you do this, PyGame has the functionality built in if you go with Python. The other is, assuming this is a multiplayer game to be played over the internet, you'll need to figure out how to establish a connection and send messages over a network. But that's really it... aside from that, treat it like any other software project.
I'm not a dev noob, but definitely never done anything in game dev. There is a trump based card game we play in town that I plan on coding. I'll be either using python/ajax/pyqt or c++/qt. 
The good news about card games is, they are some of the simplest to program, so this is a great first project for getting into game dev. Why? Because you don't have to deal with a great deal of graphics (simple sprites for the cards, no scrolling, no 3d, not even necessarily any animation) nor do you require realtime input (when you say "trump based" I assume this is a turn-based game where you select cards one at a time to take tricks), so the event-driven programming that you're used to in more general software development can apply here just fine.
