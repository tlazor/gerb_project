Low priority services don't notify, medium priority alerts notify by email and high priority alerts notify by email and phone. Except they don't (yet)
We have 3 templates for services, low-priority, high-priorty and medium-priorty. Low priority services are attached to the contactgroup low, medium priorty services are attached to the contact group medium and high priority (OK you probably get the idea).
What I need to do is specify that any alerts generated by high-priorty services should run the notification commands notify-service-by-email and notify-service-by-phone. From reading the documentation (and my knowledge of Nagios) the only way I know to set notification commands is the service_notification_commands option in a contact, but that would mean each contact would need two definitions, one for phone and one for email. How would I get high-priority services to call the notify-service-by-phone command?
It seems that you need to define your contacts twice. One definition to be notified only by email and another definition to be notified by both email and phone.
