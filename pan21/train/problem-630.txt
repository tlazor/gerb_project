If all you need is any Unix for your virtual hosts, also look at Solaris zones.  You'll get a lot better performance as everything runs under one kernel, and you don't have to pre-allocate memory.  It's not the same as something like virtualbox which runs a completely independent OS but handles the requirements of most Unix virtualization.  If you need open source, look at the replacement for OpenSolaris: http://openindiana.org/
ZFS is cool thing, but if you're going to use Linux you'd better forget about ZFS, at least for some time until its kernel-level port is matured enough. Actually, Linux Soft RAID x LVM-2 x {EXT{3,4}, Reiser3} will be quite enough. Why? -- Well, hosting is mostly about giving data out, not getting it (though it depends on what your hosted apps do exactly). I mean, your disks are reading mostly, not writing, so ZFS' COW and always-full-stripe write is kinda non-topical feature. All those scare things regarding bits flip-flops are rather extremely rare if you use qualitative hardware. Scratching your Linux Soft RAID you will have opportunities to be assured in it. Its bitmaps and fast partial re-sync is your protection from RAID5-write-holes w/o any BBUs and stripe cache is quite a valuable speed-up provider when doing partial writes.

You should also consider using FreeBSD, recent versions of FreeBSD support ZFS natively. FreeBSD supports VirtualBox as a host.
Solaris Zones (a.k.a. Containers) were originally able to run "Branded Zones," which were slightly different than just another instance of Solaris 10. Solaris 8 and Linux were the only two Branded Zones that I ever saw.
