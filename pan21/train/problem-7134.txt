BUT, there is a mighty big catch there: There almost certainly IS a deeper theory that supersedes it, a theory of "quantum gravity". Quantum physics has no model for gravity, and every attempt to add one has caused the whole thing to fall apart. Our best theory for that force, General Relativity, IS nonlinear and is has survived just as much experimental scrutiny as quantum physics.
As the accepted answer implies, Quantum Mechanics is a linear theory. That means that unless there is a deeper theory that supersedes it (just as it & Einstein's General Relativity jointly replaced Newtonian Mechanics), then you cannot have non-linear evolution of quantum systems.
The upshot is this: For a machine powered purely by known quantum physics, you won't be able to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. But that is a far weaker statement than asserting that the laws of physics definitely PRECLUDE solving NP-complete problems efficiently. Start running that quantum computer in a high gravity field and WE DON'T KNOW what will happen. And given that there are plenty of examples in mathematics of conjectures thought to be true for CENTURIES that were later dis-proven, failing to have found any polynomial-time algorithm for solving NP-complete problems (or nonlinear quantum operators) after less than 80 years of searching is more "par for the course" than "hard evidence none exists".
