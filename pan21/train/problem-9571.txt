IPSec tunnels are established between given source and destination address ranges; you can't just treat them like tubes into which arbitrary traffic can be poured.  You will need to establish a tunnel between 10.0.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 on both VPN routers.
On a FVS338, you can configure a second LAN network. So I set 10.0.1.250 as the second IP address of my right VPN router. Then I made a rule to forward ports I need from the public IP to 10.0.1.8. Now I can connect to 10.0.1.8 !
Dimitar has the first part of the process, but not the second.  It is true that the right-hand side VPN router will need a presence on the 10.0.1.0 network (I'm guessing it's a /24), but if your network diagram is accurate and complete, and 10.0.1.8 can already reach the internet, it probably already has one.
If RHS VPN router's 10.0.1 presence is not 10.0.1.8's default route, you will need to mess with the routing tables on 10.1.0.8, but that's for after we have the right tunnel(s) up.
As long as both machines can connect to the internet you should be able to connect to them from one to another using the software to create a 'Tunnel' for you and remotely screen share and share files from one to the other.
If it's something like remoting on to the machine for an RDP session or something like that you could use something like LOGMEIN or equivalent, especially if you don't have control or access to all the information at hand.
