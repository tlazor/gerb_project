I am using Ola Hallengren's maintenance solution to back up a SQL 2012 Express instance in our environment. I am a brand new DBA, only 10 weeks old so I am not too familiar yet but I am learning fast. I am pretty sure I have everything configured the way we want it. I created the stored procedures in the master database of our express instance and I have scheduled batch files to be executed nightly from within Windows Task Scheduler and all seems to be set up and working minus one detail, the logging to table.
If you look at the [dbo].[CommandExecute] stored procedure that Ola's scripts use, it looks like they are expecting the [dbo].[CommandLog] logging table to exist in the same database where the scripts are executing.
First of all, I am not quite sure how to enable it or what database to find the table in if it is enabled? 
Second, I would like to log the results to a table in a different database on a different server\instance. Is this possible? If so, does anyone have any direction they can point me to so I can set this up?
The only way I know that you could log these commands to another SQL Server instance would be to create a linked server to that remote instance and add an AFTER insert/update trigger to the [dbo].[CommandLog] table which would insert/update the remote instance version of the table.  You'd still need to delete entries periodically from the local instance as they would originally be logged there first.
