However, I would suggest being very careful when editing the registry keys, because you can easily create more problems for yourself later.
What I had was a bootleg version, which is what you may have. Running a cleaner might work, but what I did was made a folder for Chromium /manually/ then I deleted it. For some reason, it worked. 
Because I don't know your level of knowledge with computers, I will also point out being an expert does not exempt you from making mistakes like that.  At some point, we could all make that 1 mistake. :)
When I had Chromium on my computer, I went in the files to uninstall it, but it was still messing with my computer. 
I know it's not the answer you are looking for, but unless there's a guide out there that will give you steps to take for Chrome (Chromium), i would uninstall the program, run a registry cleaner, and leave it at that.  Most orphan keys and files are not going to cause a lot of trouble anyways, and are generally there for a reason.  So if you remove one that is shared by other programs or Windows, it will create more problems than it will fix.
