To run a program on a number of Raspberry Pi's (nodes) from a PC (server - assume IP is 192.168.0.100):
This is reply to Guido Garcia's post above regarding 'dispy' - I can't figure out how to reply to his post.
When a program ('/bin/ls') is distributed with 'dispy' for parallel execution, then that program on the client machine is transferred to each of the nodes (to '/tmp'). This is so that the user developed program on the client machine is transferred without having NFS or some shared diretory. This works with binary programs only when nodes and client architectures are compatible. In your case, I am guessing that client architecture is different from that of the remote nodes and a node can't execute the binary '/bin/ls' transferred from the client. If you want to execute /bin/ls on each node, it may easier to write a Python function or program to print the directory (e.g., using os.listdir) and distribute that instead of binary executable.
You can also include dependencies such as python objects, modules and files (which dispy will transfer to each node) by adding depends=[ClassA, moduleB, 'file1']

Some guys at Southampton Uni have put together a cluster and written a detailed overview of their work at http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sjc/raspberrypi/.
There's also http://pi.interworx.com if you want a full featured control panel with it.  They have instructions up on this page on how to replicate, but you'll have to be patient as that subdomain tself is running from a Rasberry Pi cluster.  Here's a photo in case it goes down:
