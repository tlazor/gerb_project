I have an external drive where I keep my backups. I use rsync to keep it up to date with what is on my computer. I have a git repository at the root directory of the external drive and I never sync a source folder directly to the root directory, always to a subdirectory -- that way if a source folder is a git repository it won't conflict with the git repository at the root of the external drive. Since the files on my computer include git repositories, I have a script that follows these steps for any folder that I'm backing up:
The result is that I have a git repository that contains the current state of all my files, and I can look back in time as usual with the git history.  The git repositories are backed up too, but their state is separate from the git repository at the root of the backup drive. So whatever untracked, uncommitted files I had in any of my git repositories do get committed to the git repository at the root of the backup drive. 
The git repositories in the backup drive (e.g. dst/path/to/repo/.git) are just the latest copies with no meta-history.
