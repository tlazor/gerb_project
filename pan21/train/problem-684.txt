I configure the backup so that on completion it runs a (VBScript) script that looks through the backup log, works out whether the backup worked or not and writes a record into a central database with the backup result. Then at head office I run a script that queries this database and presents me with a list of sites where either the backup reported an error or there was no report from the site.
Some of the servers use Backup Exec, some NTBackup and some just copy their files to another server across the network. It doesn't matter what type of backup the servers do as it's easy to tweak my VBScript to check for errors. My script is actually pretty basic, it just opens the backup report as a text file and greps for phrases like "failed to mount", "tape full", "CRC error" etc, etc. I'm sure a professional programmer would do a slicker job. However the whole thing is simple and robust, and it's proactive in the sense that I see the backup failure report whether I want to or not and I'd only fail to notice an error if I consciously decided to ignore the report.
PS 99% of the backup failures are because the users forgot to change the backup tape. Don't you just love lusers :-)
The point of all this is that the default assumption is that the backup failed, and the backup is considered to have worked only if my VBScript detected no errors and wrote this conclusion I to my database. This makes sure backup failures don't go unnoticed.
The end result is that when I sit down at my desk I have a list of all the sites where I need to check the backup.
I am responsible for about 200 servers spread across the North West of the UK, and this is obviously far too many to check manually.
