(I am reproducing here a blog post, Hindsight, from a couple of years ago, as suggested in the comments.)
In a lecture by Madhu Sudan* he claimed there was some belief that there exists $s > 1/2$ such that $\text{PCP}_{1,s}[ \log n, 3] \subseteq \text{P}$, via semidefinite programming, prior to the proof of Håstad's three bit PCP theorem. 
Indeed SDP does show $\text{PCP}_{1,1/2}[ \log n, 3] = \text{P}$, giving a tight bound on the complexity of such PCPs.
This was disproven in 2014, by Allan Grønlund and Seth Pettie, who gave a deterministic algorithm that runs in $O(n^2/(\log n/\log \log n)^{2/3})$ time [1].
The $\mathsf{3SUM}$-conjecture: That any deterministic algorithm for $\mathsf{3SUM}$ requires $\Omega(n^2)$ time.
From Georg Kreisel's review of The decision problem for exponential diophantine equations, by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam, and Julia Robinson, Ann. of Math. (2), 74 (3), (1961), 425–436. MR0133227 (24 #A3061).
$\mathsf{NL} \neq \mathsf{coNL}$. Prior to the result that these two were equal, I think it was widely believed that they were distinct, by analogy with the belief that $\mathsf{NP} \neq \mathsf{coNP}$ (i.e. the general principle that "nondeterministism and co-nondeterminism are different"; this turned out to be false under space complexity bounds that were at least logarithmic).
Of course, my favorite quote in relation to the tenth problem is from the Foreword by Martin Davis to Yuri Matiyasevich’s Hilbert’s tenth problem.

The solution of Hilbert's tenth problem by Davis, Matiyasevich, Putnam, and Robinson, showing that the recursively enumerable sets are precisely the Diophantine sets. 
Prior to $\mathsf{IP} = \mathsf{PSPACE}$, it was thought possible that even $\mathsf{coNP}$ wasn't contained in $\mathsf{IP}$: in Fortnow-Sipser 1988 they conjectured this to be the case and gave an oracle relative to which it was true.
