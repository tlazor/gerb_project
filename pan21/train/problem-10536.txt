If the drive is external via USB then you will be limited by the USB bus speed. USB2 drives tend to top out between 25 and 30Mbyte/sec, at 25Mbyte/sec g5Gb will take 45 minutes minimum. Some USB drives are slower then this (I had an old PATA->USB adaptor that won;t go above 10Mbyte/sec)
If you are copying many small files, or if the source disk is very badly fragmented, then you will not get close to the maximum transfer speed as the drive heads will be bouncing around all over the place (while the drive heads are moving from location to location no data can be transferred), unless of course both drives are decent SSDs. If it is a mix of large and small files you might find that it has started with a directory full of small ones so is estimating the total time using the speed it is copying them, and it will speed up once it hits the larger files.
I guess your big E: drive is an external hard drive. And this disk must be linked to your computer thru USB port. USB is really slow.
Hifolks..It takes 12 hrs to transfer 250gb of files from one 500gb external drive to another 500gb external drive using the usb ports on my windows xp professional laptop.as you say its importent to do a DE- FRAG first.the drives are INTENSO.Im happy with this.
If both drives are PATA/IDE then make sure they're both on the same bus/IDE channel, primary and master.
