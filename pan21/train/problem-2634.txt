The regular setup I know of is a load balancer terminating SSL and then making unencrypted requests to the backend servers.
The straightforward thing I can think of is having a separate SSL certificate for each backend server, e.g. https://node1.example.com, https://node2.example.com, https://node3.example.com etc that the load balancer connects to.
Another option is to create a wildcard certificate ("*.example.com") and use it on all relevant hosts.
If I want to have an SSL connection from the load balancer to the backend servers, though, how do I implement that?
It's possible to set up a single certificate with multiple Subject AltNames (sometimes called a SAN certificate or multi-domain certificate).
SNI works for backend servers as well, so just have one cert for all backend servers with all the host names in it.
Certificates should always be handled in a secure manner, but naturally this gets especially important with wildcard certificates that a malicious third-party could use to wreak all kinds of havoc.
