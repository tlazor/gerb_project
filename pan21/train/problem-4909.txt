You would have to make changes to EVERYONE's routers who wants to connect, plus your own, some of which will not support, or have hard to find in the GUI, the static route feature required to perform this routing change. Plus you would need to change settings on your new server to accept traffic destined for the old address. Plus you would need to add special firewall rules on everyone's routers, everyone's windows, and possibly re-write minecraft, to allow return traffic to come from your new server's IP address instead of from the one minecraft thought it sent it to. Plus it would only be able to use IP addresses and not names anyway.
This means that No you can't just change your router to do what you want. This is because you cannot change the routers outside of your control, such as the general internet across 2 or more ISPs.
It would be MUCH easier to make everyone switch over to using the name, than reconfiguring everything for everyone.
Assuming you mean both routers have different Internet Service Provider (ISP) and not IPS, this will mean they have a different internet connection to you and are on a separate LAN than you.
Then in the future if you want to change servers you can just change the DNS registration to go to the new IP address. This is why the DNS system was invented.
