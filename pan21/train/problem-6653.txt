I have seen some systems that had a SATA controller that you could set up to use "PATA Emulation" (or some similar description) in the BIOS and so use with an older OS like Windows XP without having to install a special set of drivers but that option is very dependant on what controller is actually in your system.
I'm assuming that you are meaning SATA, as in "Serial ATA" rather than PATA, which is more commonly known as IDE.
you need a driver for the controller, not for the hard drive (unless the hdd is bigger than 2 TB - xp won't work with that)
Other than that you may get away with not having to give the driver during installation, as it may "just work" in a degraded mode until you can get into Windows itself to install the driver from your motherboard manufacturer.
Generally as Magnetic_dud say you will need to find out what SATA controller you have in your system and create a driver floppy disk in order to set it up when installing Windows.
I want to reinstall my PC with Windows 7, but I have a problem with my hard disk, I use ATA harddisk, so I need driver for my hard disk. But I cannot found any driver, I decide to install windows xp, but I wonder about the same problem like before, my question is, is ATA harddisk support for windows XP SP 3 ? XP SP 2 ?
