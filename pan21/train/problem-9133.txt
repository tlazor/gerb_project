If you are using Windows, this will also work (it says Win2k, but it works on XP): HOW TO: Determine BIOS Date on a Computer Running Windows 2000 
As others have mentioned, this doesn't take into account any newer upgrades or pieces installed post-purchase, but would give you a good place to start with.
Are you running Windows? Go to command prompt and enter "systeminfo | more".  Then look for the line items that have Original Install Date for when the OS was installed, system manufacturer, system model, processor type, BIOS version, etc.  Depending on exactly why you want to know how old your computer is, the above information should be able to provide it or a sufficient enough answer by getting further information from the manufacturer (e.g.  processor was initially released in Month/Year). 
Download & install a program called Soluto. I have used it for the past couple of years since it was created, initially to select which programs start up at boot, thereby reducing boot time. Since being first introduced it keeps adding new features.
Depending on your BIOS, you may have a date that it was installed on the system, this is essentially the "birth date" of your computer. I think most IBM clone machines (ie. non-mac) use Phoenix BIOS now, the date is the very last line on the POST screen.
If your computer was purchased from one of the major PC manufacturers (ie: Dell) then you can type in your service tag/serial number to find out when the computer was purchased.
