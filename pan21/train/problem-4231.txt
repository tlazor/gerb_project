How about going to the end of where the hyperlink is and pressing backdelete, to remove the link aspect of it
Another way is copy/paste the link into notepad then back into msword. Then don't push ENTER after it.  If you want a new line or more after it, and you don't already have them, then make  the new lines before you paste the link in. So the link is there but it comes out as plain text and you have new lines after it if need be.
I do not know if Word 2011 for Mac is the equivalent of Word 2010 for Windows.   If so, check Word Options > Advanced > Use Ctrl + Click to follow hyperlinks. It should be selected so that hyperlinks will not open when you click on them.  If you have such an option and select it then hyperlinks in your document will be opened with Ctrl + Left Click, if it is not selected hyperlinks will open when you click on them.  Hope this helps.
I went looking for this for the same reason - it isn't on the preferences menus anywhere.  Just by chance, I discovered that if you use Ctrl+Click (the default for Windows), it doesn't open the link when you click.  My links were behind pictures not words, but I would suspect it'll work the same way.
So, when a link is there, you make sure it doesn't go blue and start looking like a link detected by Ms Word, otherwise if it is clicked it will open.
