I use Qualys to scan against my network.  I have customers that use IBM's AppScanner against my network.  These tools (on of their jobs is to) evaluate the certificate.  Never have they complained about the certificate. 
Again, these are all really minor when you factor in the low cost and the near-instant access to your certificates.
I use RapidSSL.  Clients that access my site are all Fortune 500 type companies.  None of them have ever had a problem with the certificate that I use.  
Super-fast verification: some of them require you to fax in company letterhead, and/or their "verification team" takes 3-4 business days to activate.  RapidSSL uses an automated system whereas you're presented with a verification code on the screen that must be keyed into the phone when they call.
And with wildcard certificates, you cannot always use the base name with the cert.  For instance: I buy a wildcard for *.mydomain.com and can put anything in for the star.  But cannot use it for just http://mydomain.com.  Some others allow you to do this.
I've used RapidSSL for years for my clients and have no problem with them at all with browser support.
Phone support is a bit spotty, although I've only had to call them once when I didn't have a direct line to use... which brings me to the second minor con: you need a direct line, no extensions, etc. and it can't be a cell phone for the verification to work.  This usually isn't an issue though as you can give the receptionist a heads-up that you're expecting a call in x amount of seconds (you can specify how long to wait to dial).
RapidSSL calls every year to remind me to renew, and to sell me their more expensive certificate.  The only difference in the more expensive certificate is the name from the end user's point of view.  The reality is that a RapidSSL certificate has been issued without full verification of the user or business purchasing it.( As mctylr is saying with "trust-worthiness")
