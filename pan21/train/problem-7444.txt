While broadcast traffic, duplcate ACK's and TCP retransmits are a normal part of network communication on any network, a large volume of them is an indication of a problem. If running Wireshark on the client doesn't yield any results then you'll need to move Wireshark closer to the destination (server) one hop at a time (where possible) until you're able to see something in the capture that gives you an idea of what's happening.
Another tool you can use is Colasoft Capsa (they have a free edition) which has a much easier to intepret interface and has several different ways to "visualize" the capture, making it easier to "see" the problem.
A high volume of broadcast traffic (at either the physical or network layer or both), which is an indication that there's congestion and is likely causing the following symptoms:
Wireshark could help, depending on what's the actual cause of the problem. The caveat being that Wireshark is only going to show you one side of the conversation (unless you run Wireshark simultaneously on the client and the server) and can't show you anything that's happening in between the source and destination. I would run Wireshark on one of the affected clients and key on these things:
