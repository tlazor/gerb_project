Repeat for other columns such as country, state etc. If you base all the pivots off the same data range they will all refresh together when you refresh any one of them. Your process will now be: add new data, refresh pivots, use updated data validation.
Note that you can use a range from a different worksheet as a source for data validation if you do this by defining a named range. You can't use a normal range explicitly referring to another sheet.
Add a Pivot Table from the data on another sheet. Use Years as rows, the rest of the table is irrelevant. Sort and filter the rows as required (eg explicitly filter OUT "[blank]"). Make the cells where the row labels are into the target of your data validation.
Messy. There's no built-in way to do that that automatically updates. It would be simpler to just create a separate list with all the possible years that you could be interested in rather than trying to limit it to those in your data set.
Further thoughts: Using a table for the source data will make it easy to update the Pivot Tables since they will always use the whole table. Alternatively use an expanding named range as the data source to avoid issues when you add more rows.
