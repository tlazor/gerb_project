Now, if server2 is not internet accessible at all, then you'll need to use some form of connection forwarding. I'm assuming you're using Linux... rinetd is fairly simple to set up.  You configure ports to listen on, and where those ports should go. All it does is whenever someone connects to it, it connects to the configured server and passes the data back and forth.  With any kind of forwarding, one thing to keep in mind is that since the client thinks it's talking to server1, if you use SSL, the SSL certificate on server2 needs to match server1.
I think this cries out for "why would you do that?!"  Just edit server1.com's DNS zone and add something like  mail.server1.com A [server2'sIPAddress] and configure mail.server1.com as the MX record for the server1.com domain.  There's nothing that says a server can't have more than one name, or even more than one domain.  Keep in mind if you're paying for bandwidth, piping traffic between servers basically doubles your usage (everything coming in goes right back out).
