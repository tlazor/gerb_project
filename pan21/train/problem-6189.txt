It's a very basic question but I did spend some time searching the Internet but most of the answers refer to some special cases when keys are being store in the code or require third party encryption or what not. I'm looking for a kinda basic best practice guidelines.  
Also, I don't need a password encryption on that key (in my particular case, but I think it would be nice to know as option b) as well.)
I had to generate something that has a .key extension. And the instruction simply says "store it securely". How??? 
My question goes beyond the one about storing SSH keys in that it's more general. Actually, I have looked at my .ssh folder. I see that it's 600, will it be reasonable to store all the keys there?. But I've just read that browsers can read from that folder...
The answer I'm hoping to get here is, e.g.,  should it be a folder? With what permissions on a folder? Is there any conventional name and/or location on a disk where to keep it? Or the more random, the better?  What should be the permissions on the file itself (400 I guess?)...
