But the real question is:  Will 16 bit code, which DOS and Windows is written in, run natively on a 64 bit processor?  Im not sure about that.
If your Lenovo IdeaPad U410 has any "funky" hardware, especially core components, you might not be able to install DOS as there wont be any drivers for it.  For example, your keyboard and mouse might not work.  If this is the case, you could use a USB keyboard, as long as your BIOS supports legacy USB support (all I have seen do).
It's best to install DOS on a partition less than 120 MB, because the way Win9x works, it will try to convert the partition into a fat32 partition.
DOS is pretty kind to unknown partitions, since there are proggies (like Novell Netware), that use DOS as a boot block, and then mount an unknown partition.  It certainly lives quite happily beside things like BOOTMGR, HPFS and NTFS.
Some versions of DOS will bork, if there are several primary partitions, and the first partition on the extended partition is not a fat16 one.  
Some of the more recent computer hardware uses different kinds of setup, which not only affects DOS, but even later operating systems like WinXP.  You might see if you can see your dos partition from a dos boot diskette, before doing drastic things.  
Your BIOS might need to support IDE emulation for SATA drives (hard disk and CD), otherwise DOS might not see the drives as well.  Even if thats the case, there still is a chance it wont work with modern hardware.  Even, if it does work, the hard drive, FAT16 will limit volumes to 2GB.
DR-DOS does not booting from partitions other than 1.  You can't create two primary partitions, and install drdos on the second one.  But PC-DOS and MS-DOS don't seem to mind.  You can't start dos from an extended partition either.  
You tagged the question with virtualbox. If you are using a type 2 hypervisor like that, there will be no effect on your host operating system. The MS-DOS virtual machine will not even be aware of the host machine.
