So on initial reading of your question, you can't do these things with just an ALB (or ALB+WAF) -- you can't selectively redirect, or change where the traffic goes (target groups use static rules for host and/or path patterns, and these rules do not interact with WAF rules -- these rules only apply to traffic WAF chose to allow).
However, if simply preventing access to specific paths like (e.g.) /specific and /specific/* for clients who are not on an allowed list is sufficient, then ALB can do that with WAF.
Web Application Firewall (WAF) can attach to an ALB and allow or deny certain requests based on rule analysis, such as the client IP address or path (or a combination), but is limited to allowing or denying requests (or "counting" them -- for purposes like testing a rule's matching without actually applying it).
It isn't necessarily clear from the marketing materials, but WAF isn't exactly a separate service, in the sense that there is no actual firewall device or platform that all of your traffic is always passing through, and it can't be used all by itself.  WAF is essentially an add-on feature of ALB and CloudFront and API Gateway, where a hook in the front-end of those services sends the first full buffer of each request for analysis and WAF decides, based on your rules, to tell the front-end to either allow or deny each request.
