Don't do that.  At best, it is a waste of bandwidth.  At worst, it's spam.  It will do nothing but annoy people and could damage your mailserver's reputation.
The noreply address (which bounces) is meant to prevent anyone from receiving a reply to automatically generated emails.
Naturally, I firewalled his IP address and reconfigured the app to use a more appropriate noreply address.
You'll run into a noreply address eventually which auto-replies with "no, really, no replies to this address" and an infinite loop of email will be born.
By coincidence, just last night I received such an email from a user of a website I admin, because the autogenerated mail had the return address of hostmaster@example.com, instead of a noreply address. I received several of them, in fact, profanity laced all-caps screaming with dozens of exclamation points, all intended for someone else.
If the mail comes from an address noreply@xyz.com, then the systems responds with "why would we want to read your mail if you don't let us reply".
