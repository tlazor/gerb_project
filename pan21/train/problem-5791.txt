Beware of SSL in a corporate environment.  There are many companies that make so-called "SSL interceptors" that effectively perform a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack on your SSL connection so the company can monitor the content being transferred, while both your browser and the external Web server each think they have a secure SSL connection to the other.  Bluecoat's ProxySG product includes a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) feature that does just this.
This works in corporate environments, because the company typically has administrative access to your computer, which allows them to install new CA certs into your browser (unbeknownst to you).  The new CA cert tells your browser to trust the company's SSL interceptor, so that it can decrypt all of your SSL traffic (before re-encrypting it on the outbound leg to the external server).
You can use openssl to dump the external Web server's SSL cert from outside the company and compare it with the cert seen from inside the company (as described in this blog post). If they don't match, then your company may be running an SSL interceptor.
