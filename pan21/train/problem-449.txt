But remember, any changes you make in one window and save will supersede what you're looking at in the other window.  If you work in two areas of the same document in two different windows, you risk losing half of your work when you save either one.
You can open multiple windows, including the same document, but those views are not synchronized (changes in one aren't reflected in the other).  Each window reflects the version of the document as last saved.  So if it is adequate for your purpose to refer to old, static contents in a second window, that can be a partial solution.  
This has been a long-standing request but not yet implemented.  As of LO Version 5, Writer is not among the suite's apps that can split a window.  From LO Help: 
In MS-Word, you can split a window with a horizontal bar, so that you can look at, and edit, two places in the same file (sort of) simultaneously. I vaguely seem to recall LibreOffice should also have had this kind of feature, and yet I can't find any UI for it with LO 6.0.3.1 (on GNU/Linux).
To activate it, I'm simply clicked: Window --> New Window and a second window opened with the same contents. When I save in one, the saved contents are replicated in the other. They are kept in sync, as far as I can tell.
