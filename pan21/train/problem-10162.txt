This file is very much present in the setup folder. It gives me an option to choose the correct path of this file, but when I browse and navigate to the folder containing this file, it doesn't show me the CAB file for selection.
While running Office 2007 Ultimate Setup on Windows 7 box, I get this error message - "Setup cannot find PowerPoint.en-us\PptLR.cab".
This is often caused by a trial version of Office 2007 being pre-installed on your machine. Check control panel, Programs, Uninstall a program and then uninstall everything with Office in it's name. After this you should be able to install both from the DVD and the HDD.
FYI, for comparison - on my Ultimate disk, the file has a creation date/time of 30/10/2006 02:33 and the size is 13,422,356  and has a CRC of 0xA98A52BE
Check the media for any scratches or problems. Next, try to open the CAB file yourself and see if it is readable.
What worked for me: I installed MS Office 13 (365) and uninstalled it after and installed MS Office 2010 again (without rebooting) and it worked as "charm"...
So if nothing helped you just try to install and uninstall MSO 13 (365) again and after install MSO 2010.
