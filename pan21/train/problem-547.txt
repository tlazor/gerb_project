When you get a DNS name, you can use any DNS record type, and you can have your name point to an IPv6 address and/or an IPv4 address.  Each IP address can be matched with any valid TCP port number (there are 65,536 TCP port numbers) and/or any valid UDP port number (there are 65,536 TCP port numbers).
e.g., one domain name can point to an IP address, and that address can use one port number for standard HTTP (typically TCP port 80), one port number for HTTPS (typically TCP port 443), one port for SMTP (typically TCP port 25), and one port for Submission (typically TCP port 587).  Such behavior is common.
Furthermore, if you have a domain name like example.com, you can control sub-domains, like nameone.example.com and nametwo.example.com and namethree.example.com, and have each sub-domain contain different AAAA and/or A records that point to different IP addresses.
DNS is really a question-and-answer type system.  Using TXT records, essentially anything can be communicated with DNS.  Using an SRV record, a port can be used.
However, the most common uses of DNS are likely for AAAA records (IPv6 addresses), A records (IPv4 addresses), CNAME records ("Canonical names", basically pointers to other names), and MX records ("mail exchange" records, identifying E-Mail servers.)
