In the setup you described you're going to end up with a pretty random read/write IO workload.  So I think you'll see a benefit from the higher IOPS that the faster drives are going to get you.
Spindle speed is more of a factor for reads and with a RAID-1 or RAID-10, the performance will benefit from load balanced reads.  Thus, I doubt you'll see much difference between two 5400 vs. two 7200s in this situation.
Spindle speed does not matter, for writes, if your RAID controller "assume a typical 3ware SATA controller" is assumed to be one with a fair amount of RAM.
Of course that last point assumes that the information density on each track is the same between the drives, which is not necessarily the case as two drives with the same total data capacity could have different numbers of platters, so you'll need to compare the drive options in a little more detail to get an answer you are more confident is correct.
While the head-movement latency is very similar, you will see differing performance from 7200 and 5400 RPM drives. The faster spin means that there will be a very small difference in the length of time that the heads wait for the right part of the track to be underneath once they are in the right position away from the spindle, and once they start reading then the blocks will pass by faster and so be read faster with the faster spinning drive giving a noticeable boost to peak transfer speeds.
If we limit this discussion to just the drives there are two main factors that influence the performance in these situations.  Drive rotational speed and the number of drives involved in any IO operation.  There are other factors but these two play the biggest role.  This is also one of the reasons why enterprise class drives are typically smaller and run at 10k or 15k rpm.  This plays into addressing both the rotational speed and number of spindles involved in any IO.
