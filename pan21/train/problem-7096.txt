I would use Resilio BTsync to simply backup/copy folders to another server, as you described. It works in a similar fashion to Dropbox, except for one major and very important difference: there is no "cloud" middleman. Data goes in folder/s on ServerA, it gets synced to ServerB. Simple and very effective. 
I have searched for similair solution and the easiest thing I have found was the http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp - free rsync-based solution. It contains sync server and client. Just execute server and set aliases for folders you're going to backup. Then setup client on backup machine and bind it to server's folders created before. It transfers only differences and can compress, so backup is rather fast, especially for low-speed connections.
DFS Replication uses a compression algorithm known as remote differential compression (RDC). RDC detects changes to the data in a file and enables DFS Replication to replicate only the changed file blocks instead of the entire file.
What you describe is very generic and can be done using array of solutions depending on your needs, from simple script using Robocopy to high end third party software.
The built in DFS replication sounds like it would work well for you.  Once set up, no need to script anything - just drop files in the replicated folder, and they will copy to remote (1 or many locations) per the setup.
   If trust is not already in place, adding it just for backup would not be a best idea from security point of view.
