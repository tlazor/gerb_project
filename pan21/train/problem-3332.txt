The past month or so I started opening these videos just to click on the thumb down icon and go away, hoping it would instruct YouTube to stop with this nonsense. Apparently this only made it worse and now I permanently have 2 or 3 "Aliens" videos right at the top of the home page in the Recommended section.
I get suggested channels and sets of videos recommended to me. You can find a [x] close icon to the upper right of those rows. I find this causes those suggestions to stop coming.
YouTube mainly ends up recommending the Search History and Watch History on a user's Channel. If you reset/clear both of these, you can pretty much reset your recommendations back to regular recommendations after which you'll be able to see only the Trendy Videos on the Home Page.
About six months or so ago YouTube started suggesting me videos about "Aliens". These are home made videos from folk that seem to see "aliens" everywhere: e.g., white dots in photos of the Moon mean the satellite is "crammed with aliens", Mimas is the death start from Star Wars and similar kind of nonsense.
I understand YouTube suggests content considering the my watched history. However, the vast majority of videos I watch are either on sports or politics. The only remote explanation would be a subscription to the PBS Space Time channel, but that is a science tube.
