I'm trying to PXE-boot a Cisco UCS C240 server to install a new OS over the network, but it isn't picking up an IP address via DHCP during boot. I get the "No DHCP or proxyDHCP offers were received" error from the Intel Boot Agent. A tcpdump on the DHCP server shows no DHCP-related packets were received on the DHCP server machine:
I had this similar problem after my WDS Server and Switch took a power hit. What I found out was the DNS setting in the Server\Options setup was NULL, so I had to put the DNS setting in, I also verified the other server options setting to see if they were nulled. 
I've seen Portfast (or the lack thereof) cause this. Enabling Portfast on the ports between the DHCP client and server resolved the problem for me.
What could cause DHCP to fail during the PXE boot process while succeeding when booted into the operating system? As far as I can tell, PXE is using the same network interface that Windows is. At least, the MAC address that is reported during PXE boot is the same as the MAC address that gets the IP via DHCP when Windows is up.
However, when I boot the machine into the installed operating system (in this case, Windows Server 2012), and configure that network interface for DHCP, it gets an IP address from the DHCP server. If I leave tcpdump running, I see the following:
I usually bypass the portfast requirement by making hosts do the extended memory check in the bios (not sure about Cisco but HP and IBM allow this setting) by the time the host boots to PXE everything is able to forward.  UEFI systems also seem to slow up the boot process.  I'm not saying the portfast option won't work but sometimes it's a tough sell to the "that's the way we do things" networking types.  This has worked everytime and everywhere I've tried it, without network intervention.
