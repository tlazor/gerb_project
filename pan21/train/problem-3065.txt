If you can't, I would go in to the BIOS and disable the network interface (if it is built in) and buy yourself a bog standard non Realtek card then see if you have better luck with that instead.
If you're on your own, it's a different story. You have many choices: change hardware, try building another kernel version, try debugging the issue yourself if you are skilled enough.
However, the NIC is still dropping connection when the link is under moderate load which is a real PITA for headless servers, which after all these boxes are designed for!
If you paid money for a computer that comes with a custom Linux distribution installed, bug the vendor. I believe it's their job to handle it or pass the bug report upstream.
I would advice anyone planning to run Linux on these boxes to look else where, since these boxes are very unstable on Linux. Better to buy some standard mini-atx setup since Compulab seems as interested in supporting Linux as ATI or FireDTV have been the past decade.
Simply put, you have narrowed it down to heavy networking use, so I would say, look for a different/better/newer network driver as the problem most likely lies there.

I got the exact same problem when I recompiled the Lenny stock kernel with Atom CPU and RTL8168c/8111c NIC enabled.
