As ''MarkM'' has noted there is some cost involved, but this is in the order of Â£60-100 if I recall correctly, have a peek at vmware.com/store for exact numbers -- compared with everything else that VMware sells (ESX, vCenter) it is dirt cheap and well worth the cash.
The installation process under Windows XP is 'n00b proof' and a simple point + click process. You'll want to get VMware Tools under all those virtual machines for a nicer experience :)
I don't think you really need a tutorial if you buy VMWare workstation, I was up and running in an hour and never looked at a manual very simple to get started.
I use to run about 15 workstations and servers in my home office to have the same type of flexibility I have now with one workstation. The savings in electricity alone paid for the $189 cost of the VMWare workstation in the first few months. I have almost zero issues, and it is very easy to setup and use. I have Vista, XP, NT4.0, NT2003, NT2008 SQL server 2000, 2005, 2008, and even on linux image all running on the same box at the same time.
The VMWare workstation, at less than $200, is an unbelievably awesome program. I purchase a highend workstation with 16G of RAM and RAID disks and now run upto a dozen different VM's at the same time for development purposes and the flexibility this type of setup provides is truly amazing.
If you're using this for business purposes then VMware Workstation makes a lot of sense, additional features like Teams allow you to fire up a QA environment with a couple of clicks.
