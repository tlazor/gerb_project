The application developer is more likely claiming that it's in his own best interest for you to cover his ass by working around the unprofessional job he did.  He may have stopped short of actually admitting that he wrote something with a whopping memory leak, but not very far short of it.
I have a script restart one of our webservers every night but that's more because of a poorly written java application rather than an industry standard. I would say that it isn't uncommon to restart the web services though. This might do the memory cleanup you're looking for and put less strain on the server as compared to a full restart.
While I agree it's not ideal to restart a server constantly, there are situations where it is neither the developer's fault nor the wrong thing to do. We have a well-behaved application that is leaking memory because of issues in the Python Popen library. It's an old application that will be retired soon, but it's business-critical. We have to keep it running with a minimum of fuss for our clients. So we've just decided to restart the server every night.
The most frequent I've ever seen is weekly.  Where I'm at now we're a windows shop, and we do it monthly over the weekend following Patch Tuesday.
