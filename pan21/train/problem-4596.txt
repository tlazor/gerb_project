Well, one more reason to use e.g. Nero to burn CD's: LightScribe support. Although at the site you could also just download free sooftware to do the same, just simpler...
A friend of mine had done a backup of family pictures on a CD, and his hard disk crashed, to the point he could not boot Windows anymore. And his two latest backups, done with Windows built-in CD burner, happened to be unreadable. I actually recovered his files from his hard disk using a Live Linux distro. We then re-installed everything back on his PC, knowing his pictures were safe. 
But since then, he uses Nero under Windows, with the option to verify all burned CDs, to ensure that the CD is readable. Nero may cost money, but you then have a much better insurance that your data is readable. 
When you use a CD to distribute information, or to provide a copy to others, a defective CD is not so much a problem, you can always re-do it. But when you rely on it as a backup, you need to ensure that what you burn is readable. 
One single reason to use another software such as Nero is that CD burning can be an imperfect process. If you use CD burning as your backup process, and you need to recover files, you want to make sure what you burn can be read back. To my knowledge, Windows built-in CD burning process does not actually provide a full verification of the burned data.
