Take a look at ServersAlive.  It's worked well for me in the past at monitoring a big range of services.
At a budget level, Idera's admin tool kit comes with a SQL Server ping function that will run every x minutes from the system tray - it's USD 295 per install.
If you have enterprise needs, Microsoft's SCOM will monitor availability and performance for SQL Server - and loads of other Microsoft/Wintel products as well. It's competitively priced. Other monitoring solutions are available from the likes of BMC, HP etc
Nagios is a well-liked monitoring system, and it comes with plugins for many aspects to monitor - eg memory, network, CPU, servers, etc.
Finally, why not try to script one yourself - a dedicated SQL Box, running SQL jobs to query other SQL Server's availability - and using database mail if there's a problem. 
Is there a tool that will automaticaly check all servers and their instances on the network or can an sql  script be coded to do this? 
Our daily checks involve checking all servers in our network for conectivity. At present we manually log on to each server and their instance to check.
