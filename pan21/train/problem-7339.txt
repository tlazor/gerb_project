Its a flash based website has lots of options, maybe too many for your users, but its pretty nice, and free.
I'm supporting some non-techie users on Windows XP who are occasionally required to upload images to a web content management system. The source images come in many forms: JPEG, TIFF, EPS, etc. Before they can be uploaded they need to be resized to the right dimensions, occasionally cropped, and saved in web-friendly formats.
Microsoft Paint. Honestly, it's a decent image editor considering it's built in. Cropping capabilities AND support for web-friendly formats (although BMP is the default).
Irfanview supports several image formats and is capable of resizing images to any required dimensions. It's pretty lightweight, and if you need additional formats to be supported, it has plug-ins that can be installed.
The computers they're using are a few years old and have 1GB of memory at best. A full featured editor like Photoshop or GIMP would not be a good option. I need something lightweight and easy to use.
