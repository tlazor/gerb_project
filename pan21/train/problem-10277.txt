Otherwise as soon as you connect it to the rest of your network (and revert your client devices to DHCP-assigned IP addresses) you may not be able to connect to it anymore, even though connecting and browsing through it would work (because in essence, it becomes a wireless switch connected to the rest of the network).
Remember that if you have conflicting (or non-matching) network addressing you will have to configure the AP to either obtain an IP address from your main router/modem's DHCP server (and then find out what that IP address is from your router or from a network scan of some sort).
Again, from the AP's manual it looks like its default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, so in order to connect to you'll have to assign a static IP within the same subnet, such as
Try to connect to the AP completely separately, i.e. disconnect the AP from anything else on your network, then reboot it.
From the device's manual it seems that by default its DHCP server is disabled, so you will have to manually assign an IP address to client devices in order to connect to it (this is probably the reason you cannot connect using a mobile device - did you manually assign an IP address to the mobile device before trying to open the admin page?).
