After making the change, you have to renew your DHCP lease as a way of getting the DHCP client to run so you can apply the change:
What are you trying to accomplish with the additional DNS? Are you trying to get to another resource? The answer is likely no, as workarounds like adding an entry to a host file, or creating a static route will be disabled if you are a standard user. 
Add to the end of that key any domains you want to add to your search list -- although this key may entirely replace your search list.  This list should be comma-separated with no whitespace.
While I'm not sure how Group Policy will interact with this, you can manually edit the registry value HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\SearchList to contain a comma separated (no spaces!) list of domain name suffixes that get appended to your DNS.
