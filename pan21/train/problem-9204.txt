Since your issue is not multiple IPs going to a single "All Unassigned" pointed site, is AAA.com set to use a Host Header, or is it just bound to that IP?  If both AAA.com and BBB.com are pointing to a single IP for that server, and you aren't using host headers, then they'll point to the same site.
By default the "Default Web Site" will fit the bill for what you're looking for, but perhaps you've changed its configuration to be bound to some IP address / host header combination other than "All Unassigned" with no host header specified.
If you have a particular site you want to redirect incoming requests to, just change the settings on the "Home Directory" tab of the "Default Web Site" (or whatever site you set up on "All Unassigned" with no host header) to be a "Redirection to a URL" and specify the URL in the "Redirect to" text-box.
IIS binds to 0.0.0.0, port 80 by default. Assuming you've assigned the IP addresses to the IIS machine, the web site bound to "All Unassigned" IP addresses, port 80, with no host header specified will answer for all access to IP addresses on the machine that don't otherwise correspond to an IP / host header combination assigned to another site.
