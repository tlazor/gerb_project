You can achieve either inequality for an appropriate choice of channels $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$, even under the additional assumption that the channels are perfectly distinguishable (meaning $\| \Phi_0 - \Phi_1 \|_{\Diamond} = 2$).
\sup_{\rho} \: \| (\Phi_0 \otimes \operatorname{Id}_k)(\rho) - (\Phi_1 \otimes \operatorname{Id}_k)(\rho) \|_1
If you don't have any additional assumptions on the channels, you cannot say too much about how these norms relate aside from these coarse bounds:
Also, this way of thinking shows that if the channels can be teleported deterministically (such as Pauli channels), then their diamond norm equals the Jamiolkowski trace distance.
J(\Phi) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1\leq i,j \leq n} \Phi(|i \rangle \langle j|) \otimes |i \rangle \langle j|.
Now, suppose that $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$ are quantum channels.  We may define the "diamond norm distance" between them as
I like to think of the first inequality that Watrous wrote in terms of probabilistic channel teleportation. If you interpret the diamond norm as a measure of the smallest error probability in discriminating channels $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$, and the trace norm as the equivalent for their Jamiolkowski states, you can always implement the optimal strategy for the channels from their corresponding states with $\frac{1}n$ success probability. Putting this rigorously may be a way of proving the inequality.
Here we are assuming that the channel maps $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ (i.e., $n\times n$ complex matrices) to $M_m(\mathbb{C})$ for whatever choice of positive integers $n$ and $m$ you like.  The matrix $J(\Phi)$ is sometimes called the Choi matrix or Choi-Jamiolkowski representation of $\Phi$, but it is more frequent that those terms are used when the $\frac{1}{n}$ normalization is omitted.
You might also want to look into Distance measures to compare real and ideal quantum processes arXiv:quant-ph/0408063 which gives an overview of distance measures for quantum channels and their relationships.
They use the term S distance for the diamond distance and J distance for the trace distance of the Jamio≈Çkowski operators associated to the channels.
(Note that the above definition does not work for arbitrary mappings, only those of the form $\Phi = \Phi_0 - \Phi_1$ for completely positive maps $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$.  For general mappings, the supremum is taken over all matrices with trace norm 1, as opposed to just density matrices.)
where $\operatorname{Id}_k$ denotes the identity channel from $M_k(\mathbb{C})$ to itself, $\| \cdot \|_1$ denotes the trace norm, and the supremum is taken over all $k \geq 1$ and all density matrices $\rho$ chosen from $M_{nk}(\mathbb{C}) = M_n(\mathbb{C}) \otimes M_{k}(\mathbb{C})$.  The supremum always happens to be achieved for some choice of $k\leq n$ and some rank 1 density matrix $\rho$.
rather than taking the supremum over all $\rho$.  The first inequality is a bid tougher, but it would be a reasonable assignment question for a graduate course on quantum information.  (At this point I should thank you for your question, because I fully intend to use this question in the Fall offering of my quantum information theory course.)
