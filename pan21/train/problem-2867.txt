Also interesting - I couldn't verify the Nagios config as suggested in those instructions because /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios doesn't exist. Not sure what's happened to that.
If I create an empty pid file then try starting the service again I get an error saying it contains an invalid value, then it gets deleted.
After that service nagios start hangs for several minutes, then claims to have timed out. Despite this, Nagios seems to be running.
That /var/nagios/nagios.pid file doesn't exist. Initially, the /var/nagios directory didn't exist, so I created it. I've tried changing its owner to nagios and I've tried changing its owner to root.
The answer to this appeared to be re-running the various make install-* commands. I didn't see any errors during the first install, but it looks like some aspects failed anyway - most notably the missing /usr/local/nagios/bin directory.
Having followed the instructions here http://linoxide.com/how-tos/install-configure-nagios-centos-7/ (but downloading Nagios 4.0.2 instead of 4.0.7 - I have to use that version), I have reached a point where the Nagios service won't start.
