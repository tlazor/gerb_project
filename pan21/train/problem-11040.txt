Yet the old CRT that if dropped from 3 feet onto a human being would crush him is still functioning correctly, and still works perfectly. Do I still use it? No, not unless I need an emergency monitor to check on a server that is for some unknown reason crashing.
If the monitor is still good enough for your needs and if it can be fixed for an acceptable price, then why not?
The components in a monitor do not age well, just like they don't age well in computers. They are just not made like they used to be made. In the past three years I have gone through a multitude of monitors and even fixed several monitors myself (when a cap goes bad, the wrong signal is sent to the backlight, replace the cap and it is all good again).
I would suggest going with a new monitor, get one with a LED based backlight, there is less electronics involved in powering it and as such it is less likely that it will break and or cause you trouble down the line.
The thing you have to worry about with the older monitor is that eventually the picture is going to start looking weaker (the backlight is not as bright) the pixels are not going to be as responsive, the picture is going to look washed out.
