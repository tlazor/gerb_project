I had a similar problem. I had added an extra primary partition and an extended partition to my second disk drive using Windows Disk Manager - 4 partitions in total. After that I could no longer boot up Windows and none of the repair options would work.
I have an MSI Z77-G65A board. It is configured for UEFI boot, booting from the SSD. Both drives are set as independent HDs (no accidently activated RAID). The SSD is connected to a SATA-6G port and the old drive to a SATA-3G port.
I have recently installed Windows 7 64 bit on a new SSD using UEFI boot and GPT. The system worked fine. After adding my old system HD to the system (that uses MBR), Windows will no longer boot correctly: When booting from the SSD, the normal boot screen appears and Windows tells me that it is loading files. Then the boot screen disappears and I am in an EFI shell, unable to boot. When I unplug the old HD, Windows boots again without complaints.
My solution was to use the diskpart command running from an Emergency Repair Disk to convert the second disk drive from MBR to GPT. In hindsight when I installed Windows I only formatted the first disk drive (an SSD) which must have defaulted to GPT. I formatted the second drive using Windows Disk Manager and the software must default to MBR.
I am glad I found this post as it identifies the problem as being in the software, and not in one of my two disk drives or the motherboard.
