Couldn't you delete the files from a shell? You can show all files with ls -la ~/Google\ Drive and delete the Icon\r file with rm ~/Google\ Drive/Icon*. find ~/Google\ Drive -name .DS_Store -delete deletes all .DS_Store files. I'm not sure if that would fix the syncing issue though.
I have all my folders visible right now in Snow Leopard. I just put an alias to Google Drive app on my desktop and immediately copied some files over that synced correctly. Now, I notice that '.icon' and '.DS_Store' files are in the Drive folder with the 'syncing' icon next to them. I tried to sync some more files (.mp4) and it has been about two hours and they are not syncing along with the hidden files still showing 'syncing'. The only option I have found is maybe to create an automator script that runs the terminal command to hide/unhide files and add it into context menu and use it every time I need it. That seems REALLY inefficient and annoying. There has to be a way to just unhide stuff in this one folder...
