In addition to the existing answers, a clean OS install of Windows 10 is somewhere around 10 GB, depending on what exactly is installed. I did even manage to get it down to 7 GB once. This will grow over time as patches are applied, browsers build up huge caches on disks, and logs grow. When space gets scarce, Windows will do some cleanup on its own, and let the user know to run Disk Cleanup (right click on the drive->Properties).
I've just done a clean install of Windows 10 and Office 365 on a 32GB HP Stream 7 and it's taking 13.9GB including about 400MB of my OneDrive files. It also supports a 32GB SD card (rumour has it that 64GB also works) which on Windows 10 can be used for personal folders and applications.
If you run Disk Cleanup, and also click "Clean up system files", then check all the boxes, your Windows folder will become considerably smaller than 32 GB.
Additionally, any program you install stores a footprint directly in the Windows Directory, in folders like Windows/Installer, or Windows/InfusedApps/Packages.
Windows 10 uses compress boot which free's up 2-3GB. Windows 10 install using compress boot will only take up 7-9GB. Also there is no longer a need to make a separate partition for the recovery image which will free up an additional 4GB.
