You could also say: If no entry in the routing table was matching, you know that the destination must be in the internet.
The computer will first look up all entries in the routing table. If one entry matches (e.g. when sending a packet to 10.0.1.15), the information from that entry will be used.
However, if the destination is in the internet, there is no entry in the routing table. After checking all entries of the routing table, the sending computer will use the default gateway because no entry was matching.
Please note that in the subnet 10.0.1.x things are easier: "D" can be the default gateway and the routing table needs not to contain any entries for 10.0.2.x and 10.0.3.x because the router "D" is used both for packets to the internet and for packets to 10.0.2.x and 10.0.3.x.
If the destination is in the range 10.0.2.x, the routing table contains the information  that the packet can "directly" be sent to the destination.
If the destination is in the ranges 10.0.1.x or 10.0.3.x, the routing table contains the information about the router (gateway) to be used: Either router "A" or router "B".
