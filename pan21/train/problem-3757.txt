For your average home or business user, this might prove difficult, which is where your local independent repair shop comes in. Yes, you'll have to pay for labour on top of the replacement parts, but unless you have your own resources, you have no choice. 
It could be one of many components, but it is likely to be the RAM/CPU/PSU/Motherboard (in no particular order).
If you have access to some spare components or a someone else's similar machine, you can possibly isolate the problem yourself. The first task is to test one stick of RAM in another machine. If the RAM is good, leave it (on it's own) in your machine, leave the CPU and the PSU connected, but remove all other RAM/cards/disks/peripherals. If this allows you PC to at least 'turn-over', your RAM may well be the problem.
Likewise, if the problem remains, you need to either test each of the other main components either by proving them in another machine, or by replacing them with a spare one. Be sure to use compatible components for testing - that is, if you try to cannibalise another machine to test this one, make sure that they use similar components. The specification in your user guide should indicate this, or otherwise seek specific information from your OEM.
Nobody can diagnose your problem over this forum, and implementing all the suggestions you will get here will cost you much more than the repairman will.
