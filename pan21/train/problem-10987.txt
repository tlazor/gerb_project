In the cases where the clearly defined RBACs are insufficient and root/Administrator/etc. access is required, the admin requests access, after approval by the security operations team (four eyes principle, audit trail with change/incident number) and via the password vault an SSH or RDP is started with the correct credentials from the vault. The admin does not receive a cleartext copy of the password stored in the vault. The SSH or RDP session can be monitored and is recorded for the desired audit trail. After the session is closed the vault application will change the password again. 
For specific systems the password management of all privileged accounts is handed over to an external password vault application and even the administrators don't know the root/Administrator/DB-owner etc. passwords.  
The risk you run (actually the reality) is that resolution of incidents and even scheduled work will take significantly longer, but at least you'll have an excellent audit trail of why so!
Of course the actual security of such procedures depend to large extend on the quality and security consciousness of your configuration management, event monitoring and general maturity of your operations team. 
At the site of my current employer one of the many security measures in place are break glass accounts which can only be accessed using a privileged session monitor that records all activity.
