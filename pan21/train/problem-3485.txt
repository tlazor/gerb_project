This is not the fault of the OS as any flavour of Windows will exhibit these symptoms; the only variant of Linux I tried to install refused to do so and just hung midway. I've paved the system on about a half-dozen occasions now and still the issue persists.
Check your machine for dust. Dust is a fantastic thermal insulator and also keeps fans from running as well as they should, and is therfor one of the most common reasons of machines overheating. This is especially, but not only, true for systems with either limited airflow or limited space, such as small form towers or laptops. Depending on the environment you run your computer in, it will accumulate a lot of dust over time.
I have an older desktop (i7-920, 2.66 GHz) which I built a number of years ago but have noticed that it now spontaneously reboots (with differing error messages).
I'm trying to isolate what it is could be causing the issue so I'm running MemTest86+ on it as I type this on another machine. The first thing I notice is (according to MemTest) is that the CPU is running between 70째C and 75째C. According to this page here the temperature range for this processor is 5째C-67.9째C
Open up your machine and clean everything that seems overly dusty. Places that are especially prone to collecting dust are fans and heatsinks, such as on your graphics card or on your CPU. Carefully remove large amounts of dust and see if your machine goes back to running with normal temperatures.
This is a secondary machine with my main one being a laptop, this one's just used because of the space and also as a place to host a share of development VMs. 
Could this be causing the reboots? Is there likely some damage done to the processor already and am I as well not trusting it anymore?
