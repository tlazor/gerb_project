I have recently build a new machine with XFX ATi Radeon 5830 for GPU. I have an Asus LCD VH236H monitor which supports 1080p resolution yet when I have it set to the recommended 1080p resolution the screen is not entirely filled up. There is ~1cm (on top and bottom) and ~1.5cm (on right and left side) black frame. I would like to use the LCD's actual size to the fullest but I cannot do it when I use HDMI, unless there is something I am missing. Should I use DVI instead? Any help will be really appreciated. Thanks
If that options screen isn't there, the black borders probably aren't coming from the ATI driver. Instead, try different options in your monitor's on-screen menu. 
Possibly you may need to open your monitors settings, although with new monitors it might be different. Just press the button on the monitor, and usually you can stretch it to fill the empty space. 
While connected via HDMI and running at your intended resolution, go into the Catalyst Control Center and find Scaling Options under Digital Flat Panel. Move the slider to the right.
Have you tried DVI?  If DVI resolves the problem (which it probably will), then use it instead.  I've found that HDMI doesn't always work as expected.
