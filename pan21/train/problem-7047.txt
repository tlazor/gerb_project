I have a Toshiba laptop that is no longer receiving power when it's plugged in.  How can I tell if problem is in the AC adapter or in the actual laptop?
Any opinion on the chances that it is something internal in my laptop or in the AC adapater w/o buying a new adapter?
You need a multimeter. Without it, there is nothing you can do. So first step is to plug the supply in and connect probes of the meter to the inner and outer connections of the supply. You should get around 19 V, if I'm reading the info on the site correctly.  
I'd suggest using a voltmeter / multimeter. You can get inexpensive ones at your local Radio Shack. What you would do is set the voltmeter to 20V and then use the volt meter leads to touch the metal parts of AC adapter connector. Written on the the AC adapter is its voltage output, and the reading you get from the voltmeter should be very close to that value. If you get a reading that's close to zero, that AC adapter is either not working or you're not touching the connector correctly.
If you get good voltage, then it's very likely that it's working correctly. If you want to be sure and know someone good with electronics, you could try putting some load on the supply. The voltage should not change even under load. Still, it could be complicated to make proper resistor network, so don't try it if you don't know what you're doing.
I could buy a replacement adapter (this is the one), but I don't know if that is actually the problem.
I agree with the method of testing Adapter with Multi/volt meter but in many cases (if the fault persists in the Adapter) without the load it is meaning less. You certainly need to put a Dummy-Load to get the proper response.
