I've seen a few cases where the NIC seemingly randonmly "goes to sleep" because it decides it's time to save some power.
It can have relationship with UPnP. Windows 7 use it for discover network. Try use non windows firewall to block upnp, i think it is UDP packet port 80 and not authorized incoming connections.
i have a win 7 machine with an Atheros L1 Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000Base-T Controller with latest drivers, the machine is upto date with all latest fixes etc. I have it connecting to a WRT310Nv2 router. Seemingly random, win 7 disconnects from the "Home Network" says its in a "public network", then resets the connection to an illegal 169 address. I have tried static ips, dhcp, all with the same results. This seems to have started shortly after i installed Vuze, so I uninstalled it but the problem persists. I know that the router is sound given that I have an XP machine attached with no issues of connectivity at all. I am at a complete loss and have tried everything, pleasse tell me i'm not the only one.
Is this the only NIC?  In other words, is this a laptop with a wireless NIC as well as a wired NIC or a desktop with only wired NIC?
Does this happen when you connect to a different port on the router - preferably one you know is good?
I haven't seen the behavior that you describe, but you might want to check through the advanced settings for your driver in the Device Manager to make sure you don't have any power-saving settings enabled for the NIC.
