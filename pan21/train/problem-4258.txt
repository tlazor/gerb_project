As long as the mailbox can still be accessed via PowerShell, you can run Get/Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration.  This will not cover a use case of a sender sending the departed user more than one email per day. You can set a different message for internal vs. external senders, as well as disabling external senders from getting an OOO message.
My suggestion is to draft the message as you like in MS Word, save as HTML, and import the HTML file into a variable in PowerShell.  $extmsg = get-content C:\filepath\file.html  Then you can call in the $extmsg variable when assigning the AutoReply content in your Exchange cmdlet.  Word makes very "bulky" HTML files, but you can easily ensure mailto and url links work properly.
Disabling an AD account should not destroy the mailbox, but removing an assigned license subscription can.  Depending on your tenant plan, you should put the user on hold before deprovisioning the account from O365.  This will keep the mailbox data for the duration of the hold.
