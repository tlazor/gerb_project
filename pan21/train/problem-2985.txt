Normally, the traceroute will use ICMP message. If we use the TCP or UDP message, the traceroute can't know the services running on the destination computer, which means it's hard to determine the port in TCP or UDP message. But the ICMP message should be OK if there is no firewall blocking the ICMP message.
Having said that, there is no guarantee that the route you get from traceroute is the same as your application is using.  This can be for several reasons (probably more than a dozen, if you count obscure cases), including:
And, by the way, your comment "different operating systems may use different packet types" is incorrect.  Every system connected to The Internet uses all those packet types, you can't operate on the net without them.
If there is a load balancer between your computer and the destination computer, the path may be different because the traceroute and the browser are using two sessions.(It depends on the rules on load balancer.)
If you don't already understand IP Routing, then the results from traceroute will not tell you anything.  The route between two nodes over the wider Internet can change from second to second.  And the route in one direction is not the same as the return route.  And that's not even accounting for the fact that the specific case you mention uses a CDN, meaning that not only can the route change, but the actual machines you are talking to can be different.
