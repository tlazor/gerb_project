The subtree_check option tells the NFS server to take into account the path on the filesystem when checking its exports for any action. This is typically required when exporting directories along a tree sitting on a sole filesystem. Without this the NFS server will serve requests from the first export record matching the filesystem holding the path targeted by client's NFS commands.
Replace no_subtree_check with subtree_check. Make sure fsid doesn't conflict with the parent export.
This does not work as expected: It mounts fine, but I see the contents of /mnt/datastore/, not /mnt/datastore/dev/ which defeats the purpose of this exercise.
A sub-directory in this export, /mnt/datastore/dev/ is where I store all the source trees for development work I'm busy with. I have a dedicated VM that I do development on and as such I want to mount this export on it. For safety purposes I am just interested in mounting the subdirectory mnt/datastore/dev/ so that when I mess up, I do not erase my entire collection of movies and TV series.
