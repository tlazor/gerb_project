To avoid the plug-in, just save the pdf file to your hard drive and open it directly in Adobe Reader. You can configure this in Opera too by going to "Ctrl + F12 -> Advanced -> Downloads -> application/pdf -> edit" and setting it to "open with default application". That will cause pdf files to open directly in the Adobe Reader app, which will totally avoid the problem.
Then, try printing. But, make sure you don't print from print preview as that can cause even more bugs.
Note though that even though setting "Scale print to" to 100% makes Opera print things at the proper size, it may cause blank pages. You can trying manually typing in 94% for example to see if you can find a percentage that gets rid of the blank pages but still looks nice.
Opera's printing support is super buggy and always has been. But, it gets worse with each release. Regressions are almost never fixed.
With that said, you're better off just right-clicking on the page and choosing a different browser under the "Open with" menu and printing in that. (IE prints way better than any other browser in almost all cases.)
However, in your case, it's the Adobe Reader plug-in itself that's embedded in a page in Opera. The plug-in is what does the printing of the pdf. If the plug-in isn't printing correctly while loaded in Opera, then it's probably a bug in Opera. But, note that the Adobe Reader plug-in is known for being buggy itself.
You can also try installing Foxit Reader and its browser plug-in. Opera will automatically recognize that plug-in. But, you should goto opera:plugins in the address field and disable the adobe one. Then, edit the application/pdf file type and set the drop-down under "use plug-in" to use the Foxit plugin. This plug-in works fine in Opera.
