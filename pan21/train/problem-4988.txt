I've been having issues running anything in SQL Management Studio on Win 7. Basically, doing anything through the Management Studio interfaces completely freezes it up for a few minutes. Running a query is nearly impossible because it takes nearly 2 minutes just for the IDE to parse it and another minute to run it when the query itself completes instantaneously outside of the IDE. I'm not even going to go into the query designer. Anything with heavy user interaction such as editing a row in the result set where i have to click a cell freezes up the front-end. I tried reinstalling to no avail. Also tried running in compatibility mode without any difference whatsoever. Anybody had a similar experience?
Are any events recorded in event manager?  Any other network related tasks slow?  if you have other devs in your area and it works for them and they have rights to login to your pc try this as it may be a profile related issue.
