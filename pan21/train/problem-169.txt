The first thing goat jumps out to me is all the unnecessary nesting.  You are doing a good job of returning from the function as quickly as possible, but then still leave a bunch of unnecessary else code paths. If you return in the if. The else should not be there. Remove them and de-nest your code. You will also find this would eliminate need to check for function or regex multiple times.
Outside of the other answers about the general utility of this function, I figured I would add some additional thoughts on the code itself. I do agree with those other opinions though that this function just seems to obfuscate your code behavior. 'typeof' is so universally used and understood, that I don't know why you would want to introduce this potential point of complexity and confusion.
I do not understand why you would return lowercase first characters in your return values. If your are testing "Object" for example why return "object"?  This especially seems odd when your very last line of code for the fall through use case does not apply this same pattern.
