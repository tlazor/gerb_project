Hopefully you've long since replaced the drive, but since no one has yet directly answered the question...
You ran two tests, both of which failed to read the same logical sector of the disk, as indicated by Completed: read failure and the same LBA in both tests. This does indeed indicate the disk has a defect, and you should be able to have it replaced under warranty. Attempting to store data in this sector may or may not cause the drive to notice it's defective during the write process and remap the sector, but if the drive doesn't notice, and can't read the data later on, you've lost it.
The drive was likely on its way out.  Being unable to read from part of the drive is most definitely a failure condition, and it is certainly possible for it to happen without other typical signs of disk failure.  This type of thing isn't commonly transient; with no other signs it might be a weak head, a very slight alignment issue, or a defective area on a platter (cylinder?).
The smartmontools package also contains some sample scripts that smartd can call when something starts failing.
You don't need to make a cron script, there is a smartd daemon in the smartmontools package that handles just what you want to do: regular checking of SMART status. All you need is to create a configuration and start the service.
Anytime you see any error at all from SMART, it is a strong sign that you should get a new drive to avoid data loss.  It's intended as an early warning system, in part.
The other alternative is that there was a SMART bug; you really don't want to be running a drive with buggy firmware.
