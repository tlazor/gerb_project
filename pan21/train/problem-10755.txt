reimaging the server to the new hardware is definitely the way to go here, but before you do that, I would also run sys-unconfig. In short - it's a sysprep for RHEL derivative Linux distros.
As a virtual machine, though, you get more flexibility in copying and re-deploying your system later on if you wish to do more with it down the road.
If not, then pop a live CD into the destination system and set up filesystems to be identical to how they are on the origin host. If the systems are on the same network and you trust that noone's going to snoop, then use FTP to copy every file onto the new host, otherwise use SFTP or SCP. One thing you're going to want to check is /etc/fstab to make sure that any disk labels mentioned can be referenced by label.
Normally I look at using either DD over Netcat or Partimage to image systems, but you left a comment saying that you don't have physical access to the box. This complicates things as you can't image anything without risking data inconsistency (unless you have all the data in a separate partition that can be unmounted).
If the target disk is at least as big as the origin disk, then you can hook them both up on the same system. then do dd /dev/sda /dev/sdb, assuming sda is the origin and sdb is the target.
One possibility is to try turning it into a virtual machine. The VMWare Converter will create an image of a running Linux system without any trouble (from when I converted a bulletin board system to a virtual machine on an ESXi system). I just had to adjust the network system (Ubuntu) after converting.
