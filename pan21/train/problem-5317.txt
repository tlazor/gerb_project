Of course, this is by no means a comprehensive list(more so since I'm a beginner myself), but I feel its a good one to start with. It certainly helped me. Hope it does help you too!

The nice thing about Linux is that almost everything is configurable, and the system does not try to get in your way. It takes a bit getting used to (like everything new), but im optimistic you'll like it :-).
I'd advise you to just install and use Linux for a while. You know the saying: we retain 20% of what we hear, 50% of what we see and and up to 90% of what we do.
