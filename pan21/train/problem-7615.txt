Given that it is the nginx worker processes that are being killed how many do you have? I think by default it is the number of cores you have but it can be configured. Since the workers have their own memory pool the more works you have the more memory you will use. If you are using php-fpm you might want to look at the number of worker that uses as well as they share the same problem as the nginx workers.
You are running out of memory and being hit by the OOM Killer in an attempt to stop your system crashing.
You can use tools like free, top or htop (slightly nicer version of top) to see how much memory you are using and which applications are using most of it to help give you an idea of where the problems might be and if the changes you make are actually helping.
The OOM Killer is a bit random, but is weighted by the amount of memory a process uses so if you see a lot of nginx worker processes being killed then they are likely responsible for the memory usage.
Raspberry pi images also don't come with swap space (but can be configured to have some) which can give you more effective memory before the OOM Killer kicks in. Swap space would be most useful if you occasionally spike in memory usage or have a lot of generally unused memory, otherwise it tends to hamper performance and can reduce the life of your sd card.
