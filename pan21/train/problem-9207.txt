I have never heavily configured my Apache setup at all. I only use Apache to host an ownCloud and Gitlab server, but Apache's taking the two most unblocked ports: 443 and 80. I want to use Apache to redirect all traffic from a subdirectory (mysite.com/ssh for example) and redirect everything to localhost:22. The solution must work with no configuration on anything but Apache. I simply want all requests sent to mysite.com/ssh then to mysite.com:22 and then the ssh server only sees a request from 127.0.0.1. This should theoretically allow an ssh connection when all ports but 80 and 443 are blocked. Is this possible? 
The SSH client would have to encapsulate all SSH traffic into HTTP / HTTPS requests to the web server. The server side proxy would have to expand the traffic, and pass it to the SSH server on the box.
No, it is not possible. When you make a request to http(s)://mysite.com/ssh, the request is always made using HTTP / HTTPS protocol.
If you want to listen for both  HTTPS  and SSH protocols on port 443, you need to use software like http://www.rutschle.net/tech/sslh.shtml or https://github.com/stealth/sshttp . You can not do this with Apache alone for reasons Tero already explained.
