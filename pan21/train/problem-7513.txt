You can notice that the if blocks are still repetitive. You can use a dictionary to store the shipping costs.
I also used a list instead of a tuple to check for endProgram since it's more idiomatic. I don't think there's much more to do at this point to reduce size. You could find a smarter way to compute the shipping cost (see Kolmogorov complexity) but that would  make it harder to change the rules for no good reason. The block which compute amountCategory isn't too nice but since ifs are not expressions in Python you can't write amountCategory = if ...: 'lessFifty' else: 'free'. You could use a function if you wanted.
First make sure the script work: proper indenting, shebang, correct logic. When the user enters 170$, you give him free shipping only because twoHundred evaluates to totalAmount which evaluates to true, so it seems simple to just say "otherwise, it's free". You also don't handle errors. I decided to handle the "wrong country" error, but many things could go wrong when inputing the total amount. As other said, first separate printing from application logic:
