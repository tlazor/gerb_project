I would, if there are anything related, make, for ex, a SUM or other resume in each sheet, and in the new sheet make a cross reference for that field on each separated spreadsheet.to consolidate the data, without copying the whole data to just one sheet. If you are a good programmer the first solution for copying it may help, but it is not that simple, you'll see.
I have an Excel workbook with several worksheets. They all have the same column names. However, the number of rows differs from sheet to sheet. I want to create an overview sheet where I can see all the data from every single sheet. I could go in every sheet an just copy&paste the data from the second row to the last row with data in every sheet. But I think there is a easier way to do this?
You can take a look at this solution (Consolidate data by position), you'll see it's the similar overhead:
And last, but not least, if each sheet grows in row numbers, make sure, the SUM or whatever else be on the topmost and rightmost, so the sheet grows but the consolidate data don't get affected.
I see no advantage in doing this. I can't tell what you have to do, but if you divided the data on the several sheets, you must have a reason to do that. If you have a reason, why join then together ? It makes no sense to me.            All right, what I would do is, why do I need to see then in the first place, all together ? It just makes it difficult to find anything, Wait, yes, only if you want to use the edit function to locate specific data on it. But, do you have to do it many times ?
