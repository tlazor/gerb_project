Jaywalking your Dog - Computing the Fr√©chet Distance with Shortcuts by Anne Driemel and Sariel Har-Peled at SODA 2012.
The paper by Yonatan Bilu, Dana Porrat and Yoav Yaffe "On The Number of Condoms at a Cheap Safe-Sex Orgy". This paper was not published, so it doesn't correspond to one of the requirements (to be published work). But I think it can be included here as an exception.
blog posts ok? its "published" in a sense & blogs are increasingly mainstream and many now written by senior/elite researchers. just recently ran across this old, imaginative entry from last April 1 from the Algorithmic Game Theory Blog, with clever resemblance to real events. see comments for colorful feedback. eg MacArthur fellow Terence Tao comments
"Why ordinals are good for you" by I. Lepper and G. Moser. The paper itself is not intended to be humorous but it contains some funny quotes. I would be curious to see a similar introductory paper to the surreal numbers, a superclass of the ordinals introduced by J.H. Conway.
