I found it by searching on wireless, selecting turn wireless devices on and off and the option for Bluetooth was there. 
P.S. My Bluetooth USB dongle is listed in Device manager as a Generic Bluetooth Radio made by Cambridge Sillicon Radio.
Usually, bluetooth settings not properly appearing under "PC and devices" is a driver issue.  I'd recommend going to the Bluetooth USB dongle manufacturer's website and downloading/installing the latest drives for Windows 8.
I have recently purchased a cheap Bluetooth USB dongle from a local shop and plugged it in into my freshly installed Windows 8.1 Pro laptop, as it did not come with a Bluetooth adapter installed. All went good, I have a Bluetooth icon in my taskbar, but unfortunately a toggle to switch Bluetooth on/off in PC Settings - PC and devices - Bluetooth was not added. I would really like to have the option to switch the Bluetooth device on/off from there. Also, airplane mode does not disable Bluetooth, just Wi-Fi. Please tell me the steps needed to have this toggle available in PC settings...
