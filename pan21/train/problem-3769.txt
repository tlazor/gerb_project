By using the synchronized local account, the Win2003 machine can connect to the Win2008 server via RDC, can read the remote Application Event Log, etc.  
So somehow the 2008 machine can tell whether I'm impersonating the local account on the 2003 machine.  How can it do this?  How can I get the 2008 machine to let me in when logged in as a domain account but use the local account credentials?
I have a Win2008 server that is not in a domain.  I have two Win2003 machines, one in the domain, one not.  All of them have a local account named "testAdmin" with the same password on all three.
If I login to the Win2003 domain-attached machine with a domain account, and then try to connect to the Win2008 machine, no dice (expected -- 2008 isn't part of the domain).  However, if I use the Windows Event Log Viewer, and try to connect to the Win2008 machine, giving the synchronized local account and password, it still doesn't work (access denied).
The IPC$ attach works -- it shows up in a blank NET USE command.  However, if I try and look at the Win2008 Event Log, I still get access denied.
