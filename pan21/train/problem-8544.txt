I would first try searching for VESA plate adapters on Google. That turns up this site which might have what you need. I don't really know the model of the monitor that you want to mount, but a search for any VESA adapters should get what you're looking for.
There are some adapters, these do not come with an arm this just makes them vesa compatible here is an amazon list. Not alot of people use them.

Mark the attachment point on the back of your monitor and use some course sandpaper to score the surface of your monitor.
If I was you, the best thing you can do is buy a VESA mount monitor. If your monitor is from 2003, you will most likely be able to get a second hand monitor of higher specification that has a VESA mount for cheaper than any adapter/harness/whatever that you can buy.
The ARMs will never come off without tearing out the backs of the monitors, but the monitors are dedicated to a particular use in my sound studio and that is where they will stay. Food for thought before you mount the metal ARMs on your monitors . . . just saying.
After this, I am sorry, there just isn't a way I have seen apart from ugly harnesses that go around the entire monitor.
