In terms of fixing your problem, all I can suggest is to move the FTP server onto a DC or a non-domain server, but I guess neither of these options would be too attractive :-(
Note that the virtual directory did work on the DC when using the logged in user, while in your case it didn't. However I've noticed that DCs tend to be oblivious to the "host" bit of the username "host\user", presumably because there is no SAM on a DC, so I wouldn't attach too much significance to this. The member server is presumably passing the logged on username as "domain\user" and you're non-DC server is rejecting it.
This is indeed an odd one. I setup the config you describe with IIS running on a DC not a member server and the virtual directory configured to use the logged on user. This worked. Then I tried it with IIS running on a non-domain server, and it worked as well. Sadly IIS running on a domain member server is the one config I can't test.
I fired up Network Monitor to have a look, and when the virtual directory on the DC is configured to use the non-DC PC's administrator account the DC attempted to make an anonymous connection. It made no attempt to use the nondomainpc\administrator username that I had configured for the virtual directory. This looks like a bug to me.
I then configured the virtual directory to connect as nondomainpc\administrator. On the DC this did not work, but on non-domain server it did.
