The net result of this configuration is any/all requests to the site serve my maintenance page's content. It doesn't matter what the request is.
Also, be aware that IIS will affect this change by generating a web.config file in the root folder. This is what it created for me:
I know this is old, but I just had to do this on an old Windows 2008 r2 box. This is an answer more for the question title; regarding the question detail, it is then simply one approach to setting up a "We're Offline site in IIS".
This doesn't rely on anything more than IIS and static HTML. IIS's "HTTP Redirect" functionality doesn't handle what you want, but there's another way to simulate it. Just change all of the "Error Pages" for the site to point to the maintenance page. Yes, this works only if you can use an entire "site" in IIS. 
In my case, the site has a single "default.htm" file in its root folder (e.g. c:\InetPub\wwwroot). So all of the "Error Pages" are configured to "Execute a URL at this site" and use the path "/default.htm". Since I use absolute URLs (i.e. starting with "/") in the file, its content executes correctly in the browser, no matter what the public URL appears to be.
