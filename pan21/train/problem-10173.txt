I'm trying to ssh into a CentOS server which I have no control over.. the admin has added my public key to the server and insists the fault lies with me but I can't figure out what is wrong.
The reason in my case was a customly set option AuthorizedKeysFile in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. It was set to another user's home dir (/home/webmaster/.ssh/authorized_keys), so the user I was trying to log in had no access to that file/directory.
Also encountered this problem. setroubleshoot did not seem to work in my environment so there were no such log record in /var/log/messages.
AuthorizedKeysFile ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, which was on the server that wasn't accepting my keys. Obviously looking between the two files and noting the comment that states the default search patterns do not include the leading ~/ I removed it and restarted sshd. Problem solved.
Just in case this also saves someone. I was trying to copy a key from my Ubuntu 18.04 Machine to 2 CentOS 7 Servers. I used ssh-copy-id to transfer them. One worked, one didn't. So I went through all the permissions debugging and found nothing. So finally I pulled up the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config on both servers and stepped line by line through them. Finally I found it, probably something that someone modified long before I got on the job.
After changing it and restarting ssh-server (service ssh restart) everything came back to normal. I can log in by my private key now.
