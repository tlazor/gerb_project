Having more space available means that the OS can "leave" more applications in a state that allows them to resume faster and having to write less data to the hard disk.
Those are very general statements, but as you didn't mention your specific needs, your hardware configuration or what you wanted to buy exactly, I can only say that upgrading RAM will definitely increase performance and $90 are most certainly worth it.
Upgrading from 2Gib to 4Gib makes a world of difference because you can have a lot more apps open at the same time.
If you want to run RAM-hungry applications like video or audio editing, then the change will be even more drastic.
Upgrading your RAM is one of the cheapest ways to get a performance boost from a middle-aged system.
However, upgrading from something like 8Gib to 16Gib is not going to make a whole lot of difference unless you run Photoshop, a video editor, and a whole bunch of other apps at the same time.
Windows has a feature called "Windows User Experience" that tells you the "experience score" of each component of your machine - RAM, graphics, processor, etc. This is a great feature and you should create the same picture mentally.
From command line you can use vm_stat. Pageouts and Pageins are the most interesting statistic. It tells you how often you had to write/load a page to/from swap. Ideally with enough RAM it should be zero. 
So, if you have a "normal" (non-SSD) hard disk, you are most probably going to notice increased performance, especially when you switch application context a lot â€“ or like to keep many applications open at the same time.
Upgrading from 2 GB RAM to 4 GB is a good upgrade, but anything more than 4 will do nothing on a 32-bit processor. If you have the weakest processor, it will also be worthless. Bear things like this in mind. Compare with the rest of your specs.
