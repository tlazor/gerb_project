I'm trying to use the hosts file for testing stuff on my local network without it going to the live site on the internet. At the same time I want to be able to use dns on the normal internet.
I've read that the hosts file is ignored in XP SP2 if DNS Client service is running. I have tried this on my XP machine and it seems to be true. I can see how it is a security danger to have a hosts file that user programs could modify. If it could write to hosts, then any malware could spoof dns locally with minimal difficulty. 
The Hosts file is always queried first. If a site can't be resolved using the hosts file, Windows looks to the DNS server.
I've seen a number of articles about how to edit the hosts file in Windows 7, but it's all about how to open notepad as administrator, not the actual behavior of the dns lookups afterward.
XP uses the hosts file for name resolution even when DNS client is running.  The contents of the hosts file are automatically loaded into the DNS resolver cache when you save the file.
