I have a linux instance that I set up a while ago to host a ruby website.  I can connect to it via ssh, ping it and browse the website.  I wanted to make a copy of this instance and upgrade the copy, so I created an AMI off of the instance, then launched an instance off of the AMI.
I am at a loss as to why the copies instance isn't working.  Does anyone have any ideas why I can't ping or browse the new instance in a web browser?
I found my problem.  They were actually different security groups.  I got a little confused because it was using the same value for the 'Key Name' field, which I thought was tied to security group and the security group column was mostly off the end of my screen and I didn't notice the difference.  So I just opened up ports in the new security group and everything worked perfectly.  Thanks for the suggestions!  I'm sure they'll come in handy in the future.
I can ssh into the new instance perfectly.  however, I cannot ping it or browse the website.  It is using the same security group as the original instance which has inbound rules for all IMCP and TCP traffic from my IP.  The availability zone changed from us-east-1c to us-east-1a
