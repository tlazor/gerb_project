If you click and hold when you go to drag to change the row/col size, the size in pixels is shown in brackets. These units are not scaled and thus if you set the row and column sizes to equal pixels, they will be square. Of course, this is a manual process.. but you can find the equivalent sizes and then select a range of rows/columns and set all of their sizes at once.
This method utilizes the Excel ruler thus more comprehensible/easier & accurate row & column dimensions.
There is even an option to change the units of measurement within the Display group of the Advanced tab in Excel Options.
First, select the cells you want to resize. Then on the Home tab, go to Cells box and click on Format option. Here you can change the Row Height and Column Width of the selected cells as you want.
If you wanted to do it for the whole sheet, you could use this trick - which may be helpful anyway: click the box to the left of column heading A to select all cells; click on and drag one of the column header dividers to the size you want, noting the number of pixels for the resulting cell width (I'm using Excel 2007, which shows this); do the same for one of the row label dividers, matching it to the column width by pixels.  This should make all cells in the sheet boxes.  Which of course is not what you asked, but I had hoped this trick would work with a subset of cells.  Unfortunately it doesn't.
