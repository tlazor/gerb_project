FIRST OFF: Get _for_free_ Perforce, the code management system. You can get a two person license for nothing...
Run sha1sum over the files. It'll give you a 40 character number (in hexadecimal) that is nearly guaranteed to be unique from ANY other input. When combined with size in bytes, the odds of two files having the same hash value (sha1sum is a hash generating program) but containing different content "approaches zero." You can trust it because, after all, this is it's intended purpose! Sha1sum is how linux people (and other smart groups) verify distribution of media has not been tampered with. A single bit change will change the number dramatically!
First I agree with th3dude19 - check whether or not it's happening in regular Explorer as your first step.
In addition to the other suggestions, I would ask how your boss is copying the files to the external drive.  Is he putting new files there via a manual file copy, or is he running any folder sync tools to keep the external drive up to date?  If he is using any additional tools (such as Sync Toy) to do this, that may be the reason for updated date/time stamps.
If it's still being modified, then if you have Anti-virus it may be re-dating (modified date) the files as it scans them (during the move to the new drive).
P.S. Using sha1sum (or similar,like MD5) is the way to go and is vastly better than going by dates because dates can maliciously be manipulated, but sha1sum will give you the same answer no matter the file system attributes.  RT
This isn't usual, but I've run into it (in that case it was causing an automatic off-site backup to resend files that hadn't changed in any other way).
Directory Opus has options that specifically cover this.  On its menu: Settings > Preferences > File Operations > Copying Files > Preserve the timestamps of copied files.  Check that one and the others in that section.
