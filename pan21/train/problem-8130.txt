I've also switched from Squirrel to RoundCube for my personal domain. From an admin point of view it's six of one and half dozen of the other. From a user point of view RoundCube is a whole lot nicer to use.
Currently have a Debian:Apache,mysql,postfix,php,dovecot running virtual clients. For simplicity I use postfixadmin to add virtual domains and clients and currently using squirrelmail to provide webmail access though I do encourage the use of a desktop mail client (outlook, thunderbird, windows livemail, Any rfc based pop3/Imap/SMTP cient that supports our security settings). Latley our clients have been asking about a more friendly webmail client, so I am trying to have both squirrelmail and roundcube on the same server. So far it has worked nicely save for the lack of documantation on some plugins. A nice interface to enable/disable plugins with plugin description would be nice.
To preface this - I'm a bit of a minimalist but I prefer Squirrelmail despite it being ugly, it scales well has some nice backend options; I've never had any problems with it. I've played around with RoundCube but it tends to be too buggy for me.
