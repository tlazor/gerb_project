First of all I must admit that I struggle with concept of Transaction Log. I mean - I do understand that it is Log of all Transactions that happen on database, but when it comes to properly putting it into context within some task I obviously lack something. So, to anyone who will be answering the question - please feel free to expand on theory behind Transaction Log.
Main question is - I have SQL Server 2008 and 2 GB database that I need mirrored (has 12GB transaction log). If I wasn't mirroring that database I presume I could either switch to Simple mode or truncate the log after backup. But in this case - what should I do if I wish to keep that transaction log under control? As I understand - I need to keep that whole transaction log if I wish to be able to easily mirror database (just do Full backup).
So - can anyone enlighten me on this subject? I understand that I am trying to fill in lots of holes here and that my proposed "solutions" may not be the best ones, but I would sincerely appreciate if somebody can push me in right direction on Transaction Logs, how they impact mirroring and best practices with those two.
Is there any way around this? Ideally I wish it was possible to do backup that keeps both MDF and LDF in 1 file every time and after backup is done Transaction Log (LDF) on database is reduced to 0. The problem with this scenario are incremental backups - if my first backup truncated log, I presume that second backup would need to reference first one if I want to do mirroring later (i.e. I would be stuck with keeping bunch of files instead of just one).
