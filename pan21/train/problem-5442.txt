This is the class performs a diff that is roughly equivalent to a git log --stat and caches them for later use. 
The basic design is to have a visitor walk the commit graph and raise events for a listener to gather information about them. Currently there is a single listener that diffs each commit with its parents and caches those diffs. This should be flexible enough to create another one that, say, collects committer stats though. 
Git's commit history isn't a tree, it's a graph and we don't want to visit any commit more than once, so this class needs to keep track of the commits it's already visited. 
Well, having your abstract class rely on its inheritors like that makes it pretty much useless. This should be declared like this. 
I've recently taken an interest in analyzing commit history to find files with a lot of churn. The idea being that high churn files are likely targets for refactoring. Right now it's a simple console app that returns the number of times a given file was committed. (Renames are not currently followed. It's a known area for improvement.)
