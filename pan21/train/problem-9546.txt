Based on suggestions on this technet thread I uninstalled "RapidBoot Sheild", rebooted the machine and then processes no longer stayed around when killed. Problem solved!
In my case these were Aksdf.sys and Hardlock.sys filter driver from Aladdin Knowledge Systems Aladdin drivers. I have managed to find that answer using RAMMap also. It displayed the memory, consumed by terminated process. The processes were removed from the Windows process list yet persisted in the memory map. The drivers seem to prevent complete termination of the processes.
Open the "Processes" tab in RamMap and sort by name. Look for a suspiciously high number of the same process. On my machine, "SynTPEnh.exe" was the culprit (a part of the touchpad driver). After a week of uptime, it amassed tens of thousands of entries in the page table, each 32kb in size.
After a week without a reboot my "Page Table" was using 4GB+. It turned out that every terminated process stuck around using 20K RAM (4K private, 16K Page Table) as shown in the "Processes" tab of RamMap, and there were ~200,000 of them!
Rebooting reduced the list but it started growing again. It was reproducible by opening notepad, killing it and observing that it is stays in the RamMap processes list.
