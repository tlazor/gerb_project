As an aisde, typically you don't need to (and really shouldn't) name "DOMAIN\Domain Admins" in permissions. The local "Administrators" group will contain "DOMAIN\Domain Admins" if the machine is joined to "DOMAIN", so naming "DOMAIN\Domain Admins" is redundant.
Basically, your administrative privileges are being stripped from your security token when UAC is enabled (just as you're observing). In effect, UAC allows you to logon w/ an  "Administrator"-level account but forces that account to "act" like a limited user. When you attempt to perform an action that requires administrator-level credentials UAC will prompt to elevate. After the elevation completes successfully the action you attempted to perform is done using the non-UAC-filtered security token (which still contains all your administrative group memberships).
You're seeing as-designed behaviour of User Account Control. Have a look at the articles below to learn about more about what's going on "under the hood" when you have UAC enabled.
