My company is looking into the same issue.  Unless I read something better here, we are going with 2 Linksys wireless routers....running DDWRT. 
I've seen it for $100 at Costco. I'm sure that you can order it, or something just like it without much trouble (and it does N with a gigabit ethernet). The Linksys model above is now getting out of date, as it is 802.11g system.
We like to have the public AP auto-disabled during nonbusiness hours as well as blind to our network.  It would be totally open, but may have a welcome portal via wifidog (which, thanks to serverfault, I have discovered runs nicely with DDWRT).
Several companies I know have set up a seperate cheap ADSL connection with a wireless router and this is what is used to provide network access to visitors. 
Netcomm do a product that provides Layer 2 segregation, effectively running each client in it's own VLAN. It even does an SMTP redirect - very handy if your ISP blocks port 25.  Although it's designed as a pay system with tickets, this can just be turned off.
I have a DLink DI-655 and one of recent firmware upgrades came with a new feature, 2 Independent Wifi networks on the AP/Router. The second one is a guest network, with a differnet SSID, the ablity to set different security settings (Primary can be WPA2 w/AES [CCMP] only, and the guest can be WPA w/TKIP for legacy laptops). The guest network can be set to only allow internet access (no internal access). 
The staff router will not broadcast SSID and will use MAC address recognition, be available 24/7 and play nicely with our network.
