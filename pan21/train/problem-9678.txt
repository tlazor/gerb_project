rdiff from librsync is an opensource program that will compute difference (so called deltas) between any (binary or text) files.
rdiff-backup can either be run locally (including towards a network mount) as well as across ssh. Feel free to look at the rdiff-backup example page for a few common usage scenarios.
I would like to continue on the Tometzyk's mention of rdiff and suggest the backup software rdiff-backup. It keeps a mirror copy of the most recent backup, and saves history as compressed reverse diffs. Those times I've used it on database dumps I've remember have goten away with a quite nice (small) delta. That is, you have your mysqldump create a new file with the same filename each dump, and then you run rdiff-backup on that dump.
Here's an alternative approach; since your incremental backup size is small, it's likely that only a few MySQL tables are changing regularly, and you're probably backing up a number of large tables that don't change from day to day.  If you can figure out whether this is the case, you could back up the entire database on a reduced schedule - maybe once a week - and take more frequent backups of the more volatile tables, using:
