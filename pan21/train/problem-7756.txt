After picking up the tables, i will like to populate/join it with the new Database (DATA_ONE) and the tables whiles i append the old database_name to the new tables. Any help on this or is there a better way to do this? Thanks much
One problem you might have with any method is if there are URLs out there in the wild that point to www.someserver.com/yourgame?personid="12345". If you change the IDs you might break those URLs. In this case, you may want to come up with a way of redirecting these old URLs if you need to. This should probably be done by the application though, not by the database.
The most important thing to watch out for is clashes on Primary Key fields. It looks like person.id and games.gameid are two potential problem areas. 
The trick here is that I have 3 db connections. I first connect to the users database and userinfo table, pick up the database_name in a loop, use it to connect each old db and further connect to personal, accounts and games table.
I wrongly designed my application to have one database to each user. each user had 3 similar tables. I now want to have one database and 3 tables only; where i will use the database name in the old databases as a reference in the new system. There was another database called "users" in the old database that stored the database names. I'm done with the schema design of the new database and now left with the migration.
