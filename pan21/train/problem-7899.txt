Example scenario assuming KeepAlive is on: One connection handles the PHP script then that same connection will start downloading an image and the browser opens or uses existing connections to download the other images.
It depends on the keepalive setting. If you set it to 'on' connections are reused. If you set it to 'off' new connections are made for every page element (html/php,image,javascript files, css etc). Keeping it on means a better experience for your users at the expense of server CPU load. Keeping it off means a slower browsing experience but server load is slightly reduced. Also you can tune the keepalivetimeout setting. Set it to 5 or less.
Keep in mind that modern browsers will create at least 2 to 6 persistent connections so it'll be less than 100 clients at a time.
Every connection to the server whether PHP or static file serving are from the same 100 connection pool. Once PHP serves up the HTML the connection is free to be used for something else. If it's a persistent connection then it will probably be re-used to download an image.
