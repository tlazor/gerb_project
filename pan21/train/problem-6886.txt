I know this is an old post, but I was looking long and hard for something almost identical to this. Echoing from a few others posts... it is possible... all be it quite expensive and difficult to establish.  This article is is a bit helpful in the "who does it" and the general "what's involved" ....
Additionally, I've seen posts stating that it will typically take close to a year to satisfy all the requirements and to jump through all the audit hoops. Furthermore, the ancillary costs involved with the entire process can range from $100k to +$1M depending on general contractor+legal+labor costs as well as how many bouts of audit you go through. So, again, not a venture for a small business.
Your question reads to me and to others as "How do I issue certificates to entities inside and outside of my organization that are trusted by arbitrary internet users?"
As for some extras that I've picked up from some scattered sources... some of the requirements are having "substantial equity" and "insurance"... of which I've found to be listed anywhere from $1M to $5M depending on the source. So, needless to say, this is not an option for a small business. 
I also recommend reading "Windows Server 2008 PKI and Certificate Security by Brian Komar"   and consider all of the various PKI scenarios for your applications. You don't need to use Microsoft's CA to get something out of the book.
