Install Windows on SSD and put old hard disk as second (in boot order). It will be D or the next available letter (if D is the DVD-ROM). Then you can browse to Documents and Settings\username\My Documents (for XP) or Users\username (for Vista and 7) to see your old files. If you had a password in old Windows, it could forbid you to access the files since they are locked. Right click on the folder, select Properties and then Security. Click on Advanced and then select the Owner tab. Take ownership of the folder and all subfolders. Click OK to close all windows. If you cannot still access the folder, go to Security again and give Administrators full access to folder, subfolders and files. Now you should be able to see and copy whatever you want.
You could also make an attempt to "repair" old Windows so you can use them in your new computer after installing new drivers! In Windows XP start with appropriate Windows XP CD-ROM (you need SP3 version if you upgraded to SP3, same Windows, same language) and press Enter (install now). Press F8 to agree with Terms and Conditions and then it should detect the old installation and prompt for repair. Press R to start the repair! If it works, you should have full access to all your old applications and files. You will need the serial and to reactivate Windows after repair is complete. If automatic activation fails, try by phone, it should work.
In Windows Vista and 7 you should try "repairing" your computer for "startup errors" using the installation DVD-ROM, but unfortunatelly this doesn't always work as in Windows XP.
