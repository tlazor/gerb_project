Unfortunately, Windows 7 will not bridge a high-speed connection with a 3G connection (or with any other "modem" type connection, for that matter). Please let me know if this helps. I just figured it out the hard way! :(
From what I have tried and learned, the only option for sharing a connection as such is via ICS ("Internet Connection Sharing"). When you enable ICS for the 3G connection (which is treated as a "modem" and not as a "high speed connection") it automatically assigns another LAN connection as the sharer of the 3G connection (when available, and if there are more than 2 available network connections, I believe you have to choose which one shares the 3G).
Anyway, a static IP is assigned to the sharer connection, and the computer will begin to act as a DHCP server for any other devices on that connection. (Make sure to disable or disconnect any other DHCP devices, as such would be when connecting to a router instead of a switch. Or you could just plug into the WAN port of a wireless router.) If using Ad Hoc, make sure to create an Ad Hoc wifi network before sharing the 3G connection, and then when you share, select the Ad Hoc network as your sharer.
