Cincinnati Bell set my new router up like this.  The only way to get it unlocked was to call premium support at $14.95 a month to have them unlock it.  I feel your frustration.  I spent two months battling and even filing complaints with the BBB and State Attorney General office.  Bottom line, no one cares - take the advice of someone above, find out which routers work with your ISP - ditch the rental and set yours up the way you want.
Depending on the ISP, AT&T in america Allows some configurations but not much, Comcast doesn't supply the router, etc.. If you want full control ask what modems works with your ISP and buy that and the router and throw out the rental. You offer the service, not the equipment. That's my motto.
I would contact your ISP.  First off, its not "his" router, it is the ISPs.  It is not "his" decision to do anything, there may be company policy, but if that were the case it would most likely would have been set before it shipped. 
It sounds to me that the tech overstepped his bounds, or was at the very least rude and condescending.  If it were me, I would file a complaint and ask for the official company policy on router access.
