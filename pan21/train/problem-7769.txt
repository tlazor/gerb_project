Honestly, there is plenty of information out there to learn, but in the end, you can't beat real-world experience. If your current job won't provide this, setup various networks at home and put them through the paces... 
Another resource is to play around with network traces. Like look at the trace of loading a simple web page, file sharing, SSL, etc.
I understand the basics of networking such as Lan and stuff. I know what many of the protocols are and how to build a client/server socket program in C. But what I really want is a very good understanding of how networks actually work. Not only from a programming aspect but also from a application aspect. I am looking for some material(preferably a book) which will give me a very good foundation to go off of. I am in the middle of wanting to be a programmer or a UNIX admin, so I really should learn and know how to apply networking fundamentals.
Exploring the material covered in ICND1, ICND2, which is what prepares you for CCNA would be a good learning path to take.
Does any such a concise resource exist? Would it be better going the more academic route by buying a networking book(such as those from Tanenbaum or Kurose), or is it better to go the It route possibly looking into network admin text or certification books.
That said, I wouldn't discount 'book learning' either... I think you need both for 'true' understanding.
