It can also change what data is fast and slow as your use of the system changes, again without you having to change anything.
The long answer is "it depends", specifically on how you use your system, and how much you want to invest in managing the layout of data for performance yourself.
I don't have hardware to try yet, but am battling the boot vs. Smart Response question too.  I'm waist deep in the manual for an ASUS P8Z77 board, and it seem to say that you can partition a large SSD with one partition is a logical drive for Smart Response, and the other is a separate logical drive. The manual's a bit cryptic, though so I'm not sure.
If that's really possible, then presumably you could specify the second partition as the page file location.  This is important to me, as I commonly work with very large database and flat files simultaneously in multiple processes.
In general, though, something like "Smart Responsive" is going to be better: it uses the SSD as a cache for data on the hard disk, and can adapt to store the most frequently used data on the fast system without any user intervention.
That transparency and responsiveness has a significant benefit to you, because odds are you don't want to constantly invest effort in profiling and maintaining that yourself.
If you care about the non-bulletproofed lifetime of MLC chips, ISRT can make you fly fast and keep your data safe.
