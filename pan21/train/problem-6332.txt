If you are regularly remoting into windows machines, you should use RoyalTS. It is fantastic. You can be in a number of machines at a time and switch between them easily.  
Unfortunately I've found no way to fix this. I run with my task-bar on the right-hand edge of the screen and have the opposite problem: when I remote in from some machines it grows to about half remote desktop's set sceeen width (in my case, remote setup is 2x1280x1024 running Vista and the end running the RDC client is XP with 1x1280x1024 and 1x1680x1050 - the problem is present if the RDC client is started full screen on either local monitor or not full-screen no matter what custom size is used).
I only find it a minor irritation though, as resizing the task bar (on each login) is not something that I have to do regularly.
This can happen if you have themes enabled on the target machine (in your office) and in your RDP settings you have themes disabled. This forces Windows to disable themes during the RDP session which includes resizing things like the taskbar.
So far the only way to get the taskbar back I have found is to click the lonely Start button, click Windows Security, choose Start Task Manager, kill the explorer.exe process and start it again in the Task Manager from File > Run.
