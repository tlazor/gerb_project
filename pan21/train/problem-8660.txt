I'm not aware of any manufacturer that builds such an animal but a RAID 0 card and two hard drives accomplish the same thing and more.
Database servers generally have some form of RAID the extra mechanical complexity required is not worth the gain, when you can use cheaper devices for the same effect.
I've been tossing around an idea of how one set of arms could be dedicated to the top surface of the platter, while a second set could be exclusively for the other side. This would essentially make a mini RAID 0 or RAID 1 array within the drive, and would be a decent alternative to a single hard drive with multiple spindles (http://www.google.com/patents/US20060044663) as it would save energy (As only one motor would be required) but would have the same performance benefits of the previously mentioned 'multi-spindle' drive.
Finding room in the enclosure for a second voice coil and set of arms, however, would prove difficult as David mentioned previously. However, a smaller voice coil could solve the issue; the platter could simply be moved to the geometric center of the drive as viewed from the top or bottom and the voice coils could be positioned in opposing corners. A small enough voice coil may already exist, but a smaller coil COULD be too weak to accurately move the arms, which introduces a new problem... I'm sure it could be done, though; look how much smaller computers in general have gotten over the years, after all.
I do remember a CDROM drive that could read data from 7 points at the same time - iirc this was not random, but sequential, allowing the device to read parts of the same file at the same time. It was not so the drive was faster, but quieter (it could spin slower for similar transfer rates).
