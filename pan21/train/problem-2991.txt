The profile of a user contains the personalizations that the user configures in their user interface as well as the HKCU registry hive. If you don't use roaming profiles and have multiple servers users are logging into, a new profile will be created that will not contain any of the previously configured settings from any of the other servers.
You should redirect as much as you can, as this reduces the amount of data that is copied during the logon/logoff process to the roaming profile folder.  All it takes is for a user to copy a 200 MB PowerPoint file to their desktop to blow a hole in your roaming profile strategy.  
I would not redirect Application Data though.  This folder typically incurs a lot of activity during normal operation, and redirecting it can cause performance issues.  
IMO, roaming profiles along with redirected data folders are a good strategy for keeping all user data apart from servers that the users interact with. That way, if you ever lose a server or pull one from the farm for any reason, its pretty much plug a new one in and go forward.
