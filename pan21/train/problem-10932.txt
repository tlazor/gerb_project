Thus, why is the document on the website not automatically opening in a new tab?  I know I may right-click and select Open in new tab or click the middle mouse button/scroll wheel,  but I would like to know why the tabbed browsing setting is not working.  For the record, I am using Internet Explorer 9.
While visiting a website, I notice this behavior on my PC.  I have set up a simple example to illustrate.  
I want the document on Link 1 to open in a new tab as it does for Link 2.  I have done some homework and I know this involves the Tabbed Browsing Settings in IE on my machine.  As you can see below, I have it set to Always open pop-ups in a new tab.
Let's say I have a webpage which has two links.  The first is a link to a document on a website.  The other is  a link to a document on a file share.  When I click the first link, the document on the website is opened in a new Internet Explorer window.  When I click the second link, the document on the file share is opened in a new tab.  Both have a target attribute set to blank.
