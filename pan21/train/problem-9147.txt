However, if someone steals your laptop and opens it up after not getting past POST, then you have defeated the object. 
It won't catch fire, but it's still a bad idea.   Any time you attach the physical copy of a password to the object it protects, you effectively render the password meaningless.   Not only that, but you're protecting the wrong thing. 
Storing credentials for something directly inside or outside of that something is never a good idea. Even if you give only a hint on that note and not the real thing, that gives an attacker a valid vector for his attack.
If someone steals your notebook, you hope and pray all they are doing is reinstalling an OS and deleting all of your work.  That also gets rid of all of your personal information, and your work should be backed up using a cloud service (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) or onto optical disks that have a long shelf life (BD-ROM) or other media.  Its your operating system and account passwords you should be worried about, because if someone steals your notebook, you're not going to get it back, no matter how much the person who sold you a protection plan said otherwise.  It will either never be found, or will be kept in an evidence locker.  Insurance just replaces the lost machine.
There is nothing inside a laptop that should get hot enough to ignite paper, if it does, you have far greater issues. 
The smarter solution to your problem would be to use a password safe and store the necessary credentials there. Another great plus for the use of such a tool is that you can generate strong passwords because you do not have to remember them.
