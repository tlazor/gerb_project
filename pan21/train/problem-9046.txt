The out of the box Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance within XP and 7 are more than adequate to control and share all the facility from the connecting machine to the recipeint machine.  
DameWare allows you to connect to the interactive session kind of like VNC, but extra features including the ability to remotely install the client on a remote machine.
Basically, what you need is to replace termsrv.dll with an older version (2055, from WinXP SP1) and apply a few changes to the registry and settings.
The complete step-by-step instruction (including the registry hacking and dll replacing) is available here - http://www.freetutorialssubmit.com/concurrent-remote-desktop-without-log-off-other-users/801
AT the company I work for we use DameWare Mini Remote Control. Not a free product, but they do have a fully functional trial version.
Is it possible to use Windows remote desktop connection to connect to a Windows XP machine with a user already logged in and just view that users screen without logging them off?
The features as well as the overhead used by a computer to keep most of the third party remote desktop/assistance sessions waste facility, waste bandwidth when they constantly collect information about who is connected even when not being used.  They are also a point of security issue when they constantly run.
