Files with the .pyc extension are the compiled version of .py (Python) files that get automatically generated when the .py file is run.
By default, when you set up a site, Plesk will install some test files for CGI, FCGI (Fast CGI), ColdFusion (CFML) and PHP. These are so you can check all the correct software is working when you set up a site, not very useful I know but they're there all the same.
and save it with a .py extension somewhere, then from the command line run python ./path/to/that/file.py and it will echo out 'Hello World', then if you check the directory with the .py file in there should be a .pyc file next to it that was created when the Python script was compiled and run.
.py is python code which is usually readable and pyc is the compiled python code which would not be readable and is probably created on demand which might explain why it has a different timestamp. Are you sure this isn't just some test website that happens to be configured to use python? 
I believe it's a file associated with Fast CGI which is likely turned on in Plesk. It's a complied version of the Python script.
As for how the script got there, my guess would be someone like GoogleBot came along and hit that file on the website, this caused the file to get run with Python which created that .pyc file. The next time someone hits that URL, instead of having to re-compile the Python script again it can just use the .pyc file so it'll be faster.
You can just delete those files if you don't need/want them, anything in the /test directory in httpdocs is just test scripts.
