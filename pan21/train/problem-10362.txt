Obviously the screen works just fine, and I want to use it as a secondary monitor for my working computer. However, I tried connecting both laptops with an HDMI cable but when I press ['Win-key' + P] until I reach the 'extend screen' option, nothing happens on the secondary laptop. 
I am no computer expert by any means but I'm guessing that I cannot utilize the broken laptop as a secondary monitor either because:
Any ideas on how I can use this perfectly good screen as a secondary monitor WITHOUT having to wipe anything (I still want to try salvaging the broken HDD when I have enough free time to kill).
There is only one laptop on the market with this function and it is an alienware. hdmi ports on laptops are output otherwise as already stated. you could use a linux boot thumb drive, a video capture card over usb and applicable software to get the same effect but at that point your better off with another monitor.
you could gerry rig the monitor on the laptop using an adapter but that would require disassembly of the monitor housing and installation of the adapter
My lenovo P400 ideapad, running win 8.1, crapped out a few months ago (registry error and I can't access my HDD) and I recently got a new laptop running win 10. Last time I tried fixing the computer, it got stuck in a disk-checking loop so I set my broken laptop to boot from its UBS port first. This way, the files on the USB break the loop and allow me access to the command-line and all the fancy win 8.1 blue repair/refresh screens that do nothing.
