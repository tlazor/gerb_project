The amazon s3 server where your data is stored does not have or present a valid certificate for s3.mydomain.com, so all visitors will see the certificate warning.
This is completely normal and is exactly how SSL certificates are supposed to work - otherwise any site could pretend to be any other SSL encrypted site. Certificates are used for authentication as well as just encryption, with the identity verification being done by the Certificate Authority (CA) when the certificate is purchased.  If you're not who you say you are when you purchase the certificate, the CA should refuse to create it or issue it to you - if they don't do that verification step, they'll find themselves removed from the default trusted CA list distributed with web browsers like Firefox, Chromium, IE, Edge, etc.
The application code on your server should then fetch the required data from amazon and return it to the user, who never needs to know or care that amazon was involved.
The CNAME in your DNS zone is working as you expect, but browsers check that the certificate presented by the remote web site is valid for the domain being visited.
The "normal" way to do what you want to run your own https server for your domain WITH a certificate signed by a certificate authority that is known and trusted by the browser.  For private/intranet type web applications, you can run your own CA and distribute the CA's certificate to your users.  For public web-sites, it's best/easiest to just buy a certificate from one of the well-known CAs.
