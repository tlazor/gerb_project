For the record, I have NOT overclocked my graphics card or CPU. I've made sure that all the drivers (including the BIOS firmware) is up to date. There's also no power supply voltage switch to change (that I can see). 
I'm hoping it's not the motherboard because the warranty from the store is out and I can't wait 4-6 weeks for a new one from the manufacturer. Any ideas on what I can do to dig down and find the root of this problem?
I was looking at getting a power supply tester but I'm wondering if it's worth spending $20 on or if I should just buy a new power supply? I'm thinking it's the power supply because it's 6+ years old now but it worked fine with the old motherboard and it's 500W (they advertise it as being 550W but that's only under heavy loads) which should be what I need for my setup. If it might be my CPU overheating, what is a good way to find that out? My old motherboard would beep if it overheated but I guess this motherboard doesn't do that.
I've contacted the motherboard manufacturer (MSI) and they said to try reinstalling Windows, reset BIOS, test the power supply on another PC, or replace the power supply. I reinstalled Windows, reset the BIOS to the default settings and I also moved the plug (for the power supply) to another surge protector but that didn't fix it. I also thought it might be the CPU overheating so I replaced the heatsink but that didn't fix it either. 
I upgraded my computer a month or two ago now and now every so often, my computer will randomly shutdown (and then restart after about 5 seconds). To clarify, it usually shuts down when coming out of sleep mode, it did it while I was downloading an update and also when booting into Windows. I upgraded the motherboard and CPU but I didn't replace the power supply or RAM. I read online to check the fuses on the motherboard to see if there's any corrosion and I don't see any.
