It's a great step up from Windows XP, and features an environment which receives more updates, more support, as opposed to XP, which will stop receiving support later down the line, not to mention something I read recently about an older bug in it which wasn't going to get fixed.
Many people only look at the software they are running and say oh look, in 64 Bit software xy runs 1% slower in 32 Bit emulation, than in real 32 Bit Mode. But in my opinion the boost that your OS gets out of the 64 Bit is much more than 1% compared to a specific Software.
Windows 7 64-bit will munch more memory than 32-bit, but it's rock-solid from the past 2 months of personal use. I've also placed it on my media center (the 32-bit Win7 edition) and it is quite fast considering only 1GB of RAM is available, and a low-end AMD X2 is powering that machine.
In the first 64 Bit era, many drivers of actual Hardware has no drivers supporting 64 Bit, but these days are long gone.
Another thing to keep in mind, I read that Software which not supports 64Bit will not get the Windows 7 Ready thing.
XP 64, Vista and currently the RC of Windows 7 and I never have had any Problems nor Speed Issues with 32 Bit applications.
