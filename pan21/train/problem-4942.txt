Provided you do not have a proper cable detector, or other equipment, and you do not intend to fiddle with some discovery protocols you might want to switch all the network stations, approach each station, detach the LAN cable, and attach it to a laptop or something, and see which light comes on on the switch. Two people are ideal for this. This is the fool-proof way to do this. (Also get yourself a decent label printer).
I have rcently joined a company and we want to migrate our network to 10.0.0.0 ip address range from 192.168.0.0.
If your switch infrastructure is managed and intelligent enough, you should be able to see the MAC addresses present on each port.  In Cisco-land, the command is show mac-address-table on the switch.
Some hosts and switches may be capable of using CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) and/or LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to determine their place in the network infrastructure.  The availability and usefulness of this will vary widely, and is too broad to exhaustively categorize here.
But the major challange i am facing is that there is no documentation available for wiring. How can i track which port of which switch is going to which system.
