My quicklaunch menu contains maybe 15 entries. Still quite fast to pop up, but I nearly stopped to use them when I installed launchy.
In the beginning it might pick the wrong entry until you enter the o/a. After several launches, it learns which one you're more likely to mean directly. If you use notepad more often, it will pop it as first choice.
You can also customize keyboard shortcuts for opening the launchy prompt window. And you do not need to take your hands from the keyboard to reach your mouse.
It also learns which entry you use most. Say that you have a program called notepod and one called notepad.
The only problem is that you need to know the name of the programs you use. Not really a problem, actually.
You might consider reviewing the Processor Scheduling in the Performance Options.  Right-click "My Computer" > Advanced > Performance "Settings" > Advanced.
I have several folders worth of shortcuts to my applications in my Quick Launch in XP.  At any given point during the day, it could take up to 20 seconds for the icons to appear.  I'm assuming it's recursing through the shortcuts to get the .ico for the .exe's but why does it not cache it, or if it is, can you change the cache length?
It scans automatically the entries of your Start->Program menu and lets you enter as many letters needed for unique entry, then launch.
