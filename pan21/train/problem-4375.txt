It is also always worth checking that the public key you put on your server didn't end up there in multiple lines. One public key = one single line in the authorized_keys file.
On your server, check the system logs in /var/log. I am not sure where failed login attempts get logged on your machine, but look for the log files that have been changed recently after a failed login and you should be able to come up with something.
I was speaking to the hosts and it would seem that the key I generate needs to be made in Putty on a windows machine, the converted to work on my Ubuntu machine.  This doesn't seem right like but I am going to give it a go and see what happens!
My solution was to just give up and move authorized keys to /etc/ssh/users/[user name]/authorized_keys and then changed /etc/ssh/sshd_config's AuthorizedKeysFile setting:
One thing to check is permissions on the key file on the server. I have found in the past that sshd will not use the authorised_keys file unless the permissions are greatly restricted.
This should give you debug info on both sides. The sshd process will probably be more interesting because it will tell you why it's rejecting the key.
If that didn't help, try getting a verbose out put from ssh: ssh -v -l username hostname. The output is hard to read and understand, but it might give you a clue about what might have gone wrong.
