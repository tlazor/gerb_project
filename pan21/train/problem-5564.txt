Some things don't lend well to step-by-step instructions, so I try to provide as much configuration data as I can. Some technically-inclined person who ends up maintaining down the road will have a better idea of what they are up against, and hopefully it will make their life a little easier when something goes wrong.
For certain things, I've written step-by-step instructions. You can call this a checklist if you want, but it's not really intended to be physically checked off. I call my documentation style the "kindergarten steps". It's patterned after an MCSE exercise book I had for one of the Windows 2000 exams. The steps are very detailed, but the use of bold/italics/typeface makes it easy to gloss over and just pick out the important parts so you don't need to read everything after you've learned the steps.
I'm pretty big on documentation. The company where I work now feels that documentation is important, but some people in the company feel they don't have time to write documentation. This can make life difficult for anybody besides the person that originally did it.
