Would a centralized radius based AAA service consisting of multiple radius nodes be better than a distributed radius AAA service.i.e. one radius per NAS and why? We want to utilize accounting data during authorization so a distributed radius service will require synchronization of accounting data as well as user authentication data in almost real time. But with 10s of different locations, synchronization of data in real time seems to be difficult to achieve. I read about radius proxy servers that forward radius queries to a central radius server, however, I fail to understand how would it be more beneficial over directly using a centralized radius service directly from NAS. i.e. all NASs point to same radius service. 
Our network setup consists of 5 network access servers in 5 different locations worldwide and it is expected to expand in the coming days to 15 network access servers and more in future. Currently we use scripts for authentication but we are planning to use freeradius based AAA for authentication and accounting with these NAS servers due to many benefits that we can gain from utilizing accounting data. The user load is expected to grow to hundreds of thousands of users in coming days.  My question to experts having practical experience of this kind of architecture is from scalability point of view. What is the best freeradius topology to be used in such a setup? 
If a distributed radius service is considered, radrelays may be a way to go, but rad relays seem to be useful for primary to standby kind of setup where number of radius nodes is mostly two  and I am not sure if they will be good to use if the they have to synchronize data between so many different radius servers.
