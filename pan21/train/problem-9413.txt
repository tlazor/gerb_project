I encountered the same problem (also on the XPS13 interestingly). It seems to have to do with how the audio is actually played, see for example this thread that you can find by googling "windowscentral.com 253168-audio-shuts-off-when-screen-goes-sleep" (I have too little rep in this community to include more than 2 links, and this is the least relevant). One solution that was suggested was to use a screensaver that's a black screen, and set your screen to never turn off.
When my Win 7 PC goes to sleep (or put to sleep by me), I can power off the monitor (with built-in speakers). I just need to make sure that I turn on the monitor BEFORE I wake up my PC. If so, I have sound. Remote desktop wake-up will ruin this because I am not there to turn on the powered-off monitor. 
The ultimately desired solution, of course, would be for Spotify to support this connected standby mode. But the problem has apparently been around for quite a while already, so that may not happen any time soon.
I have found that on my new XPS 13 9360 with the creators update, if I am playing back music from any source (Spotify for example), when the screen turns off after a couple of minutes, audio seems to get muted.
If you set it as "Duplicate screens", when you turn off both of them then sound (Spotify or another sound program) it continues on playing.
Just keep in mind that anytime when the PC is NOT in the sleep mode, the monitor must be on. Otherwise, Win 7 will turn off sound because it senses no speakers. On my PC, the only way to get sound back is to restart. The "net stop audiosrv, ..." trick does not work.
