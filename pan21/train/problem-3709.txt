However, this backup process is a 3 stage process (mount, rsync, unmount), I want to automate it so that it's all 1 script that I have to execute.
I have two computers in my possesion, one local, one remote. The remote machine I have full access too (root), but it is not really in a physically secure location (i.e. someone can break into the office and steal the drives).
The problem is that I don't know how to provide my password (that I type in when the script executes in my local machine) from my local machine to the remote server so that it can mount the encrypted partition. 
Is there any way I can provide my password to the remote server, either by typing it in while the script executes or while reading from a file on my local disk somewhere? 
I use the remote machine for storing encrypted backups... first I mount the encrypted partition, then I run my backup (rsync), then I unmount the partition; in this way I can be assured that if the remote machine is stolen then my stuff is still secure.
Edit: I should add that the mounting and unmounting steps are currently run on the remote server, but the rsync process runs on my local machine. I basically rsync a directory from local to remote.
