You will probably need to restart you web host service as well at the same time (assuming you're using httpd/apache):
personally I have a shell script in my root folder which I can run to add my iptables rules, I just update it as and when I need new rules adding then run the script, I also have one to open all the ports up to see if there is a firewall issue causing me problems (this is my personal server with nothing business critical on it, I don't recommend you open up all your ports for any length of time if there is anything worth stealing on there).
One very important thing to consider on CentOS is Security Enhanced (SE) Linux, it's a powerful tool when used correctly, but can tend to cripple you when setting up a system for the first time, if disabling your firewall doesn't fix the issue I would try disabling selinux as well to test (if this solves your issue then you can either leave SE Linux disabled, which would be less secure, or you can look in to building your own SE linux policy with audit2allow)
Any similar rules you want to set up you can add in this file, I tend to comment everything to ensure I don't have a brain fart when I return to it later.
But if you are able to test, I would recommend you save this locally on the machine (root folder is a good place IMO as root should be the only one who can see the files and then set it's permissions to 700 (chmod 700 filename.sh - I call mine firewall.sh and firewallopen.sh)):
Then create a similar file to lock your server down (I drop all the rules at the start of the script to ensure no unexpected results - note I accept all outgoing connections from my server):
Once you have both scripts, you can easily and quickly turn your firewall on and off and then test whether the problem continues after you have disabled the firewall. You can then easily turn it back on again afterwards.
