You could use a couple of these as a mounted filesystems to cache data using your app's logic (it is battery backed so should survive boot and other outages) or you could use them as swap space and let the kernel use decide how to use them (though as OS kernels are usually optimised assuming all swap locations are more orders of magnitude slower and more latent than real RAM then this will be, you'll probably have to tweak it significantly to get best use of such an arrangement).
The FusionIO option is going to be better value for money if you really need something that big, this sort of RAM drive may be better as a compromise. Working out how well a server capable of 128Gb RAM on the motherboard and a couple of these with the full 64Gb populated compares price- and performance-wise to a specialist server that supports 256Gb or more directly, I leave as an exercise for the reader!
In a similar vein to the FusionIO suggestion, you can get devices that let you hook dynamic RAM to a SATA interface. Something like this (I have no experience of the product or company, it is just the first option that came out of a "Google Shopping" search).
