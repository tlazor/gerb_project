What I'm noticing is that if I have one browser window open on a page that is processing and loading, I can't do anything else in another browser window on the same PC until the first one completes. So in Window 1, processing may take 30 seconds. Window 2 may be a simple click on a table in PhpMyAdmin, or I may be trying to browse back to the main page which usually loads quickly. But both of those things just sit and spin until Window 1 completes what ever it's doing, then bam - Window 2 is loaded. This is not true if Window 2 is on another PC. But that second PC also has the same limitation of only on Window working at a time.
This clearly seems like there's a setting somewhere where either Apache or MySQL or PHP or something can only handle one thread per connection at a time. But I'm not sure where to look as I'm not all that familiar with configuration settings on either of them. Can anyone tell me where I should be looking?
I have a LAMP web application that has some pages that do quite a bit of processing and take a while to complete. Sometimes as the developer I like to do two things at once as I'm working on a feature. So I may have more than one browser window open at a time. One of them may be PhpMyAdmin, or I might be evaluating two pages that use the same feature to make sure things match, or whatever.
