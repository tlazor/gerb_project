Linux understands and uses the concept of caching. After a file been accessed for first time, the contents are kept in memory(if free) for future use. Next time you run the same command, the CPU just fetch the content from the memory, without going or reading anything. So it increases the overall speed of execution. 
Let's say you opened terminal and then type the command pwd. For the first time it will require some time to display the current working directory. Now run the pwd again, this time you'll see that the execution is very fast. Because while running the second time, the current working directory was already saved in the memory. CPU just fetched the information. 
This is because of the cache. The concept of cache is very simple. It is a way faster memory than the normal disks. Whenever you want to find something or run a command the cpu first contact cache, if it is in cache then, the fetching happens very fast. But if not then it goes to normal memory and find then fetches and the whole process takes some time.
