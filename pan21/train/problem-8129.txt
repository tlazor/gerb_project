I haven't found a solution to that problem and I can't seem to find any other references that could possibly fix this issue. I believe Microsoft may have changed something in the executable that requires it to have some level of trust for it to work.
Well, everything except Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC). When started it produces an error: Your account or computer is not joined to any domain. Join to a domain and try again. All other AD-related management tools work just fine.
Yes. Most of the built-in tools to manage things relating to your domain require that they are being run as a domain user.  That necessitates the machine they are running from be joined to that domain.
I've been using the following to manage untrusted domains. It worked without any problems until I attempted to run the Administrative Center on a Windows 10 workstation. Windows 7 and 8, no issues.
Is it impossible to run ADAC outside an AD domain or am I still missing some configuration? I do not want to join the host machine to the lab domain.
That said, there are 3rd party tools that can be used to manage a domain.  For example, any LDAP browser can manipulate objects in the directory.  You just don't get a lot of the GUI niceties like check boxes and radio buttons for certain properties.
I'm setting up a Active Directory lab environment on a Windows 8.1 laptop. I now have a Windows Server Core 2012 domain controller running inside a VM. I installed Server Manager for Windows 8.1 and have set things up so I can manage everything from the Win8.1 host machine.
