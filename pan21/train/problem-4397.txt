On the routers: leave the four dd-wrt devices as-is, just set the wifi configuration up on it, give each one an IP address, disable the DHCP server and only use the LAN ports (not the WAN port) to connect the devices together. Quick and dirty but does the trick just as well. Or you can tick the "use WAN port as LAN switch" on the config to give yourself an extra port (and prevent any configuration errors regarding the above). This way you can plug the devices in to whichever port you wish, in whichever configuration you desire. Chain as many as you like together using whatever ports are available.
On cabling: would getting someone in to do your actual cabling be out of the question? Many a thing can go wrong when using horrendously long cables such as what you may be proposing in a building with unshielded electrics and in either underground/overhead locations, so you may be better getting a quotation and a warranty to help in those instances of chasing up and down ladders, re-terminating and re-crimping...
