Been having a bit of trouble getting my Ubuntu server to relay my mail to external addresses. Here's whats currently happening:
For delivery to this same server, you don't need relaying. Relaying is when connecting clients use your server to send mail to other servers.
So, my question is - why is this happening? How can I fix it? I'd ideally like to make it so any mail client anywhere can connect to a mailbox on my server (clients, etc.)
When I telnet locally to port 25 I can send email to any host just fine. However, when I try to connect from my Mac here to the server, I get a Relay Access Denied error after I enter the rcpt to: section of the message body.
Your Mac is on a separate network.  Change mynetworks to allow the networks you want to allow.  It might look like this for you:
The mynetworks directive in main.cf specifies which networks the postfix server will relay for.  Your current setting only allows the local host (the postfix server) to relay mail through itself.
Look at virtual_mailbox_domains, virtual_mailbox_base, virtual_alias_maps and virtual_mailbox_maps. You can configure what domains it will accept mail for, and what users you have.
I've searched the site and tried various suggestions but none seem to be working for me! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
