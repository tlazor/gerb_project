Would it be particularly dangerous for me to open port 22 for SSH connections with my setup as I've described? I know it would be more dangerous, but I'm not exactly the NSA in that there's not a horde of people just itching to get inside my network, so I'm just curious about if the extra risk would be substantial.
Anyway I was thinking I might just open port 22 to my server so I don't have to connect with a VPN client first. I have password logins disabled and connect using an ssh key instead.
I have a CentOS home server that I use for various things, which sits on my home network behind my router. Normally when I want to do something remotely I will VPN in (my router has a built-in OpenVPN server function that I use) and work from there.
For a home setup, I would prefer SSH to a machine in the network that I can branch tunnels out from. As far as security goes, I also put more faith in SSH on a CentOS box than OpenVPN on a retail router. Also you wouldn't have to worry about your home network ever being in the same subnet as where you are connecting from, a common VPN issue.
If you have anything to secure (which seems logical, considering you have a key based SSH setup and VPN configured), secure it to the best of your ability. Changing the port cuts down on automated attacks, so why even take the chance when it is so easy to change and so easy to specify when connecting? I would pick one or the other (to reduce the vectors of attack), and use every possible means to secure the connection you decide to stay with. Both offer similar functionality, so which one is easier to use?
Some people prefer to run SSH on a non-standard port. This is not so much a security measure as it is a way to reduce noise in your auth logs, as the vast majority of ssh brute-force scripts only try to connect to the default port.
