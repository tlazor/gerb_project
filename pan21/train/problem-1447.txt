I created a task in Task Scheduler, and it allowed me to create the task, which was to run a program. . I set it to run 'At startup' delayed 1 minute. I set it to 'Run with highest privileges' Configured for Windows 10. I set it to allow running on demand. When I rebooted my computer the program didn't start.
c:\windows\system32\task, but in task scheduler i could not see my task. Task job was always successfully executed, but i could not managed because i could not see it. What i did to solve problem was: First in view tab i deselected show hidden task (if it is selected), then with up arrow that appears on the top of task sections, like task history etc, i closed all panes. Then i saw my task listed, i just right clicked with mouse, and whoala normal view appeared. 
I thought maybe it hadn't been created so I tried to create it again. When I got to the end of creating it I got the error message:
"An error has occurred for task Launch 'Program Name'. Error message: A task or folder with this name already exists"
"An error has occurred for task Launch 'Program Name'. Error message: A task or folder with this name already exists"
So it says it exists, but as mentioned it doesn't run at startup, and doesn't show on the list. I can still run the program on demand no problem.
Have you tried opening the Task Scheduler with administrator privileges? That did the trick for me. See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/42717238/7909205.
When I went back to Task Scheduler and looked in the Task Scheduler Library the entry wasn't there. I refreshed the list and it still didn't show. I moved back up to the main Task Scheduler directory and the summary of current tasks (79 items). The task didn't show up there either. I refreshed both lists and it still didn't show.
