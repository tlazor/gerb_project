For fixing this in iTerm2, left alt key is set to Esc+ by default, change this to Normal. Presumably there will be something similar for other terms.
Assuming a UK keyboard layout, it can be a pain to input # (the hash symbol), due to various factors (meta key, Hash on Alt+3, etc).
Assuming a US keyboard, Press i to go into insert mode, and then shift-3.  You can use either shift key, and press it the same time as the '3' key.  The three key is after two, and before four.
There is the very remote possibility that the user is using an antique unix that has # mapped to delete and @ mapped to kill (^U on most traditional modern systems).
This is unlikely to be the case -- it's not likely that anyone is running irix 5.4 or hp/ux 10.20 these days, but who knows, right?
If his system is configured this way, he will not be able to type a # because every time he does it will delete whatever character is to the left of where he is trying to type the #.  The simplest way to fix this is stty erase (ctrl-V)(backspace key).
