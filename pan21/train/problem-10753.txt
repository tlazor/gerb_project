Dealing with data safety depends greatly on the importence of the data, it's sensitivity, and the expense of any loss or downtime. Sometimes your clients will express this directly, otherwise you need to define the needs yourself. For instance one of our services carries a guarantee in a disaster situation of no more than three hours downtime and 24 hours data loss, while another more interactive service has similar guarantees set at 15 minutes and 30 minutes - serving that latter guarantee is obviously much more involved (and some are even more fine, some banking services have huge fines for even minutes of downtime or loss).
For some protection against drive failure look into RAID, but never consider that a backup or DR solution. For that you need a proper backup regime. Local onsite (but off-machine) backups for immediate restore, offsite backups for worse situations, and offline for security too. How often you take backups to where and how (full, diff, log...) depends a lot on data size, change rate, and the site mentioned recovery windows. Also replication can provide similar protection to RAID, sometimes better as you can potentially survive machine failure with little or no downtime but remember there are a huge family of issues that neither RAID nor replication can protect you from.
That is quite a broad question (and is likely to be closed as such so you might want to describe you situation in more detail), so I'll go for a broad answer in the hope it'll give you some keywords to help research further.
You seem to be more concerned about data safety than security, but I'll touch on the latter anyway: basically make sure access to the DB is as limited as possible, firewall to prevent outside access, VPN of you need external access yourself, for multiple applications give each is own login and manage read and write access as granularly as you can cope with, and so forth.
