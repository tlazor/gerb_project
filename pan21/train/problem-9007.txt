This is harder than it seems, because I cannot see any reference to the Swedish layout anywhere in the settings panel. Below are the places I've checked.
My work laptop for some reason came with the US English and Swedish keyboard input methods by default (I later added Czech since I needed it) Something causes it to keep switching to the Swedish layout, and I've no idea what that is. I want to remove Swedish altogether, I only need the US and Czech layouts. 
I cannot find any mention this Swedish input method anywhere in Control Panel or Settings. Does anyone have any idea at all where this can be removed?
Left-click the language switcher in task tray, select "Language preferences", then in the next window click "Region & language", then "Advanced keyboard settings" then "Language bar options". This will bring up an older-style Windows settings dialog called "Text Services and Input Languages" with two tabs - switch to the "Advanced Key Settings" tab. There will be a table that allows you to enter a key sequence to perform different actions. Hit "Change key sequence" on all of them and select "Not assigned".
OK I found a workaround to mitigate this somewhat, but I never figured out how to excise the Swedish input method. What I've done is prevent the "random" switching between the input methods - which was being triggered by a keyboard combination that happened to occur when I was coding (it was Ctrl + Shift, or something like that).
