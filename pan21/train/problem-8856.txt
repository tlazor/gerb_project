I think it would be faster to run a minimal Linux distro like Arch in VirtualBox and use that for running the servers and things like the console commands that generate your skeletons. I use git for all my source control and just push and pull from a remote repo to share code between my VMs, it's just easier that way than setting up something special.
Good luck. I think this approach is much more reliable and straightforward than cygwin or other POSIX implementations on Windows; it generally takes significant fiddling to get those things to work correctly for more than a couple of applications, and I assume if you're going to be running a server you'll have some issues with it.
I've found virtualizing Windows XP pretty sluggish with a full dev environment running, but maybe that's just because I do that for Flex development which requires Flex Builder which almost instantly consumes all of my VM's allocated RAM. Virtualization is really demanding on your hardware, my next build is going to have 16GB of RAM so that I can virtualize in peace.
