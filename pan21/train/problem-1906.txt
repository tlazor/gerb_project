You should only need to send the full backup to your Far Secondary once, then ship the logs and they should stay as synced as time lag allows.  The start up time is only painful when you start or restart log shipping, hopefully this is once per year or less. 
If, however, you don't have to send the same full backup each time, then a one time full with logs between may be possible depending on the rate of change in the database. Obviously this all depends on what the requirements say.
I didn't stopped the Existing Log Shipping nor the Daily full backup job just made sure the log files didn't get deleted so i increased the LS_Backup log file retention to 3 days and done the Standard procedure.
These two are competing items. If it takes 12 hours to transfer and you must transfer full backups every time then I don't see how that will fit in a 6 hour window, let alone be able to do anything of use with it.
I tried doing the backup restore as soon as it got copied (after 19 hours) then i proceeded  with the standard procedure of configuring the Log Shipping on primary and i had ran the LS_Copy job which took a while to copy some 300 log files and then LS_Restore job took it with grace and brought the DR in sync.
Potentially, depending upon the requirements (which we currently don't have or know), although this could lead to other undesirable consequences if the latency is very high. Availability groups do not like latency.
