Suppose we construct a non-unitary quantum system α in hilbert space. It entails that this system would have no direct parallel in quantum circuitry as it is a requirement that all quantum gates are unitary and therefore the function constructed from them is also unitary. But does this mean that we cannot practically implement α?
Is there a clearly defined subset of non-unitary quantum systems where α is practically implementable? Is it, perhaps, universal?
A potential parallel is found in the simulation of classical computations on a quantum computer, achieved by simulating an information-destroying NAND gate using an information-preserving Toffoli gate. If a non-unitary quantum system was such because it implemented a 'quantum NAND gate', it would be possible to redesign it as a unitary system using a Toffoli gate. It is not clear to me (and I cannot immediately find literature on this) if there are clearly defined bounds on what non-unitary operations can be simulated using unitary equivalents.
