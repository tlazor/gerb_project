You're doing it correctly -- this process works on my setup.  The /cygdrive/X notation should work for any drive that Windows has mounted and given a drive letter.
Note: You must open the properties dialog of the binary itself (ie mintty.exe)  and not the short cut to access the administration option for the application.
I'm using the latest version of Cygwin to try to cd into a network drive on Windows XP Pro Service Pack 3. The path in Windows Explorer to this directory is something like:
It just froze there and hung. Any ideas how I can go into this directory and at least taking a listing of the files in there?
I tried mounting it to a drive letter ('X') in Explorer, which worked just fine, but then when I ran the command:
Stumbled here with the same problem. I know this is an old post but hope it will help others just in case. I had no luck with the suggested solutions. However this worked for me: cd //remotehost/d$ if the the remote host is a Windows machine.  The dollar sign does the trick.
I had the same symptoms.  The problem appeared to be related to running the application in administration mode.  As soon as I turned off the option to 'Run this program as an administrator' and restarted the application I was able to access the network drives via the /cygdrive/ directory.
If those work but Cygwin still can't view /cygdrive/X (or /cygdrive/z after your Windows pushd test), I'd try rebooting your workstation.  If the problem persists after a reboot, you may have a broken Cygwin installation; I honestly can't think of any other reasons why it wouldn't work.
