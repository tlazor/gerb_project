We are using the java device manager for Nortel devices and have yet to successfully implement QOS. We have found various settings but not a way to apply it to an actual port or type of traffic. 
show running-config verbose module qos will dump the (almost) entire system configuration for QoS. Take note of the qos if-assign port ... name allQoSPolicyIfcs line as that's how a policy is attached to a port. Defining the other 1000's of things I'll leave to you.
"Assign a priority to DXL VoIP traffic with a DSCP priority level which will be co-exist with the rest of the real-time traffic on your system. For most cases a priority level of “Expedited” (ef) can be used for VoIP traffic."
Generally speaking, one-way-voice problems are rarely the fault of QoS. This is almost always a routing (nat, or security) issue where the stream of traffic in one direction is blocked. Inspecting traffic flow should indicate where the breakdown is occurring.
Background information: We have intercoms on a Nortel network that are only working one-way, when they need to be both. On our cisco network the intercoms work both ways without issue (no QOS is configured on Cisco). Our support rep for the intercoms (Harding) suggests that we require QOS on the network. Since my coworkers and myself have hit a wall, we have come here for help. 
I am familiar with Cisco QOS but not Nortel. I have failed to find appropriate documentation and I can't call support (Nortel doesn't exist anymore). This would be taking place on a security network.
