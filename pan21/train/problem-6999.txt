Today, however, Windows 7 says the flash drive is empty and that its capacity is only ~200 MB.  Since I only ever use the flash drive to transfer data between computers, and not to archive data, losing the data is no problem.  But I do want its full capacity!
Kingston Digital 32GB USB 3.0 DataTraveler (DTR30G2/32GB).  I purchased it 2 years ago and have been using it in the FAT32 file system.  For 2 years it has had 32 GB capacity.
Does all of this indicate that the flash drive is "dead"?  Is there anything else I can try in order to save it?
Finally, I connected the flash drive to a different laptop -- a MacBook Pro (since FAT32 is compatible with Windows and Mac) -- but OS X too says it is 200 MB, even after I reformat it on that machine.
As a test, I tried to copy ~400 MB of files to the flash drive (in case Windows was only displaying the incorrect capacity), but Windows will not let me:
So, I reformatted it using Windows 7.  But even after reformatting, Windows still shows its capacity as 200 MB.  I reformatted both with and without the Quick Format option, but the outcome is the same -- its capacity is only 200 MB.
