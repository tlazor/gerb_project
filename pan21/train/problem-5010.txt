The windows hibernation file "hiberfil.sys" resides at the top directory where your OS is installed, Ideally "C:\hiberfil.sys". This file is as big as your RAM is.
I am still not sure that even if your windows will be able to read your linux file system, will it actuall be able to utilize another kind of file system for hibernation, and other system specific tasks.
For Intel RST, I haven't had a chance to look at this technology yet :( I believe you set it in the BIOS/Raid setup or from the Intel Rapid Storage Technology program inside of Windows.
However, if you are selling this laptop, I think you are best off simply using the recovery disks - this will give the end use the out of box experience and everything else as if they had just purchased the machine.
Minor correction to the above.  The SSD in the S3 is used for Intel Rapid Start Technology, not Smart Response.  iRST is enabled/disabled in BIOS.   If you deleted the partition, you can recreate it using the instructions in the IRST user guide.  The guide contains some good general reading about the technology, too.  For those wishing to use part of the SSD for Linux, the guide states the hibernation partition must only be the same size or larger than main memory.  It should, therefore, be possible to use the majority of the SSD for a Linux installation.
My guess is that this 20GB SSD was simply the system drive and it booted from the main hard drive - or, something funky is going on with Intel RST technology and it was being utilized this way.
By Default, windows is not capable enough to read the linux file system, however this article might help.
Please remember that windows is never comfortable in handling hiberfile.sys, pagefile.sys if present outside the parent directory of the OS; if it is possible at all!
