For the next 60 hours the status said 'Resynching (X%)' as it built the array. during this time i did read and write to the drive (slowly) and once the rebuild was complete speeds were quite fast. I was copying over some data from a USB hard drive overnight, and the machine crashed (looking in the error i believe it was the driver for the usb drive) and so the RAID5 went back to resynching, since the machine was not shut down properly.
Just logged in and the rebuild was complete. Don't know why it never told me it's percentage, but it was a correct assumption that it was doing the resync all that time, just so people know.
The question is - is that a correct assumption? and why is disk management not telling me what %age it's done? Is this normal behaviour for a not-properly-shut-down r5 array?
The issue is, it's been about 48 hours since that started and I'm happy to say it will take roughly 60 hours again to resynch, however.. all this time in Disk Management, the status has only said 'Resynching', not 'Resynching (X%)'. The hard drive light is going nuts, and read/writes are slow again, so I'm assuming it is actually resynching.
