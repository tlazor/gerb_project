If these are Linux/Unix boxes, this (or the equivalent for the filesystem in use, if applicable) is often a powerful magic incantation for 'give me more space':
I faced a similar situation with a large Oracle database.  We had a Drobo (http://www.drobo.com) on hand (not the network enabled one) so I filled it with disks and connected it to my Mac laptop.  I shared the Drobo device out over NFS and copied the data onto it.  We did the maintenance required on the production storage and then copied the data to it.  Everything went pretty smoothly although it did take quite a while (500GB or so).
Get a HP Proliant G6 with 8 Disks at 300GB each, 12GB of RAM, 2 Quad Core Procs was about EUR 3-4K - and it takes only 1U
I would build an opensolaris based box with a supermicro AOC-SAT2-MV8 SATA Controller Card, and some hard drives. This way, if you ever need a place to keep files that are not super heavily utilized, there would be a place for them. A 6-7TB solution like this would put you far under the $1000 mark. It being ZFS means you can grow as you need to.
