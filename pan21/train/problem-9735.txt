It looks like the comments above have looked into netstat pretty thoroughly, which is a pretty promising route if you can get it going easily.
The other route is by monitoring the network traffic, either on the box itself or at the router/switch. Flow formats like NetFlow/IPFIX/J-flow/sFlow are all useful for getting summaries of communications between hosts, and are the usual method of determining who's making the most connections or using most of the bandwidth on a system. It's kind of like a phone bill for the network: you get the hosts, the ports, and the number of packets/bytes for each session. You can then pretty easily tally up who's doing what.
You'll need two things to make this work: a flow exporter (if you can't easily get flow from the switch/router there are probably a half dozen free Windows flow exporters you can run directly on the box; Google will turn them up pretty easily) and a flow collector (ditto) to receive the flow records and put them in a format you can use.
It's more work to do that than to use netstat, but I think the answer will be more definitive -- you'll get the number and timestamps of the accesses by IP address, and byte volumes, which ought to be more than enough to pick the right culprit(s).
