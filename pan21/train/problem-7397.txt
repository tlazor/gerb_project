I found that if I move the remote desktop connection dialog to the second monitor and run it that it will open the session there.  Then you can save that connection to a .rdp file and that should do it for you.
Using Windows 8.1 on an HP laptop screen on the left coupled with a large screen monitor on the right.
This worked for me, possibly you might also have to press Ctrl+Alt+Break as suggested in another comment to make the fullscreen work.
For me, I had to uncheck the option on the "Display" tab that says "Use all my monitors for the remote session". After unchecking that and connecting, I could maximize the RDP session on any monitor and it would not "stick" to one like before. One would think by the way it is worded you would want that checked, but I guess not in my case. Hope this helps someone else.
Now when I connect via RDP, I can raise the resolution under Options to match the 2nd monitor and it opens on the 2nd monitor or "main display"
In Windows 8 it's pretty simple and I guess you can do the same in Windows 7: Simply set the size of the remote desktop to the resolution of the secondary screen, open session and drag the window to the secondary screen. Maximize. Done.
Note:  This also brought my task bar (pinned items, tray, and clock) over to the big monitor which was not a deal-breaker for me.
Under "Change the appearance of your Displays", highlighting the large monitor 2 graphic and select "Make this my main display"
