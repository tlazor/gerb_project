I have looked this up and found that the alert 46 = "TLS1_ALERT_CERTIFICATE_UNKNOWN", which seems to be a generic error stating only that "something" is wrong with the certificate.
I have a webserver that is secured using an SSL cert from godaddy. The certificate seems to be working fine for about 30 clients, but one client cannot connect and I cannot for the life of me figure out why.
Can someone point me in the right direction? I need to figure out more details about the error and I have no experience in tracing these kinds of issues. Is there another log somewhere that I should be looking at?
The thing is though that the certificate seems to be working fine for everyone else except this one client. The client involved is using ColdFusion 10 with Java 7 to try to talk to the server and they are the only ones getting an error.
What's even more confusing is that up until the server was restarted a few days ago, this 1 client was working fine. So I know the server restart was the trigger but I can't find what's wrong.
