This behaviour is due to the fact that with TSO/GSO enabled, the TCP segment is split into MTU sized packets by NIC hardware. Since tcpdump captures at software layer, it sees segments larger than the MTU being sent to the NIC card for further transfer.
If you disable tso/gso for the NIC, then you will see all outgoing packets to be <= MTU size (more likely pMTU size).
I have a server that I am transferring data off of. We were having some problems that were traced back to the fact that the server is sending out jumbo size frames despite the fact that ifconfig is reporting that the MTU is 1500. How is this possible? The box is running CentOs 5, this is occuring over ipv4.
If you are capturing packets on the server then you might see TCP sending out larger segments than the MTU.  The packets on the wire , however, will be MTU size only. You can verify this by capturing on a network device (switch) etc. Alternatively capturing packets on the remote (client) machine will reveal that each packet is <= MTU .
