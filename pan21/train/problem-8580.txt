I'd like to separate 2 & 3 by granting groups rights correctly (e.g. site team full access to apache but nothing else). Problem is I also don't want to grant the user accounts rights , i'd like to them to enter "admin mode" like is done now because it's easily loggable and makes people realise that they can cause damage now.
The problem is that we currently open a root shell (sudo -i) for 2 & 3. This introduces risk because of full-access. Also we encounter errors from people with root access who overestimate their abilities (non-profit organisation so it's generally meant well).
We have 1 user account for everything (which is configured with detailed and correct groups for almost everything) in the NIS and generally it goes well.
Is it possible to create multiple levels of power instead of just the normal user/root differentiation?
You have two options, the most complex but most secure is mandatory access control (MAC) which can be accomplished via SELinux. The second is to configure your /etc/sudoers to grant a subset of control.
