How can I get Windows to use the correct display driver? Or, where can I find a driver for this graphics chip that will work with Windows 10x64? (I'd even attempt to install a Windows 8 version for that device if I can find it). Or, if all else fails, how can I get the MS Basic Display driver to use the full 1366x768 resolution for the screen on this computer?
Looking in the device manager, I see two entries for Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1). As part of my troubleshooting, I swapped the old Windows 7 disk back in and checked the driver there, and Mobile Intel 4 Series Express is the correct device. The only difference I see is two instances listed in device manager, rather than just one. 
I'm working on extending the life of an older laptop (late 2010-ish) by maxing out the RAM, upgrading to an SSD, and updating from Windows 7 to Windows 10.
Additionally, if I choose Advanced Display Settings when I go to try to change the resolution, I can see more information about the adapter and the monitor. This screen says the computer is using the Microsoft Basic Display Driver, in contradiction of what was shown by the device manager.
I added the new hardware and installed Windows on the laptop, and everything works well except the graphics driver. My only choices for screen resolution are 1024x768 and 800x600. I should be able to do 1366x768.
