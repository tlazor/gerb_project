So does anyone have any practical experience with zfs-fuse 0.6.9 on such (or simillar) configuration?
I ran ZFS-FUSE under Ubuntu for nearly a year without any issues before migrating the pool to OpenSolaris.  That said, the memory requirements for Dedup on a multi TB pool will likely exceed memory of your home linux server.  Dedup performance is terrible once your deduplication tables spill over from ARC (primary memory cache) unless you have an SSD for L2ARC to keep them readily available.  Without the dedup tables in memory a number of operations can become unbelievably slow (deletion of directory of files, snapshot deletion, etc). Snapshots can function w/o dedup and have nearly no overhead on their own, so unless your storing a lot of redundant and have 8-16GB of ram and/or an SSD to throw at the problem, I'd skip dedup.
I'm thinking of using ZFS for my home-made NAS array. I would have 4 HDDs in raidz on a Ubuntu Server 10.04 machine.
I'd like to use the snapshot capability and dedup when storing data. I'm not so much concerned about the speed, since the machine is accessed via N wireless network and that is probably going to be the bottleneck.
I have two 500GB drives in a zfs-fuse mirror setup on my home NAS (debian lenny). It has been running for almost 6 months now, and I have not had problems. More details here on my blog.
