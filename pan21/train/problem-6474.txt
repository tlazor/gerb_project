Increasing your RAM to at least 2GB will have a significant impact on your performance, but if you are aiming to increase game performance, you'll find your graphics card to be the primary factor.  I would suggest upgrading your graphics card as well as your RAM.  (I've personally had excellent experience with the 250 GTS.
Looks like your motherboard supports up to 8GB. So, if you're running Windows 7 64-bit, put at least 4GB in, and up to 8GB. If 32-bit, then just do 4GB. You should definitely be able to notice a difference.
Put as much RAM as you can afford or will fit in that system.  That will probably be your biggest bang for the buck on that system.  I would also kill any start-up programs or background processes that you don't need.
Define sluggish.  I'd think Windows 7 would run "ok" on your given configuration.  I suspect that your HD might be slow, dying, or fragmented at the very least.
Yes. For $60, i just upgraded an Inspiron 9300 running Windows 7 from 1GB to 2GB (the max) and i would have done 4GB if the laptop would support it. It ran W7 fine before but with more than one app open there was pretty significant and fairly regular disk thrashing. With 2GB it's calmed down quite a bit.
This is unsolicited (sorry), but if you want to stick with your system (not terribly outdated), i'd also look at getting a better graphics card. I had the excellent 6600GT in my previous tower system, but the 8800GT in my latest is worlds better. Win 7 loves a fast video card.
