In your case the “Windows service” template creates a bundle of these for you.  If you right click on the template in the authoring view you can dig down into all the objects that make up that template.  If you target say all “all windows computers” in the template, all agents will download this config, check to see if they have the service installed (discovery), then report the health status of the service (monitor) and capture metric data such as cpu/memory if configured in the template (rules).  After a few minutes you will see the monitors health status start to populate in the “Windows Service State” view.
Getting back to your question, you need to create a template for each service you want to monitor.  SCOM will discovery these on the applicable servers that you target.
SCOM can install agent software remotely to machines, this one of the few times the server will initiate a connection to the agent machine. Most of the time it’s the agents responsibility to initiate (and keep alive) a connection to the MS (Management Server).  The agent continuously watches to see if a new configuration is available for it and will download and process it when available.  You can view this happening in the agents “operations manager” windows event log.
SCOM does have a bit of a curve to it. In your case I just have a few comments that might help you get started.
The SCOM configuration is made of scripts and other info to tell the agent what to do (management packets).  Main objects you’ll work with are Discoveries (do I have X on the machine via registry check/file /wmi check etc), Rules (did something happen? Or Collect X performance counter), Monitors (is the light switch on or off).  This is overly simplified but you get the idea.
