Finding the minimum spanning tree can be solved by using the greedy approach that is it looks for the best local optimal solution at a given point of time. Your problem should be extension of the minimum spanning tree. your doubt is that we get two different MST $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ of equal weight w. let $e_1$ be the edge with minimum weight $w_{1}$ to be added to form $1-tree_1$ from $T_1 $and $e_2$ be the edge with minimum weight $T_{1}$ to form $1-tree_2$. 
Case 2:if there is no such $e_{z}$ till ith iteration. say at i+1 iteration there make different choice say $e1_{i+1}$ and $e2_{i+1}$. Weights of both of them should be same, otherwise there wont be difference choice. now next edge $e2_{i+1}$ can be added to $T_{1}$ if it does not form as cycle, similarly $e1_{i+1}$ value for $T_{2}$. if they are added then T_{1} and T_{2} remains same till i+2 iteration, if not say addition of e_{i+1} forms a cycle then e2_{i+1} will be e_{z} for T_{1} and e1_{i+1} be the e_{z} for the T_{2}. so both 1-trees have same weight.
Let $e_{1},e_{2}..e_{i}$ are the edges that are picked by both $T_{1}$ and  T_{2} upto i iterations,
case 1: In this process if there any edge $e_{z}$ with weight $w_{z} < w_{k}$  for any i=1,2..n is not choosen for MST then it means that it would have formed a cycle. so e_{z} will be the edge which would be added to MST to get a 1-tree. so both 1-trees will have same weight
