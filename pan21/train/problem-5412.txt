And here is the output of ifconfig on the VPN/SMB server when I'm connected to the VPN from another computer in a remote location:
Initially I had Firewall issues, where I could not connect to the VPN at all and in fact the SMB Shares were not visible. I essentially turned off the firewall temporarily to debug.
The server, which has the VPN and the SMB share is running Ubuntu Server 15.10. The clients are Windows 7, 8 and 10, as well as OSX El Capitan.
If I navigate to \192.168.42.10 from my Windows 7 machine while I'm on the VPN, it shows MY shares. Going to any of the other IPs doesn't do anything, or immediately says it is inaccessible.
I set up a VPN using L2TP and IPSEC (with LibreSwan) using this script: https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn
I have tried expanding and changing the hosts and interfaces in SMB.conf, and I had to some of the rules it added to iptables to use enp0s31f6 instead of eth0. I can connect to the VPN from my house or anywhere else just fine, but I never am able to connect to the shares on the VPN server.
From my samba logs, I see nothing about my computer trying to connect, which makes me think SAMBA is not accessible from the VPN connection?
The only change I had to make was to change the instances of 'eth0' to the new format of Ubuntu device naming. My devices are enp0s31f6 (primary) and enp3s0 (secondary, unused).
