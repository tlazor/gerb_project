I bought the same $30 upgrade from 741. When I purchased it, they gave me my key and the download site had two options:
So I'm thinking about purchasing the Windows 7 Upgrade through the student 741 deal they have for $29.99. Will the key I get also work with a regular, full install of Windows 7? I'm asking because I want to dual boot both XP and Windows 7, so I don't want to wipe out my version of XP.
I believe Microsoft would say that you have to upgrade XP to qualify for the upgrade license. This would mean that you can no longer use XP. 
Yes it will work, the upgrade disc will allow you to do a clean install.  That is the only option to upgrade from xp to seven.  If you buy the 29.99 student upgrade, you can do either an upgrade installation if your machine was running vista, or you can do a clean install if your machine is running xp.  When you go to load the os, you will notice that the "upgrade" option will be grayed out and the only option you can select is "custom".  Once you have selected custom you will have the option to blow out (format) the xp install or partition the drive for a dual boot.  Either way, the "upgrade" disc and product key will let you do a clean install to a machine with xp, or a machine with no OS for that matter.
If your media is not limited to a specific version you could install the lowest version onto a nominated partition, then upgrade that copy of Win 7 with your license key.
See Paul Thurrots Win Super site for details on the clean install upgrade and My Digital Life for information on how to make your installation media capable of installing any version on Win 7.
I did ask about the .iso option before I bought the upgrade, so if the option isn't there for you, just send them an email and they'll provide the link.
BTW, I went from XP, wiped it, and Custom installed Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (technically it is an "upgrade" license, and I did technically "upgrade")
