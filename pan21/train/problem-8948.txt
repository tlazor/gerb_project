I know I could use Irfanview or the sort, but I'd prefer to be able to use Photo Viewer. Is there any way I can bring it back?
I think because of your first attempt to run the .dll directly, the entry "Windows Photo Viewer" still points to the .dll instead of rundll32, which of course you can't run directly.
I have followed TechnoCore's answer, but as the comments indicated, the second part wasn't working for me either.
You can also use Winaero Tweaker to activate Windows Photo Viewer, as shown in the following screenshot. Just follow the description (within the green box), and you're all set.
In Windows 10, when opening images, it gives me the option to open in the Photos metro app, Paint, or GIMP.
If that doesn't work, try searching the registry for Windows Photo Viewer and photoviewer.dll to see if there are any references to photoviewer.dll being called directly (without rundll32).
I'd like it to open in Photo Viewer, but when I directed "Open with" to PhotoViewer.dll in "C:/Program Files/Windows Photo Viewer", or "C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Photo Viewer", I get a "This app can not run on your PC" error.
