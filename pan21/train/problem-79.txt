What I'm saying is, doesn't matter.  What does matter is that you didn't even mention your disk subsystem in your post, which means you're coming at this backwards.   Get whichever cpu is cheaper and focus on your disk and memory needs.
I'd probably go with the X5550, since it will give you a total of 8 threads, versus 6. You're using only one processor, so the X5550 might not be the most efficient processor choice; if you can, try to grab up an X3460.
As the others have said, you HAVE to go with the 55xx-series - we saw a seven-fold increase in overall Oracle 10g performance on our HP blades between the 54xx-series and 55xx-series - just the memory performance alone justifies their use. If it's performance per dollar or watt then AMD can be competitive but on pure performance Intel are way ahead of the game - and you should see how the forthcoming 75xx-series perform!
Database performance is very rarely CPU bottlenecked.  It is almost always disk i/o bottlenecked, and after that memory/cache bottlenecked, and after that network i/o bottlenecked.   If you had a CPU bottlenecked database you'd probably know it already because you'd have been special in several ways to get here.
