The fact that it happens only when idle makes it seem like it must be some sort of indexing/defragging service. To test, you could see if it makes the same sound when copying many small files to or from the drive. This makes the read/write head move between  the data area and the file table a lot which, on most drives, makes a grinding noise. If this noise and the "idle noise" are not similar, it may be a defective drive that is damaging itself when it spins down.
Is there a fan? If so is it clogged with dust? The fan man be slowing down on demand. Rare but possible.
Another possibility is your external hard disk is functioning improperly and I strictly recommend you to back up your important data ASAP. Since I did not hear the sound, these are my estimates at the moment.
You are very lucky that its making a sound and STILL working.  And I believe that you must know the difference between HDD activity sounds and BAD sounds, if it sounds like the scrapping of metal then just bin it while you can get your data off.
Assuming that sound is the normal sound of disk activity, one possibility is your system may be running a process like File Indexing Service which may be the reason of sound. Those services are generally activated when computer is idle and stops on usage. If this is the case, you should disable File Indexing for the external HD. 
If you ever hear scraping-clicking-anything that you have not heard before, and you know the sound it should make because you use your computer EVERY DAY- copy it off and back it up.
