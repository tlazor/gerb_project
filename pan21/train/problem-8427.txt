Our setup is quite simple, we are running two/three web servers (large instances) behind a ELB and a RDS (XL instance) instance to server the web servers.
We have just started to move our infrastructure to Amazon's AWS (EU West). Since we started the move we have started seeing some quite substantial spikes in network latency.
Is there anything we can do to improve the response time or is this something that we have no control over.
I read about the problems Amazon seemed to have in Jan 2010 (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/15/amazon_ec2_latency/) however haven't heard anything since thus assumed it was a brief period where this happened.
Our response time now ranges from abysmal to OK, today's values: 427 ms [London, UK] - 1,642 ms[London, UK] (values from Pingdom). With our previous provider (same setup, traditional managed hosting) we were used to seeing around 200 - 300 ms.
What do you guys think, is there something I can do or is it the penalty you have to use for Amazon's flexibility?
