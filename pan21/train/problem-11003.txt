That way all users on the system will benefit from any bash completion scripts installed in the directory "/opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/".
While the current answer is correct for older MacPorts there is a new issue with the most current MacPorts resulting in the same error.
Today macOS ships with Bash 3, but you can brew install bash to get Bash 4.  If you're running Bash 4, then install the newer 2.x branch of bash-completion.
All you need to do is place the git-completion.bash file in your user home bin directory and place the following in you .profile or .bash_profile file:
While the answer above by grundprinzip from 2011 still works fine, I wanted to add a more recent answer now that there's now a Homebrew package bash-completion (formula, repo) that makes this even easier.  (This includes completion for git as well as other common tools.)
So, no MacPort install to then install a the "completion" version of GIT (especially irritating if you already have it installed).
The current bash-completion package (2.0 r1) requires at least a bash 4.1 to function properly. As a usual OS X Terminal uses /bin/bash it only gets a 3.x. You have to change you terminal settings to use /opt/local/bin/bash -l as described in the MacPorts documentation here: http://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/bash-completion
What this does is make sure that your local bin is in the PATH and the source command gets things going. Then of course the PS1 change puts the currently checked out branch in the prompt.
