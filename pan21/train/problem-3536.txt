As for the second question, you can configure them however you like, just make sure the web server will answer for them and provide the appropriate HTTP-level redirection as desired (remember, DNS won't redirect the browser's address request to another URL).
You'll also need to set up your webserver to answer on those names. Here's an example of doing so in Apache:
To actually change the URL that's displayed in a client's address bar, that would need to be done on server side with mod_rewrite, and is not a function of DNS.
Option B.  Use CNAME records to specify aliases for existing A records. Same applies to the blog & www.blog entries. Choosing the CNAME record allows you to change the actually IP in one location (the A record).  If you make all entries as A records you would need to update each individually. 
This lets you change your A record for mydomain.com without disrupting your mail record or having to change each subdomain by hand.
In the first question, you can do it either way.  The only real impact of having one as a CNAME is that when that name is looked up, it will cause a second DNS lookup in some cases to go fetch the name it's pointing to (so now I look up www.example.com and get a pointer to example.com and have to go look that up to actually get the IP).  The difference is usually on the order of milliseconds, and sometimes the pointer's IP will be included in the response as well if the server knows about it, avoiding the second look up.  It still creates larger DNS packets though.  I prefer just defining them as A records and using CNAMEs for hosts outside my own domain.
And to make it also accessible when user is typing www.blog.mydomain.com, I also insert the following record:
