You can user the above linux libraries (foremost libnss-ldap and pam_ldap) together with some changes to your PAM configuration to enable Windows user accounts on Linux servers (this can also be linked through Kerberos, which will allow linux users to update their AD passwords and their local passwords at the same time).
We use Active Directory for (almost) everything. ADS has an LDAP interface built-in, and there are client libraries available for user authentication on Linux machines (you will need the Windows Services for Unix). 
You can add "Application" entities to your Active Directory, and then define specific security groups within these. Then configure the various clients to use these groups to gain very fine grained control over access to your various applications and portals. (use the "AD Users and Groups" plugin on a Windows domain controller to do this).
If you need more info, let me know and I can forward a whole raft of sample files on how to make this work. Works a treat for us.
I think you are on the right track there. We have a very similar setup, although we also have a fair few Windows server in the mix. And our user base is 70% Linux (mostly Debian) and 30% MS Windows.
