The emulator will keep feeding HDCP and EDID info of your monitor, so your system (specially for Windows 7) will still "think" the monitor is on, even you power-off your monitor. 
( 'XXXX' means device number. There are several device number folder and u should find 'AdapterDesc' in 0000 folder which key value is 'amd radeon HD 7XXX Series'. )
Set display size and frequency. I recommend 60 hz unless you know for sure it can handle other frequencies as this is default for any monitor.
Have a look at your services, the graphics card may have a service to detect this such as "AMD External Events Utility" or "ati hotkey poller". Disable it and see if that makes a difference.
More and More OSs (such as Windows 7 and some linux...) request to check the connected devices' status frequently and automatically (not just checking the display status, but also checking USB keyboard/mouse or speaker....etc).  If devices are turn-off or disconnected from the PC system, the OS will issue a HPD (hot-plug Detect) error.  So far, there still no way to turn this feature off under Windows 7.
