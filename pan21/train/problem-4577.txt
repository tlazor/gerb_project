I have a bunch of legacy servers (about 30) running undocumented code that still run on RHEL4. Some newer servers run on CentOS5 or 6, but most of them are RHEL4. Following a security audit, management has finally agreed that something needs to be done and the servers need to be migrated to something from this (or next) decade. The servers mostly run open source applications, like cacti, mysql, php, apache, perl with some of them having Oracle bindings to query such databases.
According to me, it worth the effort of developping a playbook to build/configure the new centos8 systems (packages, network cfg, users, ssh keys...).
This, or course means re-installation (on VMs or maybe containerizing what can be easily done), but I haven't found a plan/checklist/automation tool to help me get started.
Is there a recommended way of doing such upgrades? Are there tools, scripts, procedures that can help me make it less painful? 
I was thinking of writing ansible playbooks to do all this in the hopes that it would make future upgrades easier, but writing playbooks has a higher overhead than actually doing the one-time config, so I'm not sure it's worth the effort...
But the applications migration would have to be done manually, because each case would be different. You have to understand how the app is started (/etc/rc3.d should be a good starting point), what are the dependencies (lib/packages) and how those deps were installed (tarball ? package ?), is there any crontab associated, what are the new lib versions available on centos8, is there any application code changes involved by the new library version, is there any config file syntax changes.
Try to build an application matrix from old production, and deploy a test environment for each application you have identified. Once everything is working fine, you can think on how you can speed up deployment on new prod environment, and also deal with data migration.
