If you are successful, you will have to convert windows installation partition to extended using same software. There, by logical, they actually mean extended partition.
Then, create a new logical drive in there for ubuntu and install ubuntu as ubuntu can install on logical drive unlike windows which installs only on primary partition.
Hence, if you go and create a new partition, it will ask you to convert the disc to dynamic which is what you have done.
So, had you not converted the disc to dynamic, the solution would have been converting the windows installation partition to extended and creating logical drives.
Make sure the disk has 4 primary partitions.(Basically revert the disk partition layout to what it was BEFORE you converted it to dynamic)
Try converting disk to basic as specified here.(I have not tested this part. So you will have to experiment.)
Normally we have at most 3 primary partitions and an extended partition(which itself is primary). And within this extended partition, you can create 26 logical drives.
