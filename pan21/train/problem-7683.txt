I went all 64-bit on every piece of hardware that supports it as soon as I could and I have no regrets.  At work we are running PostgreSQL servers on 64-bit CentOS 5 with 32 GB RAM and it is pretty great (Except for certain limitations with PostgreSQL itself, but nothing to do with 32 or 64 bits.)
If you want to increase your memory, you have no choice, but to run a 64bit kernel. You can keep a 32bit userland if you want, but each process will be limited to a maximum of 2GB (maybe 3GB). You shouldn't need to reinstall everything, just a new kernel.
If you choose to run 64-bit Slackware, you only really have one choice: Slackware64. Slamd64 was an unofficial port of Slackware which has ceased to be necessary now that Slackware has an official 64-bit port. In terms of versions, you have the choice of the 13.0, 13.1, 13.37 and -current releases of Slackware64. Also note that 14.0 will likely be released soon, so you could also wait for that. 
64bit + more ram, if you're using innodb then set your inndb_buffer_pool_size to about 70-75% of your total system ram.  Tune cache sizes.  If you're using recent versions of MySQL set your /tmp directory to use tmpfs (memory) which will allow MySQL to create temp tables in memory rather than on physical disk.  Make sure MySQL is then configured to use /tmp for temp tables.
