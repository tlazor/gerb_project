You could also bring the computer to a computer repair shop, and pay a professional to take care of the problem.  I mean, this is a complex electronic device that costs as much as a used car... just because it fits on a desk doesn't mean that everyone and their brother should be able to fix it themselves.

A new window “Services” will be displayed. A lots of services are listed in this window. Search for “Program Compatibility Assistance Service” in the list. Right click on this service and select “Stop“.
If you want to know if it is an infection, you could always use Anti-Virus tools.  There are multiple different suites out there... and your computer most likely came with one.
You want a solution?  Perform a factory recovery based on your computer manufacturer's instructions.  If there is nothing wrong with any of your hardware (your Ram is good, hard drive is good, etc.) then this should take care of your issues.
A “Program Compatibility Assistance Service Properties” window will appear. Under “General” tab in the “Startup type” section, click on the drop-down menu and select “Disabled“.
Now the Program Compatibility Assistant is disabled. To get effect restart your computer. To check the Program Compatibility Assistant is disable or not open the task manager (Ctrl+shift+Esc) and search for “PcaSvc” service under the service tab. Hopefully, you don’t find this service in the task manager. Finally you have done your job sucessfully.
Why?  Who knows... Sure.  It could be an infection.  Could be bad memory.  Could be a failing hard drive.  Could be a really messed up installation of Windows.  Could even be that the programs weren't installed correctly.  Impossible to give you a definitive answer though, based on the information you have supplied.
