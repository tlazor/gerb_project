Unless your friend is technically competent and aware of the security implications of running a system that has no further security updates, do not give them this laptop, it will very likely result in them being compromised one way or another.  
I have a laptop running on windows XP with IE 8.  I have not used it in years and was going to give it to a friend.  Everything seems to work but many websites are refusing connection due to the windows and IE combination.  How do I update either windows or IE or both to make the machine useable.  
Right now, I cannot connect to Yahoo, Google or any common search sites to download software updates.
Upgrading to Windows 10 would be an option if your laptop specs are sufficient, otherwise you could consider a linux OS.
XP is out of support, as is IE8.  Using a different browser is an option, but as the IE engine is still going to be used for things like email, or the IETab option suggested by a commenter, it will still expose a vulnerable browser to the internet.
