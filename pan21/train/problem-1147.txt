I used the logger feature in the uBlock Origin browser extension to see what requests are made when accessing that page on www.iplocation.net. While doing this, the page showed me two IP addresses as "proxies": my own IP address, and another incapsula.com address. This makes me think the proxy detection at www.iplocation.net is not currently entirely reliable.
I also note that this page seems to include some advertising for VPNs. Although the odd "proxy" reporting may be a honest mistake, the fact that they don't explain their "proxy" results in any further detail makes me think it might possibly be deliberate to make the readers worry about their security... and perhaps then buy a VPN.
It appears the page includes some references to "incapsula.evyy.net". Looks like this evyy.net is acting as a reverse proxy for Incapsula, and the address finder page detects this and lists it in the "proxy" section. In other words, it is a side effect of www.iplocation.net's own structure. 
The "proxy" IP address 198.143.56.17 is not on your network: it does not have even the same prefix as yours.
