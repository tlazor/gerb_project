You can also use a tool like readspeed to monitor the speed of the transfert of zeros (it's the data speed transfert, which is to the speed of the connection minus the ethernet/ip/tcp headers)
I'm interested in stress testing my gateway server but am lost on how. Most of the stress testing applications I've seen only see how much load an app like Apache can handle, but not this.
Simplest stress test uses netcat. That's just for the flow rate though. If you want to stress the speed of opening and closing connection, you need something else.
Essentially I want to send as many packets I can into this box with one computer on one card and see how many come out the other in another computer just to get an idea of what kind of load this can handle. I'm also interested how Snort will perform. I'm not really sure how to do this though.
FreeBSD and Linux have packet generator in kernel. It is very high speed. FreeBSD have ng_source node to generate packets. Linux have pktgen. but they are harder to use than userspace applications.
If you are just looking at doing raw TCP/UDP packets (network testing) I would look at iperf. It supports both UDP and TCP.
