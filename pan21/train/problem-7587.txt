Is it possible to make a proxy server (or load balancer) that only redirects an incoming connection to a server instance without serving as a mediator of the open socket traffic during active connection?
I am developing a server side software which uses ASIO for TCP socket communication between client and server. All is done in C++ because the software is used for extremely fast low latency data transfers.I need an ability to distribute incoming client connections between different instances (processes) of my server. So I learned a new term - load balancer. Now, because I use C++ and ASIO I started looking for available open source libraries. I found this. What I understood was that this is a proxy server which mediates the connection between client and server. That's, it maintains a bridge between the two.
Again, what I finally want is that my loadbalancer gets incoming connection request from a client, then "tells" my server to grab that connection info (like IP address for example) and from then on proceed with direct connection between the server and the client.
