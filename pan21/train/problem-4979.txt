Then use an app like teamviewer running in your "server" pc (that is connected with the disks) to access the data remotely.
(I would prefer to have the main router with a dynamic IP but I have a spare one I could use for the server with static IP if needed.)
The latter two make multiple disks act as one, while the first is like a data server (you probably can do combinations, or just make each disk usb external)
I have 3 SATA laptop Hard Drives which I would utilise in some way, preferably I would like to join them together (though USB) to my old PC (really old - 500MB of RAM) and somehow use that as a home "server" so that I can access any of the files from the computers around my house (Linux and Windows). How hard would that be to do? Could you include some easy-to-follow setup tips?
Also would it be possible to access the information remotely (outside of my LAN) through the internet? Is that something I would have to pay for?
You can create a NAS (network attached storage), or RAID cluster whith these 3 drives if they are the same, or JBOD (just a bunch of disks).
