Assuming OS X, although instructions should be very similar for Windows. Open iTunes -> Preferences -> Advanced. Click Change… beside iTunes Media folder location. Select a new location. Click OK.
The above script looks promising. As usual, you should back up your files before doing either of the above just in case!
Well, you can manually do it by exporting the list of music in your library by right clicking the Music in the top left frame and selecting "Export." Then you could compare this to what is inside of your iTunes folder.
I believe there are music files in my iTunes folder that aren’t in my library. How can I remove these files?
This seemed kind of tedious and figured someone out there had already come up with an easier method:
Then head to File -> Library -> Organize Library…. Click Consolidate files. This will copy all files in your iTunes library to your new location, and will not copy files that are not in your library. Once the copy is completed, delete your old iTunes Media folder. If you like, you can repeat the process to consolidate files back to your original location.
