To answer the main question, Cholesky's suggestion of a table is a good one, but if you want to reduce the number of cases you have to select values for then one approach would be to store for each material a base restitution and a weight with which to take a weighted average. What restitution is really about is how much of the energy of the collision is converted into forms other than the post-collision kinetic energy of the bodies. Sound can be neglected: what you're interested in is deformation. So give easily deformed materials such as soft sand a high weight and a low restitution and you have a model which should be good enough.
After all, games only have to feel right to the player: they don't have to be accurate simulations of the real world.
I personally think that taking the largest one make the most sense: (throwing a bouncy ball at a brick bounces even though a brick has no restitution to speak of), but if you have a game where you need to model complex bouncy interactions you could store a "material" per body and build up a materialA vs. materialB lookup table.
