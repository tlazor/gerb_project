The problem only shows up if you don't shut them down, but rather hibernate/sleep the VMs.  When you don't shut it down, it's possible when you resume them that they may be seen as a whole new instance, and can't rejoin the domain, because there is already another server with the same name.  Then you essentially have to reformat, because since it can't rejoin, you can't demote it. The other domain controller will have equal issues with replications.
As far as hosted VMs, the only consideration I really ever give pause is when the child OS (server 2008 R2 in this case) will cause a lot of disk activity.  
Paradroid brings up a good point, but I think he was being too broad.  It is fine to run a domain controller on a VM.  Where you want to be careful is when you have 2 domain controllers on two VMs replicating to each other.
You will probably find it better to connect to it through RDP, using rdesktop, rather than the VirtualBox console.
As long as you do not intend using it as a domain controller, I cannot think of any possible problems you could have.  It should be fine.
Moral of the story is don't sleep/ hibernate the VMs.  If you are in a hurry, then just pull the plug on the VMs, rather than issuing a shutdown.  The chances of corruption are much much lower than sleeping/hibernating.
Will there be any issues installing and then subsequently running a Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 installation on a VirtualBox VM on a Linux host (Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit)?  I require Windows Server 2008 R2 for a course I'm taking, and I dont have any systems to install/deploy it onto.
