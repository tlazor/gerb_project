You have nothing to worry about. I have a USB 2.0 WD EHDD and a USB 3.0 WD EHDD and have observed that the USB 2.0 one does have slightly higher chances of getting disconnected if you physically move it, since the micro-USB port is indeed small and connects to the cable in a comparatively fragile way. Its a problem only if you have files on it that are open or have some process running/accessing-files on it. At other times you may experience an annoying intermittent disconnect-reconnect operation when you try and move it.
For reference, a 3.5" Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 hard drive is rated to withstand operating shock of up to 70 g's (see page 16 (PDF page 22) of the manual for the Barracuda 7200.12).
Anyway, moving an external drive would have the same risk as moving an entire laptop, so just be careful and don't move or shake them more than necessary.
I believe some disks have some sort of protection, and they "park" when moving, that is, the head gets out of the way, to prevent damage, but not sure.
At the end, if you need to move the drive while operating, try to keep it always horizontal (or better said, keep it in the same position / direction you had it before moving, but most disks are used standing horizontally). Or just disconnect it and wait a bit for it to stop spinning.
And the disk does spin for a short while after being disconnected. As long as you have ejected it right, you are free to physically disconnect the device. 
I'm not an expert, and I'm saying this only by deduction, but think that the safest way to move an operating hard drive, is to keep it always horizontal. That is because, of the gyroscope effect, the resits to change direction. If you change direction suddenly, odds are that the spinning discs (plates) could crash with the reading needle/head, just as you suspected.
