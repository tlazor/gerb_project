Sadly this normal setup is rarely used for home users. The Internet has grown bigger than anticipated and we have almosr run out of IP ranges to give to people. To work around this many setups no longer request their own public IP range. Instead they use a single IP from their provider.  On the inside network they use RFC1918 IPs which are not routed and which are not reachable from the rest of the world. 
Now it gets ugly. Your ISP as also doing this ugly thing called NAT. As a result your B890's external IP is behind one and is unreachable. There are the same workarounds, but this time they would need to be done on the routers from your ISP, who is unlikely to cooperate.
This is called NATting and it breaks many things. But sadly it is needed with the current number of Internet users and IP v4. We could simply improve this (and we did, sicne 20 years we have IP v6 which solves this). But as long as most providers only provide IP v4 access we are stuck with NAT and workarounds sunch as port forwarding.
All your devices (including the gateway) have their own public IP and can be reached.  The B890 would have to different IPs, and you can reach it from anywhere in the world without any problems.
Devices at '2' ISpwards should be reachable and youy should be able to reach the public external IP on yout B890.
When you see a private IPv4 (10.x.x.x, 172.[16-20].x.x, 192.168.x.x) on the WAN interface of any router, that means there is another device between you and the public internet that is doing another Network Address Translation step.  If there's a cable/satellite/DSL/wireless modem connecting your Huawei to your ISP, check that device's WAN port for public/private IP.  If not, your ISP may have a way to map a port through, or a public IP, but likely will cost more.
