I use iptables and DHCP server to share Internet connection. When I enable VPN, both Local1 and Local2 traffic goes through VPN, without VPN both local networks go directly to Internet.
ex.commands: iptables -I FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
First you have to change VPN configuration to not setup itself as a default gateway. What VPN is this? 
I have CentOS Linux 6 based software router. I have 2 local networks, lets say Local1 and Local2. I have one Internet connection, and I have VPN connection that I run via this Internet one.
My question follows: how to set up CentOS based software router to forward one local network via VPN and another one directly?
Then you can add the static route which will forward traffic to the local1 subnet to the VPN gateway.
I also believe priority matters. Be sure the route for the VPN Network has a higher priority than your default route.
Most likely, your VPN consists of only a specific network (or set of networks).  You would want to set up Split Tunneling to say in Pseudo: "Any traffic destined for 'VPN network,' go through VPN Connection."  Then your 0.0.0.0 default route would be all set up to go out through the internet connection.
You need to use VPN without default gateway defined, so all your traffic will goes through old default gateway.
