I really think that with 2gB your only options are more RAM or Linux, else you will forever have performance problems.
4gB seems paltry for Windows. If you don't want to upgrade RAM, would you consider switching to Linux, where that would be more than enough? It has equivalent apps for all of those you list (except for Zoom meetings, maybe - I don't know what that is).
p.s I am a fairly heavy multi-tasker & also like to run a VM which also needs RAM. I have always had 16gB in my laptop, but with my newest have 32gB. I find that I don't really need it, so 8 or 16gB  would seem to be ideal. You might want to buy one 8gB, rather than 2@4, so as to leave a slot open for second if you need it (depending on your budget).
The best performance booster on any PC is always more RAM. More of that much, much rather than a more powerful CPU. 
Are the Windows 10 minimum hardware requirements enough? quotes Microsoft minimum requirements as:  
You can get 4gB laptop RAM for just under $20, and your laptop should be able to take 2 of those (2@4 will be cheaper than 1@8).
