I can't do this with the Default Programs utility that comes with Windows 7, because it only works with extensions that have been 'encountered'.
At the minimum, you need to create one registry key which gives notepad++ an ID and path and then one for each extension you wish to register to use it.
I am thinking for the future, wouldn't it be grand to have some kind of batch file that could automatically associate a selection of file extensions with N++ at the click of a button, rather than having to wait until I encounter all these extensions then go through the rigmarole of navigating to the N++ exe etc.
I've just recently reinstalled Windows and in setting up my environment I've noticed that all my associations for the various programming languages I edit in Notepad++ have gone (naturally).
Save this file with the extension .reg and you should now be able to re-associate all the extensions just by double-clicking on this file and confirming you want to import the entries into the registry.
