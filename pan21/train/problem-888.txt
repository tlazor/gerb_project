WLM isn't the best option anymore - not since MS decided to make it an 'ad serving platform', but the best (or only I think) option for Open source is Jabber, otherwise known as the XMPP protocol. Which is a secure, encrypted protocol BTW.
You can run a chat server yourself, and secure that. No need to run on Google's Gtalk network (which is XMPP) or others. There's a load of server and client software on the XMPP website.
Why not use Windows Live Messenger video chat? Or if you want to go really techy and secury you can install your own SIP proxy and with the above mentioned VPN and a variety of SIP clients you can make your own platform, so to speak.
If you access Gmail using https (which is the default setting now) and use their video chat software, then the connection to Google's servers will be encrypted, which would secure you against any sniffing on an unencrypted WiFi network, etc. Google would have access to the data, but I don't think they keep logs of video chats, just text chats. It's supported on Windows, OS X and Linux, and is very easy to install. I've been using it lately, and it seems to work quite well.
