And my job, as an active directory administrator, is to make sure that all those buckets, keys and names etched on each are all up-to-date, working well, removed when no longer useful or needed. In addition, I build NEW doors that protect NEW rooms, mill the new keys that allow access and even water and grow the tree that holds all of it together."
See it like a cross breed of an SQL server with a network file share, take the best bit of these two technologies, throw it away and whats left is Active Directory (or for that matter any LDAP). 
Now imagine that everything you usually do to configure a single PC, like setting up users, groups, printers, network shares, access rights and the such can be stored in a specific place and applied to any (multitude) of computer(s) willing to access that specific place.
"See, imagine a giant tree with a bunch of buckets on the limbs. Inside these buckets are little keys that grant you access to special doors that live in an area, past the tree. If your name matches a name etched on one of those keys in one of those buckets, you get to open the door that matches that key and access the special information that's stored in there."
There was a discussion on this topic at mailing list on activedir.org (THE BEST mailing list for Active Directory. PERIOD.)
What I recall was, Microsoft wanted AD database to be so robust and self-healing that normal DBA kind of activity should not be required nor a special DBA. At that time (early or mid 90's) SQL DB technology was not robust enough for AD's intended purpose. 
I don't have commenting rights (low reputation), so just assume that this answer is comment to Evan's answer about why not SQL server ?
