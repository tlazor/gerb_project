I've not had to set up something like this on my own in the past; I'm used to having it already configured so I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it.  I want to set up the workstation for remote access.
However, what happens is that when I try to connect to mypc.mycompany.com, it connects instead to the network server that's already set up, and not to my computer.  I can only imagine this has something to do with the fact that the IP for the router is the same for both computers, but shouldn't port forwarding ensure that it's sent to the right.
I want to set up my work laptop to enable me to use Remote Desktop to connect to it from home, like I can with our network server.  Using ZoneEdit, I have the domain mypc.company.com pointing to the IP address of our router, let's say the IP is 66.45.192.180 (that's not the real IP of it).  The server also points to this router, since it's own IP address is, obviously, internal to our network.
On the router itself (it's a Linksys), I have port range forwarding configured so that requests for port 3399 (Remote Desktop) from mypc.company.com should be forwarded to the IP address of my workstation, which is 192.168.1.201.  I also have it configured so that dev.mycompany.com forwards to the server, 192.168.1.200.
