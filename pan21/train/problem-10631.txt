I usually use malware bytes to remove stubborn viruses. Most of the time it is much better to just nuke the hard drive and freshly install the operating system. A deep rooted virus can take vital system files with it whenever you try to remove the virus. This can cause instability and cause a lot of system errors. If you do decide to use a removal approach instead of a reformat, make sure that you use 2 or 3 well known virus removers since not every kind will catch every strand of virus.
The details for whether a malware removal tool will affect all accounts or just one is dependent on that particular tool.  However, wiping the harddrive will guaruntee every trace is gone (usually).  Malware removal tools may leave pieces of malware scattered about.
The best way would be to wipe the harddrive and then reinstall everything, reinstalling the anti-virus program first, then anti-spyware.  This will fix all the accounts.
But seriously, without wiping and reinstalling the OS there is no way to be sure. If you absolutely can't reinstall you at minimum must boot from a different drive to clean it.
