Since traces are very narrow, use a single hair or a pin to paint; bridging (short-circuiting) traces can be damaging. This would be a fragile fix, and might benefit from being covered with tape or epoxy as reinforcement. There's no guarantee the repair will work, especially if there's water damage. [Pure water will likely dry without harm but salt water is very corrosive, particularly if there was a battery or the power supply was on].
I've broke the component which holds the keyboardfoil in attempt to remove that keyboard. Also a small amount of water got in probably.

If internal traces on a multilayer board are damaged, it would be difficult to fix (one would need to know what trace was broken inside the board and bridge it with a wire), but for a surface trace and connector, you could try automobile rear-window defroster repair liquid, which dries to a conductive silver.
