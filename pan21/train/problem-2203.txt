I am trying to get whitelisted for my work to access an internal app from the web, but I'm getting a timeout error. Our sys admin says that I am whitelisted and should be able to access the app.
Although it is common for ISPs to configure their DHCP server to remember the customer's line ID so that the line always gets the same address regardless of the device's MAC address, it is not usually the default way that the equipment works.
I did some troubleshooting and my public IP address while i'm connected to my router is different than my public ip address when connecting directly through the modem. (Using whatismyip.com for the public address)
ISPs assign IPv4 addresses to customers in various ways, but the simplest option is to not do it at all, and to just have a DHCP pool that each client device (CPE) takes an address lease from, with no accounting for lines or ports or subscribers. (Assuming the connection provides Ethernet emulation and doesn't require PPP or similar.)
In that situation, if you connect two different devices with different MAC addresses and they both request a DHCP lease, they will naturally receive different IP addresses. And because the lease typically lasts from a few hours to days, the DHCP server (and occassionally the client, too) will remember the lease and "resume" the same IP address. It works like that for your LAN's DHCP server, and it works like that for the ISP's WAN DHCP server.
I don't know how your specific ISP works (for that matter, you haven't even revealed what your ISP is), but what you describe is just how regular DHCP works.
