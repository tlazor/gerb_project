Strangely, I had the same issue and rebooting did not solve the problem. I am using a Toshiba Satelite A135-S4527 with a Microsoft USB mouse. I plugged it in to a different USB port and that solved the problem. Whatever works...
At the very least, you may need to "Logout" of the current session and "Restart X server" from the login / welcome screen. 
In your computer BIOS, you may need to enable what I call the "USB Legacy Support". I don't know how it may be called on your own system, but I was having problems with some USB devices in the past, and once the option was enabled, I had no more problem. 
You can also view the X server's log (/var/log/Xorg.0.log) files to see if there are any errors or warnings about the Mouse device. Check for (EE) or (WW) and look at the end of the file for output such as: 
Also please confirm that the mouse is functioning and is recognized by the Linux kernel, by running lsusb. 
If you added the mouse while running (Ubuntu) and while logged in, it is possible the X setup does not handle "hot-plug" support for the pointer device. Historically X11 didn't tend to, but I don't know if this has been changed in newer X server (X.org) versions.
