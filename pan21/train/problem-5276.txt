This leads to a discussion of the Apollo Guidance Computer itself. Low-level details like a 16-bit 2.048 MHz processor on a 70-pound machine contrasts heavily with the magnitudes of order faster devices we have now. There's a great perspective to be gained, especially in terms of speed and memory. 
In short, yes. When introducing students to programming and how a computer works, historical perspective can prove highly valuable in several areas. Consider this one image of Margaret Hamilton next to NASA code:
An additional resource I'd recommend for integrating the historical development of computers and computing is Brian Kernighan's book D is for Digital. It weaves in historical information throughout as a way of explaining just how we have arrived where we are now. Its examples are even more recent, so it provides an insight into just how much and how fast advancement has been recently. My students are reading part of it for summer reading, and here is the guide I made with sample questions that might related to your goal of teaching history: D is for Digital Reading Guide.
