Need to be noted, that this is actually will not conceal your IP from mail server, this trick just removes that info from the header. For real anonymity, you should use some kind of anonymization software, such as Tor.
Because the IP addresses in the "Received" headers are stamped on by the mail servers, it's not possible for clients to remove them - you need a complicit mail server working to keep your IP out of the record.
TorBirdy is a plugin for Thunderbird.  It tries to anonymize your connection and deletes or changes several informations.
You could set up a mail server that acted as a relay.  Since you would control the relay software, you could use any mail server software that allowed you to strip/anonymize connection info.
But this behaviour is reversible, just create mail.smtpserver.default.hello_argument parameter with a example.com string value via Thinderbird's Config Editor (Preferences > Advanced > General). You can assign anything instead of example.com, of course.
According to RFC 821 e-mail client should send its domain name in the Helo/EHLO command. So the answer is yes, Thunderbird sends out the IP in e-mail headers.
Some mail providers, such as Hushmail, strip all IP information from mail before forwarding along.  But this is, in general, only a service provided by secure or anonymous email services, not something you can make your existing provider do.
