I feel many people find themselves in similar situations and do not know exactly what to do or how to properly start "fresh" with their computers. Hence, why I ask the following questions.
I am in a situation now, where I would like to start fresh with my computer, but I am reading online that simply reinstalling Windows (including the partitioning and deleting of the everything on the drive) can sometimes not be effective in removing certain viruses. I then read further, and heard about, zeroing the hard drive (think Darik's Boot and Nuke, it fills the drive with random data) which can help in data deletion and  also virus removal when doing a complete reinstall. (Although maybe I am getting this wrong?)
I feel that many the average computer users come across a similar situation to what I am in now. A situation where these users find that their computers are infected with difficult to remove viruses, malware, spyware, or etc. Most often it seems that it is more time and/or cost effective for the average computer user to fully delete and partition the hard drive, and then reinstall the operating system. 
I am also aware that viruses may infect files that I have backed up on an external drive. Which would make it somewhat pointless to put those backed up files back onto a "fresh" computer as those files may reinfect the "fresh" computer.
