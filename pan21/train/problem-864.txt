You can edit /etc/network/interfaces file directly. To mount the SD-card properly, you need to do it on a linux machine. It should work, because I've done it several times.
You might use UTP cable to connect Raspberry Pi with your PC and set the proper network address (e.g. 10.0.0.2 - from your example) on the PC to get access to Raspberry Pi.
If you RPi is using a wired network connection and you hard coded the IP information, just plug a PC into that same network and configure it also with a hard coded IP address in the same range, then locate it using nmap. Multiple IP subnets can co-exist on the same network/switch.
If I understand you correctly you got new numbering for the private network when getting new router. If that is the case, that is also the reason why you can't find the Raspberry Pi on the network.
You need to be clear: Is your RPi on a wired or wireless network? If it's wireless and you didn't configure your new router with the exact same wireless settings, you will have to connect it via a wired connection and try to locate it. Plugging an Ethernet cable from your RPi to the router should work, assuming the router hands out DHCP addresses and your RPi is still using DHCP for the Ethernet interface.
