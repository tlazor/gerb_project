The reason for remove the "Users" and "Authenticated Users" group from the root was that as soon as the new user had logged in, they were given all the permissions of those groups - leaving us access to the files/directories as normal through the "Administrators" group.
This means that we still have full control with our normal login, but the new user can only change their sub-sub-directory (despite also being able to see all files in the root).
We are trying to setup the FTP on our stand-alone dedicate Windows Server 2003 (Standard, 32bit, SP2) IIS6.  We are NOT using AD.
In IIS6 I have created a virtual directory using the username (as the user mentioned above) as the alias - logging into FTP using the credentials puts them straight into the directory, which is correct and what I'm after.  But I cannot find any way of blocking them from navigating outside of "their" structure.
It is NOT setup for user isolation, as I need the "administrator" account to be able to access any part of the D: drive (which the FTP has setup as it's root).
I have tried Denying them permission at the root of the D: drive, but of course the Deny  overrides any attempt to Allow them permission in "their" directory.
I want to be able to restrict a single user account (created on the local box) to only be able to access a particular sub-sub-directory structure on the drive.  I do not want to allow this user to read/write/navigate to any other part of the D: drive.  If necessary I can accept directory listings, but certainly nothing more than that.
Thanks to Bad Dos, he has sent me roughly in the right direction and I have figured out a way of setting up the permissions that works for us.  As he says, our current FTP setup is not ideal, and we will look at changing it in the near future.
I have also tried creating a group, so that should I need to I can add other users into this group and they will also be denied access to anything that isn't their directory structure.
