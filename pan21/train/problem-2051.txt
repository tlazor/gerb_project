Well I've just found a PC that isn't one of mine on the network and I'd like to get more info about, such as what OS it is (this would give me a better understanding of which neighbour it is). And even possibly send a message to them.
How can I go about this, I can't use 3rd party software as I don't have access to the PC as it's my neighbours.
Well i can't put a password on my wifi, because everytime I do that the connection drops every 5 minutes or so on all wired and wireless PCs. I'm not happy about it but I keep a check of all the computers that connect to it
So how do I find out more info using their ip address (or Mac address)? And is it possible to message them (something like netsend, though I'm pretty sure the computer is not XP as it shows up on network Map)
Most routers are Linux based and some have a command line interface that you can enter commands at to achieve the desired effect.  Some extra tools on your main machine may be needed...
If you really want to know that much, just open up Wireshark (or any packet sniffer) and check on what they're doing.
