My second question is, how do I set up the access point (or is it a bridge)? I followed the instructions on the Netgear website; when I log in to the second router and change the LAN IP address (let's say from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.2), clear the DHCP checkbox, and hit apply, I get a message telling me to manually reset the IP address of my computer, and the router kicks me off. I can't log back on and have to reset to factory default. There's nothing about this in the instructions. Am I doing something wrong??  
I'm connecting to the internet through a Netgear router, model WNDR3400v2.  It's located in the first floor of my three-floor row house, and the signal does not quite reach to the study, which is in the opposite corner of the house on the third floor. I have another Netgear router, model WNDR3300.  I think I should be able to set this up to relay the signal so that I get good coverage all over the house.  My first question is, must the second router be physically connected to the first (by ethernet cable)? Or is there a way I can do this wirelessly?
