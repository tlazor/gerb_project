you have not mentioned what your HOST os is.  I have a system that has a pair of those intels and when I started dualbooting between windows and linux, Win got finiky about holding the network interface up.  I never 1ce had an issue with linux makeing or holding a network connection.  I often transfer 50+gb at a time and it didn't even flintch.  Windows on the other hand would randomly not get on the network. its possible there is a bug with either the driver or the nic that it isnt playing nice.   
I'd also note we haven't actually trouble shot the network properly - can you ping google and 8.8.8.8? What would traceroute look like? Does switching to another mirror help? i've found that my local mirror is horrid and end up using the UK or US mirrors instead.
There's another option - bypass virtualbox's networking completely and using a dedicated USB wireless adaptor you pass through to the host.
If the server must be visible to the router and receive its own IP address, you want a bridged network connection instead of NAT. Select "Bridged Adapter" under "Attached to:" and select your wireless network card under "Name:"
A bridged connection creates a direct connection to the router instead of a translated connection through the host machine.
Since you had this error  how is the machine getting dns? ping www.google.com before you get an issue like the error message above and ensure that dns is properly responding. If you havent set a static ip the above bridge suggestion is the way I would go in that respect.
