The GPU chip makers (NVIDIA and ATI -now AMD) have been working for a long time on specialized hardware for running games, therefore they have been able to put a lot of research and development into making cards that can run very intensive games at a very high resolutions at a reliable frame rate.
Newer CPUs have placed the memory controller on the CPU itself. This has allowed Intel to jump into the integrated game by releasing 'decent' GPUs integrated onto the CPU itself.
But what's needed in cool graphics are simple specific arithmetic Basically it's multiplying a matrix of 4 by 4 with another 4 by 4 matrix. Now do this for every pixels in the screen to decide what it's color is.
The same for CPU. CPU can multiply, can divide, can do integer arithmetic, have registers that jump from memory to memory. CPU can do so many things.
Now, tell the CEO to fold 1000 paper planes and you'll see that it doesn't work out. The CEO will complain but I have other skills. I can manage. I can summon managers. I can summon investments. I can hire 1000 cheap labors to make 1 million paper planes for you. What I cannot do is hand fold it my self.
As long as you have enough system memory you can get decent quality because you dont have to run the connections over different bus's (AGP, PCI-E). This is different then the old integrated method where the GPU was on the motherboard and shared system memory. Intel's new Iris graphics is a indication that 'integrated' GPUs are getting a more viable option for gaming. 
And why we use extra graphic cards for high quality graphics like NVIDIA, ATI intead of using onboard graphics...
