However, since the whole thing is going to be placed in an area of high ionizing radiation levels during the experiment, it must be remote controlled, for which the other, the available network port is to be used. And since I don't know the network settings at the facility the experiment is going to happen I cannot preconfigure it.
Which means, I want to protect the "mission critical" NIC from having its settings altered, while the regular NIC should be user configurable.
The DAQ equipment communicates with the computer over ethernet. I've built both computer and DAQ equipment into a single case; I also did a HW modification on the NIC connecting the DAQ stuff to the computer, so that the connection is fully contained in that system. It is this NIC, that must have under no circumstances its settings changed, otherwise the whole system will cease to work.
I've configured a Windows-7 Professional machine with a particular data acquisiation program for a experiment, that will be carried out by a different group at a remote location.
