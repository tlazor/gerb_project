Arguably, you're trying to use a revision control system to do configuration management. Those are two very different kinds of activities. I think the approach you're taking won't scale well at all, and will lead to significant amounts of frustration. You would be better served to find decide upon a configuration management solution (there's quite a few well matured options out there: cfengine, puppet, chef, etc), and then have your configuration management solution pull its recipes and/or configuration files from the revision control system. It will give you the same net effect that you seem to be looking for, but will have the right tools working on the appropriate parts of the problem.
You could try ansible. It does not need a different server. You could even have the main repository on one or more of your systems and run ansible from each of them. And you could keep all the files in the configuration directories in sync even if the content has to differ (e.g. /etc/hostname, /etc/mailname, ...)
