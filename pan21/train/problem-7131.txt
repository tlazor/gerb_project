*The one difference is that the network interface can be down (or completely removed for that matter), but the loopback IP will always respond as long as the OS is running.
Tim, you are trying very hard to map abstract concepts to real life hardware and software.  They don't map exactly, so you always will have things that don't fit. Software is modularized for ease of coding and troubleshooting, but the divisions between modules don't line up with the concept of network layers. When we talk about software (or hardware) operating at this layer or that layer, we are abstracting their functions.  Which piece of code might actually be doing the work is dependent on the particular implementation. It may be based more on the hardware functions, like a device driver. There is no "device driver layer" in the OSI or TCPIP model.  
If you ping the loopback address (127.0.0.1) or the network interface address, the practical result is the same.  It may be that different parts of the operating system software are being used, but that is transparent to you*.
