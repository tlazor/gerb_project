Operating systems are designed around the assumption that there is no cost associated with using memory that is available. They make no effort to free memory because the assumption is that you'd rather have the memory be used than free. Most of the time, this assumption is correct.
So that my site will support less only few custom at same time, else the VDS provider will punish a over memory used ... I also read some article from google, some guy only rent a 256MB VPS, buy do a good job. So how to Optimization in my situation?
I would suggest you limit the system to the amount of memory you want to it to use. Avoid "burstable" or "overcommitted" memory setups. Give the operating system the amount of memory you actually want it to use, and expect it to use all of it.
I am new one for rent a server. I choose a CentOS VDS width 2G memory. After apache+mysql+php install and setting, My server cost 750MB and 1297MB free (I use free -m to see it)
And then I run one page of mine (2 mysql fulltext union search, 4 jquery ajax process, 4 social plungin, one whether online api, header footer use php include), then use SSH free -m, I see the memory will increase into 835MB, one page cost 85MB memory...
