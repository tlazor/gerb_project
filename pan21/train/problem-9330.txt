I currently have three WordPress sites hosted on Apache with virtual host files to direct the right domain to the right DocumentRoot. Ghost (node.js) just came out and I've wanted to tinker with it and just play around on one of my spare domains. I'm not really interested in moving over to nginx so I'm trying to get Ghost working on Apache via mod_proxy. I've managed to get Ghost working on my spare domain, but I think there's a problem with my virtual host files, as all of my other domains start pointing to Ghost as well. Here are two virtual host files, one for my main WordPress site that works fine, and the second for Ghost. Domains removed and replaced with DOMAIN and DOMAIN2.
As a result, any virtual host in a <VirtualHost *:80> block gets completely ignored for any requests coming in on the IP address you defined in your <VirtualHost IP:80> block, and it serves all requests.
You fix this by consistently using either name-based or IP-based virtual hosting for all virtual hosts on a given IP address.
You tried to mix name-based and IP-based virtual hosting on an IP address. This almost never has the results you expect.
I get the feeling I'm not working with virtual hosts or mod_proxy right, and Google-fu has let me down after many suggested attempts. Any ideas? Thanks!
