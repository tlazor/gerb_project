I am not completely sure what your main goal is here, but I am trying to give you some suggestions that you could work on.
Furthermore, the enemy on left is exhibiting a strange behavior, why does it stop and do nothing when the player has stopped? Shouldn't it attempt to damage the player before he continues moving forward?
Your question immediately made me think of Pacman -- here you have the ghosts, each kinda doing its own thing.  Words from the PacMan guy himself confirmed it:
Also, you say that you don't want the enemies to overlap, but in that image above, they kind of do, have you tried giving them a little more visible distance between each other? After that you could try implementing handlers for overlapping, i.e., whenever an instance of an enemy is about to run into another instance, it should either have a small wait time before continuing moving or perform an altogether different behavior, such as walking backwards.
How about you try changing the speed of individual enemies? For example, the one closest starts running towards the player and attempting to hit him, while the 2nd enemy continues walking at the same speed it did before.
