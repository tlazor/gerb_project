Dell and other companies who ship fully built computers generally don't provide the parts to easily add extra drives yourself (as in this case you are missing the drive 'rails' they use to easily insert a drive and this is why your kit doesn't 'fit').
However SSD's are very versatile and so you can mount them in a number of 'non-traditional' ways. In a case where you're sure it won't accidently get moved, you can simply lie the SSD in the correct place and leave it there, as they are so light the cables will hold it in the correct positon unless you've moved the PC or something (and in which case you should be checking everything inside anyway).
You can mount it where ever you'd like as long as the cables fit, but in my experience the cables from cases such as this will only just fit to the 'normal' location, not giving you much choice. Just make sure not to block any air vents.
Also you can use double sided sticky tape, or velco backed tape to more securely attach it in a particular area.
