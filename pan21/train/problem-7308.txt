You can also use any other Domain User's name & password as an alternate of Administrator & Password.
I know the password works, as the same domain administrator password was used to add the computer to the domain successfully. I've tried multiple domain accounts unsuccessfully and was able to manually add a domain user account under manage users via the local admin. I was not able to add the domain\Administrator because it says there is already an account. I even tried going through the Network ID wizard which accepted the domain admin account and password however it still won't log in.
No real errors under event log but noticed some Time service issues because it was set to manual. Setting to auto start didn't help anything.
First of all make sure you have provide an accurate name for system means doesn't conflict with other computer in the network & than try.
Go to TCP/IP Properties & add DNS Server address as well as global DNS Server adress manually & try once again to  configure the system as a member of domain.
This computer is running Win10 and my DCs are Server 2012 r2. After adding this particular computer to the domain it will not accept any domain user password. It simply says "The user name or password is incorrect. Try again".
You open server active directory service.there are all domain pc user show in ad then you reset password perticulor user which you use on that pc. password change next logon option check mark.
It is showing under Domain Computers in AD and the DNS server shows forward and reverse lookups for it. However it is not showing up under DHCP leases even thought it's getting an IP.
It is the only computer with this problem. I have added other computers to the domain recently, before and after. I even wiped and re-installed Windows 10 but the login issue remains.
if you can't able to login after that than you have need to reserve IP address for this system in the function of DHCP server.
