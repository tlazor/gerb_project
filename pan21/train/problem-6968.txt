Finally, the best you can do other than fromatting is to install a good registry cleaner, and clean the registry. If it's good it will find the loose stuff and fix it for you. 
First of all, try to reinstall the program and uninstall it. The uninstallation problem may end with this.
If uninstallation is completely impossible then open your Task Manager -> Go to Start-Up -> Select this particular application from the list and Disable it. It won't load any more during the start-up.
If you're still having a problem, I would recommend using Revo Uninstaller.  If you use it, be careful, as with any tool of this type, it can cause more problems if not used correctly.  I've had success using it in situations you describe.
If you haven't used a piece of software like that, you can try to to install alternative add/remove software, and try to uninstall it from there. But rarely this works.
If you want to remove this application from your disk, do this. Stop all the services of this particular application in Task Manger. Then go to the location where this application is installed and delete the folder of this application that was created during installation. Sometimes you may not be able to delete all files. In that case, restart your system and try to delete once again after stopping all services, if any is running.(This is not a good way to remove the application)
If you can't uninstall it from Control Panel, there are many softwares to uninstall applications like IOBit Uninstaller, C Cleaner, Advanced Uninstaller. Try any of these and you may be able to uninstall.
There is no absolute way to uninstall software, unless you used installation monitoring software to install it. This is a piece of software that records whatever is changed by the installation and can revert it.
