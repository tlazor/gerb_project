I'm not sure how better to phrase the question, so I'll try to be clearer in the question. We've got Outlook 2003, 2007, and 2010 all being run.
In a SharePoint application we run, emails are sent from an address of sharepoint@company.com. Based on which of several sites it came from, the code would alias the email address in the format PROJECT NUMBER - PROJECT NAME. This way, even though the emails came from the same address, users could set rules in Outlook to filter specific project reminders into specific folders.
However, an update to the email filter a couple months ago blocked off all outgoing email from this address, because it was not a recognized email address from Active Directory. We fixed this by creating an AD entity named "SharePoint" that used that email address, which satisfied the filter.
Is there a setting or other method that can be used to override Outlook's overriding the specified name for the email address? Is it specific to any version of Outlook? Or is there something that can be done in Exchange Server or Active Directory to amend this issue?
This has had the unfortunate side effect that all of our internal users have "SharePoint" as their contact. As such, while my code definitively and repeatedly asserts that the email is coming from PROJECT NUMBER - PROJECT NAME, and while our clients and other external emails will see it coming from the same, all of our internal users get it from SharePoint regardless of the source. And they're not very happy about that.
