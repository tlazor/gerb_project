That's my development server, though, which is under some load.  I'd expect higher numbers if the array was idle, like I suspect yours is.  
If the server has battery backup you can enable basic drive caching on the Logical Volumes without risk.
Enable cache directly from the firmware. YOU MUST be running on a battery backup or if power goes out you could be hosed by enabling the cache. Below is a tutorial explaining the full process to do so.
I have 4 1TB Western Digital Enterprise 7200 RPM drives on a 3Ware 95500-SX and my hdparm results are

Just for some perspective, I don't exactly know if your buffered reads are "slow" but I put mine up for comparison.
The long answer: The H200 is the old SAS 6iR with SATA 6Gb/s support. It doesn't have the usual features you'd see on a RAID card (battery backup unit, onboard caching, RAID5/6 support). The cache determines how fast your RAID array is (along w/ the # of spindles and type of drive), so no cache = slow performance. Add the 7200RPM SATA drives (which are slow compared to a 10-15k RPM SAS drive) and that's the level of performance you can expect.
