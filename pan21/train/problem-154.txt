So i'm trying to use the find command to find all files in my system with mtime -x. It does this but it does not "find" the directories of the file. 
This will find all files (-type f) in the current path (.) that have been modified within the last two days (-mtime -2) and for each of them: execute (-exec) rsync, copying the file with the given name ({}) to /destination/, preserving most attributes (-a), giving verbose output (-v) and reproducing the whole path at the destination (-R).
Second, find called as above will not only report files, but also directories. When a directory name is given to rsync as a source, it will synchronize that whole directory to the destination. This can be prevented using  the additional test -type f ("type must be file") for find. Be aware, though, that this will not only exclude directories, but also sockets, named pipes, block and char devices, and symlinks. For symlinks, you could use the -xtype parameter instead, which will check the type of the symlink target.
Which works a charm for bringing over the directory tree but when i try to pull the files into  it, they don't go into the separate directories, they just spill into the main directory i copied them into to.
Any ideas how i can get either the find command to find the directories too or another way around this problem?
First, when giving (single) file names to rsync and not simply a directory, it must be told explicitly to use the whole path and not only the filename for the destination. For this, use the option -R. From the manual page to rsync(1):
The manpage then continues on how to manipulate the path so that only parts of it will be present on the receiving side, but that is out of scope here.
I thought if i could bring over all the directories that it would feed into them if it could so i tried:
