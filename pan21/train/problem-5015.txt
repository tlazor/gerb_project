It rather depends on what your goals and resources are as to what is better for your environment. What is very important is maintaining a single source-of-truth for the zone. This is more difficult when running BIND in front of ADI zones due to how the various AD boxes keep their SOA records and serial numbers but if you're only running one ADC, then it's not even a concern. 
With forwarding, you configure your BIND server to forward requests to the AD boxes, allowing you to point your clients at the BIND boxes so they can do the fetching and caching for non-AD requests, but this does very little to offload any of the client load from the AD boxes.
With delegation, you configure BIND as a slave to the AD server, offloading the query load to the BIND server. As long as AD is still the SOA (ala ADI), then any dynamic updates will still be sent to the AD box. You can still configure other zones on the BIND server, however you can run into some issues with multiple views that I've sorted out in the past by adding conditional forwarders to the AD boxes.
