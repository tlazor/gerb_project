This is a combination of  exiftool FAQs #2 & #3.  You are trying to write "Date" but that isn't the actual name of the tag that Windows reads.  Additionally, Photoshop Elements may be reading yet a different tag.  And to add on to all that, I believe that Windows and Photoshop Elements will read the time stamps differently.
The above command will write the Quicktime:CreateDate value exactly as written.  If you want to write the value according to the spec (adjusted to UTC), you can add -api QuickTimeUTC to the command and exiftool will adjust the time to UTC based upon the local computer's time setting, or if you include the time zone in the value written, e.g. -Quicktime:CreateDate="2019:07:22 12:00:00-05:00", then exiftool will use that to adjust to UTC.  In that example, exiftool will end up setting the time to 2019:07:22 17:00:00.  Windows will then read it as 2019:07:22 12:00:00 (assuming your time zone is EDT, -05:00) and Photoshop Elements will read it as 2019:07:22 17:00:00.
Here's is where you run in to the second problem. According to the spec, the Quicktime:CreateDate tag is supposed to be in UTC.  Windows understands this and displays the time correctly adjusted to the local time zone.  From what I understand, Adobe programs do not read it properly and assume that the time is local time, not UTC.  So if the timestamp is written according to the spec, Photoshop Elements will probably not show the proper time.
exiftool -FileCreateDate="2019:07:22 12:00:00" -FileModifyDate="2019:07:22 12:00:00" -Quicktime:CreateDate="2019:07:22 12:00:00" FILE.mp4 
I believe the three tags you mostly likely want to try to alter are the FileModifyDate, FileCreateDate (both System tags, meaning they're a part of the underlying file system) and the Quicktime:CreateDate tags.  To change these you would use this command:
That will give you the actual tag names instead of tag descriptions.  It will also show duplicate tags and what groups they belong to.
