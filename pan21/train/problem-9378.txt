Another suggestion...  Do you need actual content filtering or would site based filtering be enough?  I find that in a lot of scenarios OpenDNS works well.  If you have a static IP address it's trivial to setup and requires very little maintenance.
As far as I know, the software literally filters all incoming and outgoing internet activity over HTTP. My theory is that if I use this computer as a sort of internet-proxy machine sitting between my modem and router, I will effectively be able to filter everything on my network. 
Here's the deal. There's a great internet content filter available, but it only runs on Windows and Mac, and my entire network is run on Linux, from my Android phones to my Ubuntu laptops and desktops, to my Google TV unit. I'd like to filter all of these devices' internet access via this software, but can't natively install it on each device. Thus, I figured I do it on a network-level.
Not a direct answer, but if you want to stay in the *nix world you might install Untangle on that hardware you're thinking about putting XP on. The free version is a pretty solid UTM.
What would I need hardware-wise to make this happen? I'd need an ethernet in and and ethernet out, but is there anything else I'm overlooking? 
I'd also suggest looking at Endian.  In my experience the configuration is easier and the web gui is lighter than Untangle.  Having said that Untangle works very well.  What do you currently have for a router on your network?  Some routers can be setup to forward web traffic to a proxy server.
