We have a Jira server that uses a personal certificate for authentication followed by a standard user/password authentication. This personal certificate is typically installed the Windows certificate store, for example. A typical scenario is when opening the Jira website, the user is prompted to choose a certificate to authenticate with. Once authenticated, the user is then prompted for a username and password.
I've gotten to the point of creating a reverse proxy using Apache, but I can't seem to get the right configuration so that Apache passes the personal certificate to the Jira server when it connects to it.
The problem for me comes in when interfacing to the Jira server from our Jenkins instance. The plugin that I am using to connect to the Jira server does not support the personal certificate authentication scheme. Someone gave me an idea to use a reverse proxy to authenticate with the Jira server configured with the personal certificate of the service account that I am using to connect with the Jira server.
