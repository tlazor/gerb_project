To be sure that the files are the same you can run a MD5 comparator on both files, before restarting the mysql service. After the comparison, restart the service and check if file's last modification time is updated.
On Windows with MyISAM table (I assume there are no InnoDB tables) you have following backup options:
The safer bet is to stop mysql and copy the entire directory - in other words, what you are already doing.
This copying occurs immediately after updating the tables. Do I need to issue a FLUSH TABLES or something like that before switching off the MySQL instance and copying the files?
You cannot simply copy MySQL file to take a backup. It will be inconsistent and most likely corrupt.
What I noticed lately is, though, that in the backup folders, the individual files (or most of them) - .MYD, .MYI, etc. have a different (older) modified date/time than the files in the actual MySQL data folder. It's like the files were copied WITHOUT the changes just made. I am using the following code in a .bat file to copy the data files:
I update these databases once a week. (I disable my web site in the process - but this is OK for me). I then switch off the MySQL server instance, and copy over the physical folders to another backup folder (datestamped - eg: CB1_17_03_2016) on the same server.
I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine and on it I have 2 MySQL MyISAM databases. These databases are quite large as they are over 20GB in combined size.
What you want to do is called a physical backup, in the sense you are copying the raw database files.
You see an older modification time on your backup probably because when you restart the mysql service, the table files are touched, and their last modification time is updated.
