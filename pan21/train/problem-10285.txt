The simplest for our purpose is 'Firefox mobile OS Simulator'. It runs as add-on for Firefox browser, this lightweight simulator has an ActiveSync Client built in for emails.
Actually there is a way to have lightweight desktop client with ActiveSync.. its a workaround. you will need a modern mobileOS simulator to achieve this.
A quick thing that may work is just to set up a rule on Outlook (if you use it) or through OWA that will forward all your emails to the external Gmail account. 
You can use Outlook with ActiveSync - you add an account as Exchange Active Sync (from Control Panel, Outlook not running) , when you get "Log onto Exchange Active Sync mail server (EAS): The server cannot be found" - kill the host process from Task Manager - start Outlook and you will find ActiveSync access in Outlook. 
Anyway, Sorry I cannot really think of a proper easy solution, I cannot find an PC Activesync addons - Other than downloading a Pocket PC Emulator!. 
Evolution will do this, and there is a Thunderbird plugin.  Also, there exist some OWA->IMAP bridges out there.
Another thing may be to beg your administrator (or bribe with Pizza!) to enable POP3 or RPc over HTTP, even if it is just for your IP.
... You just got me thinking, Why doesn't Outlook support Activesync! I guess it would just be a redundant feature for Microsoft to support when RPC is so much more feature rich and complete...
