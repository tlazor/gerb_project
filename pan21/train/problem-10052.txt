I'm not a big fan of periodic maintenance. I think you should be monitoring your servers on a continuous basis and responding to problems immediately. I use home brewed monitoring (just some VBScripts using WMI) but there are lots of server monitoring apps out there. The things I look for on a daily basis are:
It's a bit more involved than that, for example there are some non-error eventlog entries I check for, e.g. the Eventlog entry indicating a restart. Also I linear regress the free disk space to warn me if the disk space will fall to zero in the next six months.
I'm looking at creating a schedule and list of periodic maintenance for our Windows servers (2k3, 2k8).  Any thoughts, suggestions or ideas of things that should be implemented.  Bonus points for Citrix tasks that should be done.
Maintenance would include periodic security patch installation (after proper testing in TEST environment), hardware level scrubbing (not all servers are placed in super cool data centers), and review of capacity reports (parts replacements, capacity upgrades). Going through Annual Maintenance Contracts to verify validity and need of renewal.
Pretty much everything that reoccurs periodical is automated, except for physical cleaning the insides of the machines. It is amazing that even in suppose sterile data centers the fan still clocks up with all kinds of crud. 
Server Maintenance is luxury :), I mean people should get enough time from reacting to issues. Just kidding.
