QA. For a project this size QA is definitely worth mentioning, since this is the size of project where it's going to make a very large difference. Also I, personally, would probably break Game-play Design up into several jobs. You are definitely right that it is certainly a big one, but it's definitely large enough that you're going to want separate people doing combat and systems and story scripting, things like that. 
Some stuff off the top of my head. Note that in real game development with large teams, people will often cross roles, so that more than one person does a task and a person does more than one task.
I would split "server engine design" into several chunks. The person who designs the back-end data models is probably not the person who focuses on managing the massive data replication and distribution issues with real-time MMOs.
I would really appreciate it if there aren't any answers like "Making MMOs is too expensive", "Don't even try making an MMO!" etc.
Like Aerathis said, Gameplay Design needs to be split up. Your User Experience person will not be your story writer will not be your low-level gameplay designer will not be your economist (and so on for the mapper, the person who designs and balances classes, and so on).
Management. Someone needs to coordinate between the different groups and make sure they are able to do their jobs.
Graphics programming. Distinct from programming the core features of the client application and drawing/modelling the art. Someone needs to develop shaders and special graphical techniques.
