2) If you have incorrectly specified DNS on the server, or, you had additional local aliases on the previous machine, a DNS timeout could take 30 seconds. For example if you were calling something 'machine2' and machine2 was aliased in /etc/hosts on the old machine but not in normal DNS (ie available through resolv.conf).
Dedicated machine? From ebay? This is REALLY low for a modern machine that is supposed to last 4-5 years and was just bought. A consumer board can pull in 16gb or RAM these days.
Drupal shouldn't need a load into memory, and you're right that this doesn't look like a memory-bound problem. It would be very interesting to see (a) some CPU load numbers while you're getting a slow page load and (b) a little more about your software stack. 
Once you've looked at the Apache configuration, MySQL config. (Nick O'Neil wisely suggested looking in to network latency if your database isn't on the same host as your Drupal.) I found this blog post helpful in database tuning for a site recently.
If this site was running normally on another server, and, we've identified you're not under heavy load. I'd suggest this is more likely to be DNS or firewall related; are you making any remote calls to another system to pull in feeds etc.
is everything on the same server including the database for your drupal cms site too ? if the database is somewhere else that might be the culprit which is having problems.
I assume you're using Apache and MySQL; how were they installed? Did you do any tuning of their default configurations? Look at the Apache configuration first; the MPM configuration is a place where some "off" numbers can really slow you down. It would be good to see how the <IfModule mpm_prefork_module> block is configured, for example.
