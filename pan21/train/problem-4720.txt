Most IP Cameras encode video and stream using web service. RaspberryPI constraints are its cpu's ability to receive, decode and display a particular video in real-time. Consider looking up camera encoding specifications to determine video compression (H.264 or MJPEG) and application layer transport protocol (i.e. HTTP and RTSP) and matching that with the Pi's decoding capabilities. Please post solution. I have similar needs also. :)
It is almost guaranteed if you can find the streaming address of the IP camera. You can use Kodi to handle the stream receiving. OpenELEC, LibreELEC and OSMC are three examples of Kodi-centric distributions for Raspberry Pi.
Just keep in mind that the Pi 1 may have trouble decoding anything other than H.264 (plus VC-1 and MPEG-2 if you bought the CODECs) at 1080p, as the above three formats are decoded using the GPU, and the CPU may have trouble keeping up with the task alone.
By the way, Raspberry Pi themselves makes excellent IP cameras too, using its camera module to capture the action. You may even run some OpenCV on it to identify and help capture critical moments of a crime scene.
It's pretty good and you can turn your raspi into a cam recorder. You can set it to record videos when it detects motion, you can be warned by mail if motion is detected etc. or you can just view your cam on your tv like you wanted. 
Actually you can and it's working pretty good. I own an ip camera with a raspi 2 also and i'm using this motioneyeos.
