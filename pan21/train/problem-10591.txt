Actually if your fiber is good and your splices / terminations are good, you very well may make 750 meters with 1000baseLX transceivers.  
With mode conditioning patch cords, 1000BaseLX has a specified distance limit of 550m.  This distance is based on loss, not timing, with worst-case fiber quality / loss.  If your fiber is better than worst-case, you can go longer distances.  In practical use it's not common to go much, much further than the 550m distance minimum.  Cisco will even support distances beyond 550m under certain conditions with testing.  
You'll want to make sure your connections are all clean, terminations are all order, patch cords are of the best quality and in the best possible condition to have the best possible chance of success.  
I ran tests and got serious fluctuations. Speed ranging from 200 to 400 Mbps. Not consistant at all. Ran single mode over MM using patch leads. This is greater than is required for now so hopefully will. Had a chat with client that future budgets need to consider an upgrade to the link.
If you have a meter that can test at 1300nm or 1310nm, use the best strands you have available rather than the next two unused strands in the patch panel.
