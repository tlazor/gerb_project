If the first packet on link-up was received on what had initially assumed and set to be the Transmit line then the TX/RX functions would be swapped over, and subsequent order was restored. 
Routers and switches now are smart enough to not require one or the other. Only when going from pc -> hub or pc -> pc is one or the other required.
As to why they were required, and this is just what I remember, the computers transmit on 2 pairs and receive on 2 pairs, so in order to prevent collisions, you had to switch 2 of the pairs to connect two machines directly.
Of course we still need cross-over cables for directly linking most network devices without using switches or hubs, otherwise the two transmit ports would be connected together, as would the receive ports. The cross-over cable correctly connects transmitter to receiver.
The next step was to provide a switch on the hubs so that you could use either straight or cross-over cables for chaining. These days it's all done with intelligent chips.
Even when the early auto-sense Ethernet PHY transceivers became available I think a good proportion of the cheaper ones were not "seemless".
The drawback in some devices was that although the first packet sensed on TX would trigger the switch, it was otherwise "unreadable" as far as its packet contents were concerned and so would be dropped. Transceivers like this did rely on retransmission in the upper layers, as the first Received packet after link-up would be dropped if there was an initial TX/RX mismatch.
The reason straight cables are used is because they are easier to manufacture, as both ends are the same. Cross-over cables were originally used when chaining hubs because they wanted the link port to be different to the other ports. You need to bear in mind that back then things could strange results, or even no results, if you didn't use the link ports as intended.
