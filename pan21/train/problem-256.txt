What you may find are L-shaped brackets that a server may rest on, but those are not able to support the server while slid out. Depending on your application this may or may not be sufficient.
Is what you want achievable? Definitely, but it's impossible to give a more definitive answer without additional details.
In general, rack mounting rails for chassis are proprietary solutions. For this exact reason, pretty much any chassis you buy for any rack hardware will come with its own rails. In most cases, it's safe to assume that they are designed to carry the weight of the loaded chassis when extended, so question 1 is usually not a problem.
Long answer: This is going to vary a lot from one chassis/enclosure to the next or even from one sub-model of enclosure to the next.
Rail kits tend to be specific to the type of enclosure you're getting, since while the holes on the rack mounting post are standardized, the method of fastening rails to the case is not.
On the other hand, it's very difficult to resolve question 2. In many cases, for full length chassis, there will not be sufficient clearance to remove the top if there is equipment in the above position. You may even need to reserve 2U above for clearance for your hands to remove the top, and you may need to reserve additional space beyond that if you intend to actually work in the back of the chassis while it's mounted in the rack. In general, don't hope for too much without a lot of planning for a full-length chassis in the middle position of a loaded rack.
If you don't have anything above it, then several of the SuperMicro chassis, such as the SC846 series have some sub-models that have removable tops that you can remove while they're in the rack. Even here, you have to be cautious, because some of the sub-models in "proper installation" have the top screwed down on the chassis. They all come with their own rails and extend pretty far.
