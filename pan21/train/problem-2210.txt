"best" tool is very subjective.  Cacti & Nagios are both fine tools, each serving a different purpose (Cacti provides trending data, while Nagios provides real-time monitoring/alerting).
I'm currently using InterMapper (commercial software, but reasonably-priced IMO), which does a little of both (though it's much stronger on the monitoring side than trending) - It wins on ease of use & flexibility in monitoring some of the more esoteric bits of my environment.
I prefer Cacti. It works perfectly. If you need a realtime monitoring http://osman.gen.tr/server-info this tool works good on Linux platforms
Another good monitoring application i have been using for a couple of years is xymon (formally known as hobbit) this is another good system, you have a web UI for snoozing monitoring but you have to configure everything though files on the server.
it depends what sort of thing you are after for monitoring, i have been playing with groundworks at the moment (uses nagios as the backend monitoring system) but has all bee wrapped up in a web UI to make administration easier for people.
I would say to stay with cacti and nagios at the moment but if you find that you are looking more into needing collect data for trending purposes it might be worth taking a peak at groundworks (there is a pay for version and a community edition) if you have experience with nagios you should be able to pick things up quiet quickly.
