The current set-up is Mariadb (mariadb Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.1.38-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu), InnoDB (I turned on innodb_file_per_table as we had some 200+GB ibdata1 files.). We use parallel (conservative) replication.
Any help or suggestions would be really appreciated as I am kind of thrown in the deep-end here, I am not a DBA but whilst we do not currently have one I am the "best fit" and we need to get these servers replicated correctly for production. 
I have noticed that sometimes our servers drift but this usually corrects itself as I am assuming a large statement(s), one of the reasons I turned on Logging. But some servers will just not correct themselves and one of these only has a 2.6G ibdata1 file, I have restarted slave a few times but its just very slow. I am good on the Linux and Hardware side and ensured there is no other problems with disks. The network link between the servers via web, each server has 1Gbps Connection though and we see no latency ~6ms ping and stable. Some servers drift when there is no load on the servers, like the slave is not requesting from the master and it certainly doesn't seem to use full bandwidth. Overnight one of our servers has gone from being synced to 3 hours behind and seems to be increasing. I cannot see any issue on other database or even any users logged in to our application. could something be locking it from replicating?
If anyone also has any suggestions on learning resources, I think maybe this setup needs to be started from scratch, we do not use GTID for example, I wonder if we even use the correct replication method.
