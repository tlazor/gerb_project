That option disables some Domino users's ability to request return receipts from non-Domino users.  (But it's really not that effective, because it only works for users who are set up to generate their messages using Notes/Domino's internal rich text format.  Users who are set up to generate their messages in MIME format don't require this conversion, so their return receipt requests will go through.)
Blocking return receipts in Notes/Domino can be done on the client side by hex-editing the nnotesws.dll file and changing the ReturnReceipt string to something else.
I'm fairly new to Domino administration. I have a problem regarding return receipts on our Domino 9 server. I've been asked to disable all return receipts from our server. I've found the place where it's disabled:
I'm unsure whether this should be posted here or on StackOverflow, so I apologize in advance if this is the wrong site.
After this I have retarted the server, but we still send out return receipts when getting mails. I have tested from an Outlook 2013 client. Is this how it is or am I missing something?
