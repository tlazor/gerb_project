Is it a good idea to just shut the cluster down, and if so, what's the best way to take all the brokers offline? 
The cluster was left up for the network outage. All kafka clients were shutdown so the cluster was quiet prior to the outage. Outage was about 3 minutes. Upon coming back online, the cluster was allowed to reconverge and it seems to have done just that. A preferred leader election was requested and all brokers/all topics returned to a good state. Once stable, the kafka clients were brought back online and everything worked. 
We have a kafka cluster. And a network. Yay. The network will be unavailable across all racks in our data center for 5-10 minutes (!) because maintenance requires it. I'm concerned that is too long an outage for kafka to handle gracefully and that it might start getting so confused about its state that it will not recover once the network is back online.
So.. for this situation, the right thing to do is quiet the kafka cluster, but don't bring down any of the brokers; let it ride -- it will recover. Of course, this assumes you can accommodate the data loss during the outage. 
It's a kafka 0.10.0 cluster running on 6 nodes distributed in different racks around the data center.
