I don't think desktop versions of Outlook typically support ActiveSync.  Microsoft may have added a special exception for Hotmail.
Gmail supports Exchange ActiveSync on mobile devices only. POP and IMAP are the options with Outlook. Not sure if there are any plans to change this. 
ActiveSync is supported in 2013, however GMail requires SSL and the Outlook2013 dialog for ActiveSync setup does NOT allow this.  So, you will get Server errors when setting up your account.  Perhaps there will be an update soon that will give the added functionality.  Of course you could use IMAP, but as you probably know GMail IMAP support is pretty horrendous (slow, and prone to freezing).
I think this is an issue with how Outlook 2013 is negotiation authentication with the exchange server using active sync. I have tried this on Office365 with an EAS-only-enabled account and got Outlook 2013 to the point of at least finding the server and attempting authentication, alas it seems to fail. I got this far by specifying SSL in the proxy settings. Note that Basic Authentication fails when it attempts to connect to the server but Negotiated seems to find the server but fail to authenticate properly and repeatedly asks for a password. Hopefully this all gets panned out.
