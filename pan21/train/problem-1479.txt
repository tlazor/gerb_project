Finally, don't forget that you are making a game, no one will care how you did it as long as the result seem good, no object needs more than a buoyancy force and some soft speed cap to simulate friction. If I were making the game I would probably not bother with calculating buoyancy, I'd just type in a number and see if the resulting simulation behave to my satisfaction.
Also, you are mixing 2D and 3D, so your units don't match, you have a 3-dimensional density, so you need to multiply that by a 3-dimensional volume, in other words factor in a depth for any object or all your real world units will be for nothing.
Try pushing a beach-ball either a half or a whole metre under water and let go, you'd think the whole metre would give double the jump height, but the difference is almost non-existent, that is because the beach ball have almost reached terminal velocity in less than half a metre, most of the energy you spent pushing it down is lost to friction before the ball hit the surface.
You probably missed friction, in water that is a velocity dependent force working in the opposite direction of the velocity. For light voluminous objects the friction will counteract buoyancy very quickly.
