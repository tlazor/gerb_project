in either cygwin environment inside windows or a linux virtual machine inside windows with windows drives mounted (e.g. with virtualbox)  
... or you can just make a zip archive (with compression method set to just "Store"), and then unpack the files where you wanted to copy them.
My own issue was that files have the correct time but directories did not. rsync has sorted out the dates on the directories as well as the dates on the files. 
RoboCopy can preserve the mtime for directories with the /DCOPY:T switch, but this only works in Vista and newer.  It can also preserve ACLs.  Alternatively, FastCopy can be configured to preserve directory mtimes, ACLs, and ADSes.
NB cygwin and virtualbox are both free and enable you to have to a lesser or greater extent linux functionality on windows - they both require a bit of setting up - particularly virtualbox, but have many benenfits....
RoboCopy should be able to do it with the COPYALL switch.  You can grab the GUI version from Microsoft Technet.
(this is really used as a syncing tool from one directory to another mirror and the timewindow option is to prevent issues when windows systems move clocks 1 hour for daylight savings etc. compared to linux systems)
