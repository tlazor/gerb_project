You can mix cards from multiple vendors, but I've found that things go a lot smoother when you stick with one type of chipset instead.  I had (resolvable) trouble a couple of times when mixing drivers for an ATI and nvidia card.
Assuming you're using Windows XP or Vista, you can use most any combination of video cards.  SLI is only necessary if you want multiple cards to combine efforts for rendering the same scene.
For example, I'm running two monitors off the dual DVI output from a GeForce 7800GTX and the third is running off a separate GeForce 8500GT.  Works great.
The Windows way has been covered well. I just wanted to point out that if you can't install another card, you can hook up your third monitor to another computer and use software to "join" the computers. I use Multiplicity from Stardock at work and it works great. It's not free but it's only about $30. It may be an option for you.
If you're not using the 3rd screen to play video games, you can give one of DisplayLink's USB to video adaptors a try. Just another option if you want to relay video over USB.
The matrox triplehead2go is the way to achieve this without extra video cards, especially if you are on a laptop.
