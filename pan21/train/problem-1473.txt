This does not appear to be a slowloris attack, at least not based on the log file you've posted (3 requests per second is not much, and they're erroring out, not being held open).
It may be something else though - Check your error log for more information on WHY the requests are failing.
A large number of simultaneous connections (and/or the error log showing that the connections timed out rather than erroring out for some other reason) would indicate that this is in fact a slowloris attack.
I find it useful to use a LogFormat including %D. That will tell you how many microseconds processing the request took. It won't tell you if the time was spent on server side processing or waiting for the client. But at least it will tell you which requests took a long time, and those are usually worth investigating.
As others have pointed out, we can't definitively rule out slowloris without more information (specifically, netstat output showing how many simultaneous connections your system has from the subject IP(s)).
