On the web page of the doctor, there is the picture from the web camera. The picture is updated every 60 seconds. If I use right-click on it and selecting "Show picture on new tab" there is the picture with a clean link, no dynamic stuff, just like http://page.com/image.jpg. Also the same link is inside the page source code.
But the problem is that the downloaded file is the same for about 10-11 following pictures. And then next 10-11 pictures are different then the previous batch, but all look alike. Etc ...
So I guess there could be some problem with cache on the server, I tried wget --no-cache and wget --cache=off ... but nothing helped ... 
our new town doctor put a web camera to his waiting room for people to see how much crowded it is. As my mom and grandparents go to this doctor, I wanted to download the files periodically and if they are captured there, I wanted to send the photo to them. Childish, I know, but I just have to feed my procrastination during exam period. :) Now, to my problem.
PS: Im not writing here the real link because Im afraid she wouldnt be very happy if there was some prankster trying to mess with her server by downloading the file every second or something like that ...
I have Ubuntu 14.04 32bit home server. I made a script (see lower) and added it to cron to run every minute ... it works fine, pictures are being created.
