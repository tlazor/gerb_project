When you move the mailboxes, Outlook clients connecting to Exchange1 will automatically be redirected to Exchange3. In order for this to work "seamlessly", the old server needs to still be up and running. It's generally best to leave the old server up for a week or two just to make sure that all the clients are moved like this aside from the few vacationers, etc.
On that workstation hold CTLR + right click the outlook try icon when connected and choose "Connection Status..." that should tell you what the client is connected to for what service. As Evan pointed out, the clients are likely connecting to a Public Folder Database on Exchange1. 
I wonder about public folder stores. Are your clients connecting to a public store on the Exchange1 machine? Each mailbox database has a default public folder store setting. Check out the setting on the mailbox database where you moved the mailboxes. 
Do you have the client access role installed on Exchange3, and did you make sure that SP2 was installed on Exchange 2007 first?
