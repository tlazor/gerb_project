MDT creates boot images that you can use in WDS to allow PXE network booting and multicasting for ease of deployments. Best of all, MDT is free.
There are many more videos, articles and walk-throughs to help you deploy Windows on the Deploy Windows 7 page of the Springboard Series on TechNet.
MDT also manages device drivers similar to how WDS does it, using PnP hardware calls to install the proper drivers during the deployment. When you get a new model of PC, you would download the drivers for it and import them into MDT. It can also use WSUS or Windows Update to apply the latest patches during the deployment.
The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) used with WDS would be the best way.  First, decide which type of image best fits your needs. This could be a thick, thin, or hybrid image. Please see the TechNet Magazine article â€˜Desktop Image Management: Build a Better Desktop Image. In certain situations, having a thin image and adding software during the deployment makes it easier to keep the image updated with the latest versions of the software that your employees use. With MDT, you add applications into MDT and select which ones (or groups) that you will install to the machine you are deploying to.
