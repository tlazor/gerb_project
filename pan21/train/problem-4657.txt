Baking graphics card worked for me.  Subject:  Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop circa 2007 with Geo Force 7300 graphics card separately attached to motherboard by Dell as OEM.  Graphics on monitor went bad to basically unreadable over last 6 months.  Got so bad system would not boot I assume because of the card issued.  Removed card from motherboard.  It has only circuit board components, no fans attached.  Baked card for 10 min at 400 degrees F in preheated convection over with CPU on card facing down and card elevated above aluminum pan so no direct contact with metal.  Let cool down, reinstalled and bingo started up like new with graphics like new. The surprising thing is that the faulty graphics card really screwed up the rest of the computer.  Couldn't even use a separate monitor.
Now spending less time on my MacBook Pro only because my old friend came back to life.  It will be the mule computer around here in a few weeks. 
Definitely sounds like a bad GPU.  Also be VERY careful about taking Nate's advice, as he said.  Baking can work but use it as an absolute last resort.
The strange artifacts you're seeing is definitely a bad GPU.  If you want to save some money, hit up eBay and start looking for that particular GPU with that laptop as your search term.  You may be able to find a spare part that's available to replace it.  If you're not too tech savvy, ask a friend to install it for you - it's a bit of a pain to do so on a laptop and it is definitely not as straightforward as installing a new GPU on a desktop.
