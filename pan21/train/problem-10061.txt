My old favorite is Ctrl-C, but not on text, on a dialog box.  Most of the time it will copy the entire dialog box as text, so you don't have to do Alt-PrtScn and save an image of the application (unless you need to).  It also makes it easier to search for solutions to the error message without having to retype the whole thing.  I think I discovered this by mistake one day and have used it ever since.
