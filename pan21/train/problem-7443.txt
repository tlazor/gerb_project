Out of Remote Desktop/Terminal Server License numbers. Remember Win2003/2008 license contains 2+1 admin connections. For more you have to license TS.  
Volume Shadow Copy, believe it or not.  If you have VSS snapshots, and there are either too many of them or they are taking too much space, RDP can drop you right out.  Sometimes restarting the VSS services will bring it back on, other times you'll need to enable and start telnet, go in, and get all vssadmin on it's ass.
I updated the video driver on the remote desktop host (not client), and after doing so, it allowed remote connections in.
What are the most common things that will cause a Windows Server 2003/2008 to stop responding to Remote Desktop connections, even though other services on the computer are running fine?
I had a desktop (WinXP) on which remote desktop failed to respond, sort of.  When I tried to connect to it, there was no timeout, and no other reaction.  I entered the IP address, hit ENTER, and it returned to the same screen asking me which remote desktop to connect to.  This mystified me until Google later helped me find the answer.
This won't be a common problem, but it was odd and difficult enough that I thought it was worth mentioning.
