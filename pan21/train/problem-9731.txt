This Settings\Advanced Settings\Downloads\DownloadsLocation option appears to work for every attached file except a PDF (at least on the Mac version of Chrome that I use). When an attachment is a PDF, no pop-up window asking where to save appears as it does for Word, Excel & various image files....it just automatically downloads. 
The main point here is that it is a Google Chrome setting, and not a GMail\Settings\Advanced Settings option. 
To save a PDF without downloading first, after changing the download location setting, right click on the PDF attachment icon in the email, click "Open Link in New Window," and then once the PDF is open in the new browser window, clicking the download icon will trigger the pop-up, giving you the option to "Save As."
In my organization's implementation of Chrome in the Windows environment, there is a settings\advanced settings within the GMail account that does not provide for this option.
Rather, by activating the "Customize and Control Google Chrome" menu option on the far right-hand side of the address bar, a "Settings" option exists.  Within this Settings option, there is an "Advanced Settings" option and within this, there is a Downloads section.  Within the Downloads section, there is an option to "Ask where to save each file before downloading".  Simply activate the toggle.  
It appears that the Chrome settings allow you to open an "Advanced" mode settings page. There, there is a section for handling downloads and where you can check the box telling it to ask the user before every download.
