If the request or post information has your ID or personal information or something like that embedded in it, then that kind of defeats the purpose too.
If the request has to get back to your computer somehow, there is definitely a trail that leads back to you. Just depends on how obscure it is to trace. Commercial anonymizers just promise to stonewall by purging logs and stripping data from the request (if you trust them), and networks like Tor obscure your request by bouncing it all over the place (more info on their website) to obscure it and make tracking extremely difficult.
If you run a proxy at home, it doesn't take a forensic expert to know that there's a very limited number of people that could be making web requests from that home network.
It depends on what you're trying to obscure and how it's configured. Proxies aren't meant to hide people; they're meant to cache data, and later they started scanning content to filter it or protect people on the inside from malware. Anonymous proxies act anonymously by promising to not give out or retain logs (you have to trust them on that) and anyone trying to trace where the request is coming from is stopped at that hop if the proxy strips data out of the request that is personally identifiable.
