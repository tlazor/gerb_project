Use ddrescue instead.  It starts reading the hard drive and will automatically skip around when it hits a problem, then go back and try to re-read those problem areas.  It's really amazing how well it does when compared to some of the recovery programs I used to use on windows.   You can also start and stop whenever you want, it saves a kind the progress state to a file.  You can control-c, etc, however you want.  There's also plenty of options for customizing the read like trying harder on certain areas.
I have had a recent experience with a drive that made a ticking noise too. You're right about the HDD failing. The read/right pin's air gap isn't acting write causing the pin to fall onto the drive and make a ticking noise. My HDD was able to stand this for about a week before I was able to send it back to Lenovo. I had no issues copying information off of the drive. If you have acted on the problem quickly enough you shouldn't have many issues. I would do it in 1GB chucks though. Good Luck at getting all of your data off.
