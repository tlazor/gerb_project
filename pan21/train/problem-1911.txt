TO check for updates, go to Control Panel, Security, Windows Update, then click "Check for updates."
Another way to force a true rescan for updates is to wipe the slate clean, by deleting all updates stored in %windir%\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download:
Wuauclt.exe is the AutoUpdate Client of Windows Update and is used to check for available updates (for the various versions of the MS Windows platform) from Microsoft Update.
Then go to Windows Update, and "Check for updates".  It may take an hour, because every updateable file on your system volume is checked (subsequent "Checks for updates" will be fast). This approach eliminates errors, botched updates, and yields a clean, up-to-date system, at least insofar as MS sees it.
I've found that if, as part of your fresh install on Windows 7, you upgraded IE or you haven't run IE yet and answered the introductory questions, that Windows Update will give you an error. I also haven't found a way to switch Windows Update to Microsoft Update without going through the GUI, so I manually fire up IE, get it initialized and then setup Windows Update through the GUI, so I can switch to Microsoft Update and avoid the initial error. Your mileage may vary.
