Windows 7 is pretty quick to install so that's a pretty full proof way of getting rid of junk. Plus next time you re-install, do all the updates and then create a backup image which you can restore whenever necessary.
If you often install and remove stuff, because you just want to try something out, System Restore is your friend (you can even give it some more gigabyte of space if you can spare, that is). Seriously, that thing really improved since XP. In Windows 7, I have installed a "Lion Theme", which I've seen in an article from Lifehacker. (I thought it's some good stuff, since Lifehacker featured it.)  
How about trying out gamebooster v3? It is a great application that enhances your computer for gaming etc. I use it myself. Here is there website: http://www.iobit.com/gamebooster.html
For cleaning? You can find so many applications and questions about this even on this site. Just check the search bar with the keywords.  
Instead of something good, my PC couldn't boot up. After a force-reset, it took about 40 minutes to get to my desktop, and my desktop freeze after a few additional minutes. Anyway, I fired up the USB (with the Win 7 installer), and went right to the recovery section. I was surprised, but it restored everything. Correctly. Not a single trace of that crapware, no hassle.  
What can you do if you didn't restore?  I know we are over with this stupid "monthly reinstall" thing, but I think you should really do a reinstall. Save your data, and go for it. (But do it the clever way. Save all your data, and write up what applications you used, had installed, and so on.) And next time, don't forget. There is a thing called, Virtualization, that might help. You can just put everything you want into a VMWare guest, and use snapshots. That way, your host OS is protected and safe. (Or VirtualPC, or VirtualBox.)
