On its end, the storage virtualization layer should make sure to replicate data for redundancy and use the capabilities of the physical devices for replication, snapshots and other.
Do you know any solution that could accomplish the requirements listed above? A bonus point would be to be able to use the resources from the VMWare infrastructure.
The idea is that whatever happens to the physical layer, I can replace the defective device in a transparent manner or attach new devices to the virtual layer so that more space is available.
I'd like to use the capabilities of two Dell EqualLogic SAN and a VMWare vSphere 6 installation to implement a storage virtualization solution.
It seems that VMWare's Virtual Volumes is what I'm looking for but I don't seem to be able to create a Virtual Volume/VMDK (a.k.a LUN) and allow a physical host to connect it via iSCSI.
Basically I'd like to put virtual SAN layer above my two physical SANs so that it can provide the same services as a usual SAN, this is for say, LUNs, iSCSI endpoint and more, NFS, CIFS shares, etc...
