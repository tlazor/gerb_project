On OS X, Mac App Store apps are sandboxed and can't install kexts or require administrator or root privileges. So it's possible that anti-malware or other security software sold through the Mac App Store might not have the capabilities of similar Mac software sold outside of the Mac App Store.
Smartphone OSes are different for some apps. App store apps are often required to run in a sandboxed (isolated, protected, restricted) environment where they can't mess with anything outside of their own sandbox. On some smartphone OSes, sideloaded apps might not have the same restrictions. Or if you "jailbreak" your OS to remove restrictions, you can run apps with very few restrictions. Sandboxed anti-malware or other security software would need special APIs ("hooks") to allow them to do things outside of their sandbox, like receiving notifications anytime any file anywhere in the filesystem changes, so it can be re-scanned for viruses.
On OS X, with system administrator access, you can install kernel extensions (kexts; for example, device drivers are typically kexts), which load and run as part of the kernel, with all the privileges of the kernel (which is everything). So Yes, on OS X, there's basically nothing that anti-malware or other security software can't do.
