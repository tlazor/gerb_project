Whenever an entity is being added to an entity controller (which is essentially just a bag of entities), I scan through it's components to figure out if I need to register additional entity processors (game systems). For instance, if I add an entity which has a SpriteComponent attached to it for the first time, the EntityController resolves the e.g. SpriteRenderSystem using a factory and a simple specification, which is then being registered within the controller.
Now I'd like to make it possible to figure out whether the component of an entity has changed. I was suggested in off-topic discussion elsewhere that I should use an eventing system to raise component change events in order to have the entity rescanned. 
The event handler of EC is called, then you can insert or remove the Entity from Systems according to the Components it has at the moment.
Another option would simply make the entity aware of the entity controllers in order to signal "Hey, I have changed!". However should an entity know where it's currently attached to?
Whenever a Entity is added to a Entity Controller (EC), this EC registers to ComponentAdded and ComponentRemoved events from the Entity.
