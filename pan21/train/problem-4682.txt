In terms of noise, if you notice the current drive's noise then the move to an SSD will remove that. But if our laptops drive is very quiet (or just drowned out by other sound sources like fans) you won't notice that difference. The external 1.8" drive I use with my netbook is only audible if I do something that really rattles the drive heads (i.e. a large amount of fairly random access) if I put my ear less than a foot or so away from it - it makes no noticeable noise when spinning up or simply idlely spinning waiting for work to do. If you current drive is that quiet than an SSD won't make much difference to your noise levels unless it putting out less heat makes enough difference to the whole machine that it can power up the cooling fans less often or less aggressively.
The heat from your CPU and GPU will be more significant then the drive's output, especially when the machine is under load (i.e. running anything CPU and/or GPU intensive). An SSD will produce less waste heat than the motors of a spinning-disk drive, but whether this will be noticeable depends how efficient your current drive is and how much power the rest of the system is pumping around.
