On my computer (and apparently and Windows 8 and above), the Ctrl + Shift (not Alt + Shift) key combination is used to switch keyboard layouts. I disabled the Alt + Shift combination (that was theoretically active, but did not work) by going to Control Panel\Clock, Language and Region\Language\Advanced settings\Change Language Bar hotkeys ; but the Ctrl + Shift combination still switches keyboard layout, although it does not appear anywhere, and I cannot figure out why.
wasn't enough for me, I still had the problem. For those who still have the problem, I found here in the second page of answers, the one from Khalil Al Hooti on february 16th 2018 that I copy below :
With windows 10, there's also a problem that raises when using more than one computer (like your laptop and desktop) and win 10 syncs settings, hence the last used layout of one computer will be transfered to the other computer.
FINAL WORD: There are actually TWO hotkeys, one which changes input languages (which is, by default, Alt+Shift) and one which switches keyboard layouts (by default, Ctrl+Shift). 
to remove previously automatically added English (United Kingdom) language keyboard. first add the language from language preference, and the keyboard from the options. remove them again manually. 
"The reason is that your system local is set to English (United Kingdom). so whenever, you start typing in some program with non-Unicode characters, windows will use the default system local language to interpret these characters even if the language is not available in language bar. 
Below is the answer for anyone interested. It is in two parts for now, I'll edit it when I have time.
