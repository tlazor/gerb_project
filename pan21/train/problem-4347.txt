Now move the icon again, but this time reboot by pressing "Start" and selecting "reboot" from the 'shutdown'-selection menu. Upon the PC booting up again, the icon should in fact not have moved, and remain where you left it on the desktop.
When the PC has rebooted, is the icon still there, or has it in fact been moved back? It should have been moved back.
The Geek-site "How-To Geek" has a great article explaining BSOD's, why they occur, how to troubleshoot them (should you wish to), etc. - you can find it here: http://www.howtogeek.com/163452/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-blue-screen-of-death/ (at least I find it to be great).
It is, as far as I know, quite normal for Windows to 'lose' the settings upon an unexpected reboot or shutdown. The same would happen if you run a 'Force shutdown' command.
If you have ever logged into a domain, and then logged out again, and read what Windows said it was doing, one of the things Windows said it did was "saving your personal preferences" (or 'settings' or something similar - I only know what it says in Danish: "Gemmer dine personlige indstillinger"). If it is unexpectedly shut down (as it is by a BSOD), it won't save these personal settings.
The next time you boot up your Windows PC, try just moving an icon and then running the following command: shutdown -r -f -t 0 (the command explained: "shutdown" tells the PC it is about shutting down, th "-r" parameter, that it is a reboot-shutdown, the "-f"-parameter to force Windows down (hence the 'Force shutdown') and the "-t 0" is the "how much time"-parameter - "-t 0"-tells it to commence the shutdown immediately).
