Even though this was apparently not a detrimental move in previous versions of MacOS (see the "Alternatively:" section of the link), resizing the Mac partition in current versions of MacOS makes the Windows partition unbootable. The Windows partition now no longer shows up at all on the boot menu (the menu that displays on boot while holding the Option key).
I found multiple instances online where people fixed their Bootcamp partition by booting into a Windows 7 Install/Recovery USB and choosing the "Repair your computer" option (Example).
I acquired a MacBook recently with a Windows 7 Bootcamp partition. I wanted to make more space for the Windows partition, so used MacOS' Disk Utility to shrink the MacOS partition.
I did not know which version of Windows 7 was installed on this machine, so I acquired a Windows 7 x64 SP1 Professional ISO and used Bootcamp to install the ISO onto my 4GB flash drive. I was successfully able to boot into the Windows 7 USB, but when I selected "Repair your computer," I got the following error:
I therefore assume that the problem is that the Windows Partition is using a Windows 7 x64 OS of an edition other than Professional. Is there a way for me to know what version of Windows is installed from the MacOS side so I can acquire the correct boot/recovery disc?
