And then remove any matching lines.  Whereby "remove" I mean "remove them from the file but preserve them for posterity in case you remove the wrong things".
After reboot: active network interface = eth1, with a DHCP address. Network manager shows eth0 as disconnected, and not connectable. When I try to set eth1 up with the static IP address (same one), it says "In Use". I then tried ifconfig eth0 172.31.2.29 just to free it up from the eth0 interface so I could use it with eth1 (since this is connected). 
I have a virtual machine with Mandriva 2007.0 (yes, old - unfortunately we do not have a choice here). Anyway, the problem:
Nothing else changed. Any ideas what could be happening, or at least how I can get my IP address back?
Guessing here (been a while since I saw Mandriva) but if this was Redhat I'd check that you do not have a HWADDR= line in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0. If that line exists it will not apply the eth0 configuration to a network adapter with a different MAC address.
If Kudzu is installed on your system, try removing it.  If the MAC address of your interface has changed for some reason, Kudzu will interpret this as a new network card and result in the behavior that you've described.
And finally, what happens if you try to ping the address and then look it up on the arp table with arp -an?
Before reboot: active network interface = eth0. No other interfaces present, and network manager confirms this. Static IP address set to 172.31.2.22. No issues, everything working properly, routing et al.
