The cables don't have to be custom-manufactured for each device; however, only analog signals will ever be output from a VGA port, and only digitial signals will ever be output from an HDMI port. So, it's really not an HDMI adapter at all; rather, it's a simple DE-9 to HDMI adapter.
You can't convert between analog and digital signals with an electromechanical adapter such as this one. That's why you don't see DVI to component video, etc. adapters, except for highly specialized circumstances.
As there is no standard for the conversion between these two connectors, the pin configurations will vary between implementations. Thus, no cable can be guaranteed to work with any one device. In addition, plugging one of these into a digital-only display might fry something, as the signal is still analog. (And vice versa, if you're using it in the other direction.)
By the way, when analog video is transmitted through a DE-9, IIRC there are actually different implementations of the "VGA" video standard, which are not compatible with one another.
