Visual studio is an IDE for developement and compiling. It benefits from a fast CPU. When compiling a large project with thousands of small source files it also benefits from fast IO.
The E5-1680 will win it from the E5-2650 when you do relative simple tasks. It has a higher clock speed (both base and turbo'd). It has a bigger cache. It seems superior. If you have to choose between a single E5-1680v2 and a single E5-2650v2 then the choice is clear. 
The same is true in your case, though you gave a reasonable good description of your goals. I am keeping the answer rather generic though because answers are supposed to help future readers. Not just the original poster of the question.
The dual 2650 setup however has some differences which can turn into big advantages. Lets iterate over these differences:
the second machine is a more expensive then the first one. The question is: is there an advantage in working speed with the second machine?
I must do a decision between the following two systems with different CPU's. I asking me, is there a difference/advantage when I use the dual cpu machine for working Visual Studio 2013 (or higher) and SQL-Server 2014?
