My question therefore, is comparing a 4K TV to a 1080p TV for a given 1080p source. Am I correct in assuming, the 1080p TV will do better than the 4K TV at displaying the 1080p signal? (assuming again, text)
If you're watching 1080p video and you aren't used to actual 4K content, it'll look just fine. If you are used to 4K content, you may note a slight blurriness since the 1080p content is being upscaled to 4K and there's no way to perfectly add the additional pixels other than through guessing (via techniques such as interpolation). 
I've never seen a monitor that can display text in its non-native resolution without looking fuzzy. While Video, Images, and Games look decent, you can tell that scaling is occurring. Now, there are people that say if your source is some multiple of the display (for example 960x540 on a 1080p display), it will look perfect; which in my experience is incorrect, especially for text.
That said, I find the blurring minimal for video. For games it's a slightly more noticeable (but not distracting) because of the excessively sharp silhouettes you get from 3D rendered content.
If you're comparing 1080p content side-by-side on a 4K display and a 1080p display, it's unlikely that you'll notice a difference. (The 1080p content is scaled up on the 4K display so may look slightly less pixelated or slightly blurry depending on how you perceive things.)
