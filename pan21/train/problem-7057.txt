In case it's helpful to anyone coming across this post, as of Apache 2.4 (which wasn't released when this question was originally asked), the documentation no longer has the experimental warning regarding BufferedLogs.  Now it only warns that a server crash may cause loss of log data [i.e. any log entries which haven't been written to disk yet because they are buffered in memory wouldn't be able to be written due to the crash] - see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#bufferedlogs.
Another word of caution can be found on http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/PerformanceScalingUp#Logging_and_Performance which indicates BufferedLogs being on could cause the log entries to be written out of order.  My guess is this would only be the case if multiple VirtualHosts / sites were logging to the same file, but it doesn't clarify in which case(s) this might be expected to happen, and it's possible it applies to even one VirtualHost / site.  The page also isn't clear if this applies to all versions or just certain versions.
