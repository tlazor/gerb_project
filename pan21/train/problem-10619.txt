In addition to the advice recommended by Eric and Jeff, you may be able to benefit from paper prototyping.  Once you have come up with several ideas for game mechanics, you could try using paper prototyping to flesh them out quickly.  This could also be useful for identifying bad game mechanic ideas without wasting any time actually programming these game mechanics.
Lastly, just like everyone else said, play games to get ideas, and prototype your ideas to see if they are fun.
I want to make a puzzle game, but I don't know how to start. I have observed that each puzzle game has a core mechanic that enables opportunity for numerous puzzles. I'm not sure how to think of ideas. I was wondering how to come up with ideas for my game. I do not want any of your ideas because I want the game to be original.
You can try combining two different gameplay mechanics into one to create a brand new game (e.g. Gunpoint combines stealth and puzzle gameplay mechanics).
If you can not think of any good ideas or what gameplay mechanics to combine, you could use this random mechanic mixer which will combine different gameplay mechanics. At the bottom of the page is a description of all the different gameplay mechanics.
Refer to Jasper Jules' Family Tree (http://www.jesperjuul.net/text/swapadjacent/index_image006.jpg) of match 3 games. Each one challenges an underlying rule/premise for the game. What if we held time constant? What if the Match 3 was circular? 
I've noticed several partipants of the Ludum Dare use paper prototyping in their efforts to create a game in 48 hours.  They've said good things about it, and it seemed to be pretty beneficial for those who made puzzle games.
What makes Match 3 really interesting and popular (Candy Crush is currently the #1 game on Facebook) is that the basic mechanics are very familiar, but it's an iterative twist.
What is interesting is the ability to piece different existing pieces together in some kind of remix.
