HP DL360 - DL 5xx servers. Special hardware like 4x 8 core CPUS and 256 Gigs ram, serial cards for telecomm interfaces, or High end fax boards attached to multiple phone lines. Included in this group would be servers that the vendor has required large local storage. 
What are you needing this environment for? Vendor software or your organization doing their own development?
Dunno if this will help but both HP and Dell would fall all over themselves to come in and assess your current datacenter and give you a recommendation to revamp or create from scratch. The forum readers can give good close answers but without seeing "what you have and where you are to what you want and where you need to be" will be difficult to give you a solid answer. Do yourself a favor and stick with one hardware vendor because administration reasons.
These would be for machines that require a large quantity of RAM and CPU but have no unique hardware additions. Virtual machines are fine except when they require a huge amount of CPU or RAM. VMWare allows for vmotion moving the vmserver to a host machine as to balance out hardware usage. The VM real estate is only cost effective when used to its max. Meaning, more smaller machines instead of a few large ones. This also depends on the system you are trying to stand up.
This is an example but not a complete answer. Seriously, talk to a hardware vendor and let them give you an idea of where you are and how to make it it better/more efficient.
This allows us to limit spawl, electricity use and air conditioning costs. It would be used for test machines, Proof of concept servers, production servers that do not need hardware unique to the application (USB dongles, Fax boards, ect)
