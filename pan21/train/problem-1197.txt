Administrative Tools / Local Security Policy / Network List Manager Policies, double-click your network, tab Network location, and set its type to Private.
I have a feeling though that even if you go through the process of getting windows 7 to recognize the network correctly it may still not work. Unless you have setup the windows XP system to chare files, you may still have problems. XP is a lot more annoying to get setup especially since home and pro require different procedures to get working. I've seen a number of questions on the topic of "Setting up windows XP to share files" here on superuser. I do have yet another tutorial on how Microsoft says you should do this.
Normally when using a router the wired lan and the wireless lan are two different networks and are unable to see each other; i.e unable to share files. One way of allowing this is to create a virtual wireless network and bridge it with your wired network. You may or may not be able to do this depending on your router. 
It even has a video of how to do it. What you need to realize is that these default network types are configurable. You may need to do some additional tinkering to relax the security to make life easier. There are some extra features in windows that is supposed to make it easier to have a protected share. Here's another tutorial that talks about setting up a Win 7 box to allow people to connect to it. It mainly has some screens on how to get to the network type configurations. You will need admin privileges to move from public to home or work.
