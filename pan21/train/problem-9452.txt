The direction of the force applied to a point colliding with your rotating object is the tangent to the sphere, perpendicular to the axis the sphere is rotating on.  You should be able to calculate it with the following pseudo-code:
Lastly, the magnitude of the force would depend on the speed at which your object is rotating, and if you're feeling adventurous, the coefficient of friction of its surface.
To put that another way, let's say your sphere is rotating along the z-axis, (0, 0, 1).  You could either provide (0, 0, 1) or (0, 0, -1) to the cross product; both are along the z-axis.  Which one you provide will depend on the sign of the rotation.  If your object is rotating with a positive speed, you'd use the positive z-axis in the cross product.
A small detail to keep in mind is that the axisOfRotation will differ depending on whether the rotation is negative or positive, which in turn depends on whether you're in a right- or left-handed coordinate system; Unity, I believe, is left-handed.
