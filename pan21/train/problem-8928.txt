You can also use DiskPart to remove the active flag on your partition and then delete your unwanted partition. For usage, see the technet documentation for DiskPart. 
You can't delete an active partition, so you'll need to mark a different partition as Active. You should be able to mark the C: as Active, then delete the offending partition. If you aren't able to from within Windows, then you may need to use a Live CD/USB.
Your usage will probably be along the lines of select volume X, active,delete volume Y where X is a volume/partition you want to keep and Y is the offending partition you want to delete.
I bought a Kingston USB drive, and after unsuccessful install by Windows (7) I went to Kingston's support webpage and followed the instructions of how to make it work. I assumed the problem was the drive's letter (the letter 'E' was taken by a different USB drive) so I tried to change it to 'F.' I don't even know if it makes sense, but I ended up with another drive.    
I tried to delete it from the disk management, but no success. Is my only option now is to format Windows? Is there another solution?
