You will not be able to reduce the perceived choppy mouse movement in any way other that increasing the refresh rate of the display.
With 30hz a see a mouse lag.  I am fine with the video and look of the monitor though.  Question is, is there a way to get rid of the mouse lag?  I purchased the computer 5 or so years ago so it is time for a new one.  I was thinking an i7 6 core 3.5 or the i7 8 core extreme 3.0.  Do you think this and a 4gb video card will remove the mouse lag?  Or is mouse lag on 30hz just a defect of 30hz no matter what processing power you have?
I just spent 3 weeks banging on this problem and wrote up a summary of the solutions and workarounds 
I surely would have loved to seen a single coherent list of ways to solve the mouse lag on 4K screens when I started.  There are many 'hair brain" recommendations floating around the internet that seems to be designed to waste your time or get into arguments.  
I have a computer that I need to run about 15 meters or 50 feet away from the monitors.  Currently I have two DVI monitors that have resolution of about 2500x1600.  I want to run two 4k monitors instead 3840 x 2160.  Since this is run very far I have to transfer the signal to something else to run it.  I have already purchased two Gefen 4k HDMI to Cat5 converters http://www.gefen.com/kvm/gtb-hdmi-3dtv-blk.jsp?prod_id=9420  Everything else I saw displayport converters extenders ext does not run full 3840 x 2160.  The Gefen ones only run 30hz though.  This is not Gefens fault but a limitation of hdmi.
