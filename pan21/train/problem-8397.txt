Without realizing what I was getting into, I accidentally selected Windows Media Center (if I remember correctly it was selected by default) and then I clicked OK.
To my horror, whichever program I try to run now starts the Windows Media Center. Here are a few things I have already tried:
This is what solved it for me. The complete solution is available at support.microsoft.com which probably makes the link unlikely to go dead anytime soon.
Something really strange happened about 10 minutes ago. I tried to open a file named pdfsam.exe and instead of running it, Windows 7 asked me to choose a program to open the file with.
I am completely at a loss here. Apparently I am the only idiot on the internet to have done this (or I am not able to ask Google the right question). I am worried that after I shutdown this browser I won't be able to open it again. The next thing I am going to try is to perform a system restore to a past date. If that fails all I will be left to is to perform searches using my smartphone.
I guess half the battle is won by getting to the command prompt. The rest of the solution provided on the link works of course, but most experienced users of the Windows OS can perhaps manage without it as well.
