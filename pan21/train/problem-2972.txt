The option of a trigger of the type "at session startup on the desktop, launch SyncToy and pump the pictures from laptop" is not preferred either since it will hog resources at startup. Since I don't use the desktop on a reliable basis (i.e. online time are rather random) I cannot set up a task at a specific time either.
I do not want a solution of the type "Home Network" as I want to physically transfer pictures from one computer to another.
After a bad experience with lost pictures, I would like to automatically back up photos from the laptop to the desktop.
The reason why I want a trigger of the type "when desktop connects to the network, run SyncToy on laptop" is because I don't want a task that will start with very little chance of success (as the desktop is not online often).
For this, I have set up a sync pair with Synctoy 2.1 (left folder=Images on laptop ; right folder=Images on desktop) and it works manually. I have found this link which deals with setting up a scheduled task. I tried fiddling a bit with that but no luck so far.
