The theory is that with modern Journaling File Systems the data is written is such a way that any changes to the filesystem can either be rolled back (if you crashed while writing a large file that cannot be completed within the simplistic bounds of the journal)  or continue to roll forward (i.e. file rename or deletion) so that the system is either in the state that it was before the operation or is as close to the intended state as possible.  This system is not infallable.
Presumably these "experts" were using the tried and trusted method of starting the machine, waiting for the hard drive light to stop flashing (i.e. the system is not actually using the drive) and then removing the power at the time when least damage is likely to occur.  If I were doing the testing I would do the following:
In practice this randomly removing power may not cause problems with the filesystem (due to journaling) but a random power spike or act of dog during some critical operation such as partition resizing or formatting could put the system into a very bad state.
For best effect try resizing your Windows partition and then remove the power, see if your machine is fine after that.
