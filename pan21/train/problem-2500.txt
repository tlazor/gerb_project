Now, can I make a SSH tunnel and use his network without being detected the same way as MAC spoof? Will all the usage be shown as done by him or can I somehow be seen that there is an SSH tunnel active that has been using a research scholar's internet? If not, will creating multiple SSH hops be any good?
This will create a SOCKS proxy listening to home port 1234, and redirecting traffic through univ machine. You can then configure this proxy in your browser.
One last thing.How exactly is a private key of any use while doing an SSH? Will it help in giving any form of anonymity from the sysadmin?
As for the PKI employed, the purpose of it is exactly opposite of anonymization.  PKI is used as a method to authenticate that the and user are actually who they claim to be.
My friend gets faster internet in my university as he has some research scholar facilities.Our sysadmin has made sure this feature can be only accessed by a few machines with a particular MAC addresses. MAC spoofing has been detected by him by some means and hence that theory has already been put to a test.
This seems like a way to get your 'friend' in trouble.  The sysadmin can almost certainly see the existence of communication between the privileged host, and other systems within the network.  The sysadmin can also probably see outgoing communication from the privileged host to the rest of the world.  So even if he doesn't see your SSH session, he may believe your friend is abusing his privilege.
So, yes, the sysadmin can detect it. No, it won't be the same procedure as MAC spoofing. And using username+password or username+key makes no difference.
