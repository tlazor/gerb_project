Building on Gale's answer, I made the formula/math a little simpler, and I added my working C# code. I've built this in Unity, and used the same variables as Gale did.
// Final Out: If(combinedAngle > maxSAngle or < minSAngle), where the max and min angle is measured from rotation axis (0,-1) then arm can't reach the point.
THis code loops through all the grips (points) and for each one checks if it is reachable, given the constraints of the arm.
// What are the angles for the direction of SE respective to SH + SH respective to the (0,-1) rotation limit axis
// 3. Add the length of SE to the x of the vector towards the end effector to find the position of H
At this point, we know the absolute values of the angle Sang between (SE and Sdef) and the angle Eang between (SE and EH), but not the signed value.
The question is only asking for, "Can the arm reach the point?" However, the next question would typically be, "What angles do I set each joint to so that the arm is touching the point?" My first answer describes the set up nicely, so using the terms of the answer, I will answer the followup question.
