What will this command to? I am considering running it in a VM, but I don't have one set up and I don't want to waste my time if it does nothing. I also don't want to run it on my system, either, in case it is dangerous. 
as a command to me that I should run. I am too nervous to try, however, because someone else on the internet mentioned that it seemed "relatively harmless..."
Under modern Unix systems, these "special" files are made and dynamically maintained by a hardware detection process - udev or systemd under Linux, for example.  But it is possible to have a completely static system where these are manually made (via mknod is one way) if the hardware in the system does not change - before the prevalence of Plug-and-Play interfaces (e.g. various Unices in the 70's, 80's and early 90's), this was common.
"" is a null string, meaning nothing, but echo adds a newline unless the -n switch is specified, so echo "" outputs a newline to stdout (redirected to /dev/null in the example).
If you are running this under Windows' Linux Subsystem for Windows, I'm not sure how it makes these files, but the LXSS is probably presenting a virtual version of them to programs that run under the subsystem for compatibility.  (Windows has a "Null" device driver if you look in devmgmt.msc under "Non Plug-and-Play Devices" - the LXSS is probably doing things behind the scenes to make /dev/null really use that Windows driver.)  Cygwin, another software that presents a Linux subsystem, does this too.
/dev/null is a standard Unix device driver that simply throws away what it receives.  It's often used to throw away unwanted output or for testing.
