Sharing a single mailbox isn't an option either because both users have different methods or organizing and tracking their emails, so I do want two seperate distinct mailboxes that contain ALL of the emails.
So basically, emails to joe@domain should be sent to joe's mailbox and john's mailbox. Emails to john@domain should be sent to joe's mailbox and john's mailbox. And emails sent by either user (in outlook, this really isn't the hard part) should be sent from their own personal accounts.
I'm hoping someone can help me out, I'm rather new to the exchange thing, so its possible that I'm missing something simple. In case it matters, we are running SBS 2008, but I'm fully comftorable in exchange mangement console/shell.
I have a bit of an interesting email situation I'm trying to set up for a small business, that is probably far from normal, but I'm hoping someone can send me along the right path.
Suppose I have two users, joe and john with emails joe@domain and john@domain. Both of these users share many of the same responsibilities, and trust between the two users is not an issue, so each of them wants to see the other's emails and wants the other to see his. However, each wants to send from their own personal email address.
How about a distribution list?  We use a lot of distribution lists setup at work and you can add/remove people from it with relative ease.
