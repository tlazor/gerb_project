You can use a CNAME for, say, www.example.com, so that it points to magic-squirrel.herokuapp.com (or whatever).  magic-squirrel.herokuapp.com will resolve to whatever IP Heroku has assigned to that end point, for example, 1.1.1.1.  That IP can change if Heroku needs to do some network reconfiguration, but magic-squirrel.herokuapp.com will be updated to point to, say, 2.2.2.2.  www.example.com will follow naturally, after TTL expiration.  In this case, you won't have a service disruption because of something Heroku did to manage their network.
You cannot use a CNAME for example.com, the naked domain.  You instead will need to use an A record.  As above, your app is running on magic-squirrel.herokuapp.com, which has an A record of 1.1.1.1.  Because you can't CNAME to that name, you will have to create an A record for example.com to point to 1.1.1.1.  Sometime later, Heroku does their network configuration, and magic-squirrel.herokuapp.com now points to 2.2.2.2.  Your example.com is now mysteriously broken.  You will need to notice that magic-squirrel.herokuapp.com no longer is on 1.1.1.1 and update your DNS accordingly.
