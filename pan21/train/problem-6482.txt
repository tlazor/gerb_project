You may want to check with your IT Department to see if you need to install a Cert to talk to your exchange server.  Also, try inputting your company's Lync server in the "Advanced" options when you access the Lync settings.  Hope this helps. 
If the latter, you can't just install the certificate that the Lync server is sending you, you also need to install the entire certificate chain that goes with it into your local cert repository. That might mean Intermediate and Root CAs, or just one root CA.
I Think this is caused by not having the rights to get a certificate from the lync edge server, So suspect that the External access policy is set to null, rather than Allow External or Allow External + Federation
The proper way would have been to blockÂ lync/Skype from accessing the internal network while on VPN to force the connection to the Edge.  This resolves the certificate issue and it improves the performance issue as going through an encrypted vpn connection with an encrypted lync/skype connection is not optimal.  If there is no Edge then downloading the root and or intermediate certificate from your company would allow your non-domain machine to trust the internal certificate.
If the former, then have they correctly set up an Edge server for the Lync install? Or are they trying to just use the Front End server and making it's interfaces publically available over the internet?
How are you accessing the servers from your Home computer? Are you coming in from the internet via your home internet connection, or have you taken your computer with you to the office and plugged it into the network there?
