Any ideas? Is there maybe an alternative how I can get this at a later stage? Waiting using a ping to 127.0.0.1 also doesn't help. Is there some other service that might not be loaded yet?
Therefore I thought that some network related service might not be completely loaded yet and I tried to run "ipconfig /renew" to assure that the system has a valid IP, but this didn't help. I also thought that it could be due to DNS name resolution, so I manually started the dns client, with no success. It also seems that the share is not reachable when using the IP address, so I can't figure out the cause.
In addition to that, I needed to put the commands into a separate script, which was called in the GuiRunOnce:
I have seemed to figure it out after googling around some more hours. The service "lanmanworkstation" was obviously not started yet, which seems to be responsible for connections to other systems, e.g. for network shares. After starting the service, I was able to access the share and copy the file(s).
As mentioned in the title, I am currently creating an automized deployment of VMs using VMware PowerCLI. Everything works fine so far, until I want to execute some scripts in the GuiRunOnce section after the SysPrep customization. My goal is to copy some files from a network share to the newly created VM, but there I have the problem that the network share is not reachable. When I "leave" the GuiRunOnce part and the OS loads properly, the network share is reachable just fine with the same script which was run during the GuiRunOnce.
