So far I able to utilize ssh-agent.exe by changing environment setting in my home account manually to set an environment variable as follow:
You need to run cygwin once to start the agent, but after that it doesn't have to be running. This could probably be setup as a service as well.
The environment variable should not set in cmd box or else other process accessing ssh.exe may not recognize the environment variable.  It has to set in Windows user account.
I would like to access a SSH service with pass-phrase protected private key in Windows using ssh-agent.exe.  
Is there any good way to automate the launching of ssh-agent and setting the SSH_AUTH_SOCK in the context of native Windows session?
This doesn't quite accomplish what you are looking for (running ssh-agent without cygwin), but it works perfectly for storing keys in memory.
When you run ssh-agent you should save the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID environment variables to a file, and use them to see if the agent is already running.
