The best connection you are going to get from a pi to anything is via USB, but that does not include normative peer-to-peer network connections (unless you get, e.g., a gigabit ethernet adapter).  As Darth Vader points out, the USB and the ethernet jack share a bus, but the top speed of the USB side of things is much higher than the top speed of the ethernet side of things.
You can reliably get 1 Mbps (i.e., 125 KB/s) duplex connections using the UART, but this is much slower than normal networking.
The ethernet jack is the second fastest and is capable of a normal, network connection.  In theory most wifi adapters are potentially faster, but in practice this is unlikely to be the case.  However, connection via wifi on a LAN can be roughly on par with connection via ethernet on a LAN.
A direct connection using an ethernet cable may be faster, but I do not think substantially so -- it may simply be more convenient, since you don't need a LAN, intermediate router, etc.
After two or threes years using B/B+/2B models, in practice I would say the USB tops out around 30 MB/s and the ethernet may do 10 MB/s in bursts but is more likely to sustain 6-8 on average, given no other bottlenecks.
