I found what the solution is. I ran tests against 2 versions of ImageMagick - 6.5.1 and 6.5.7. The old version comes with Ubuntu Karmic 9.10, the newer one with Ubuntu Lucid 10.04. Both 64-bit versions. I noticed the 6.5.7 version is faster than 6.5.1 and also does not load the server that much. It produced normal single digit load as one could expect. For both versions mogrify was multithreaded. 
The solution is to stop doing graphics processing, or at least do less of it - update whatever is calling mogrify so it can't run as many parallel tasks.  If that isn't an option split the load (add another server and send some of the work there).
Note that if your load average is 130 and your system is still responsive and doing everything you need it to do in a timely fashion you don't have a problem, you have a "problem" (It doesn't look good, at a glance any sysadmin will tell you it's probably something bad and you should look at solutions like what I described above, but if it's not hurting anything and it doesn't get substantially worse as you scale up you may be able to ignore it as "normal for this environment").
