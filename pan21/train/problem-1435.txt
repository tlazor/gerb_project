TRENDnet Tk-407 etc on linux distros Install   numlockx then use numlock + numlock to change to another pc.
I'm using Arch Linux, and I just upgraded to GNOME 3 with GNOME Shell. I have a KVM switch, which says in the instruction manual to press the Scroll Lock key twice to switch modes. Scroll Locks has never worked for some reason, but pressing Num Lock did work.
I had a similar situation a few years ago when I switched from Windows XP to Vista. A USB KVM I had would not work with the keyboard I had with Vista installed. I wound up purchasing a new keyboard. I had a Razer Tarantula which I replaced with a Saitek Cyborg, and then the switching feature worked fine.
Anyway, since I upgraded to GNOME 3, nothing works to switch modes. The indicators on my keyboard say that the button itself is working, but something is different about GNOME 3 that is preventing my KVM from switching.
I think, but am not 100% sure, that during the course of my testing I had gotten the Tarantula keyboard to work on the mouse port of the KVM, but then of course I couldn't use the mouse.
I've contacted customer support regarding my Trendnet TK-209, but they haven't been able to find a solution. I doubt I will be able to resolve this issue. I'm marking this answer as a community wiki, so if anyone does find a solution, feel free to edit my "accepted" answer.
