In my opinion, I would continue running the latest 2.6.x kernel.  It's been out for a long time, has been and is widely deployed and tested, and your vendor will likely be providing patches for some time.  
How long you wait for a kernel to be stable, and what you would classify as stable are different questions. A newer kernel (especially if its provided by your distro) is perfectly stable for 99% of cases.
If you need a stable version of the Linux kernel then you should be using one of the stable releases. In the 2.6 series these had a fourth version number. In the 3.0 series it is the third version number.
In my opinion, 3.0 is just too new to put out on real production systems.  (I'm talking money generating systems here, not a server that runs a personal blog or photo gallery or the like.)  When company money and your job are at stake, I feel it's best to stick with what is known and what works.
Better yet is to let a major distribution do this for you. Redhat Enterprise (and clones like CentOS and Scientific Linux), Ubuntu Server, SUSE or Debian all have stable versions which will have kernels that contain important bugfixes while not including unstable new features.
3.0 is identical to 2.6. Linus simply thought that the numbers were getting too big at 2.6.40 so anything after that point is called 3.0.
I personally would have no problem using 3.x on production servers, as long as I had a cluster or failover that could quickly replace any system with a problem. 3.0 is just a new name for 2.6.40. It's no more unstable than any new 2.6 kernel release.
