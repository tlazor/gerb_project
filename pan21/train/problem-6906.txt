I have set up a mission list and can complete them etc. The whole game is almost ready to build several levels with and then hopefully have anend product that resembles a real PC game.
Hi everyone I have made myself a little SWAT action FPS style game. I have the basis of the code very well set up (by my standards!) and can easily add enemies where I want that all act differently by ticking different options in them.
Here's a screenshot to show what I mean. I understand this question will give rise to opinion based answers, but I'm really low on ideas so anything better than an invisible wall or a brick wall would be very welcome. 
My problem: The edge of the level. I've made a 'training level' that is very small. Its 60mx60m gamemap . The level works fine but I have these edges where you can fall off the world. I could of course put a brick wall, or an invisible wall, but I thought I would ask you knowledgable folks here at gamedev for some advise and options. 
But this is unchartered waters for me. Normally I can overlook all the rough edges as I am just learning, but I am really happy with this and want to try making it into a full game. 
Could I somehow dump my level on top of an image or plane of images to give illusion of being in a city? or would I need to create buildings in 3d just for background objects? (if not I can always give in for now and use a big brick wall lol)
