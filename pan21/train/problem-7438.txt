Well, I tried baking it, and nope, there is no magic bullet to revive old graphics cards. (when I plugged it in, I got crazy patterns of flashing multicolored lines across the screen. It looked like somebody having a nightmare while high on a hallucinogen :) Thank you all for your help, but I'm going to be making a trip to the local computer parts store today :)
You should check the bios if plug and play is enabled, if that's an option at all, and reboot into safe mode. From there follow directions to completely remove old drivers.
Remove all the PCI cards from the machine and boot it up.  Shut the machine down and add 1 PCI card in at a time, booting after each one.  Sometimes this can correct issues with PCI cards problems.
Then get the drivers from nvidia's site (not windows update) and install them. I understand you've done this once, but I think that incomplete removal of drivers or vista bundling in drivers that don't properly support the 7300LE though they think they do (the firmware can get changed) might be your issue.
