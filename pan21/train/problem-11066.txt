I recreated your issue in a lab environ today.  The problem I saw (which matched your description) was indeed caused by IPv6.  The machines tried to talk to each other over IPv6 first, and they connected over the non-private link since that route had a lower cost (same net).
I ran the Microsoft FixIt-20166 to prefer IPv4 over IPv6 and that fixed the problem.  Then, for giggles, I reverted the changes (there is a undo package on that same page) and manually adjusted the IPv6 addresses on the private link so they were on common net with no extra hops.  After registering the IPv6 addresses in my DNS (I was using named references in SQL) then the traffic started using the private link via IPv6.
Unless you test and get different results, this is what I expect you are encountering as well.  The IPv6 addresses are being used for the SQL-SQL communications, because windows prefers v6; and the IPv6 link over the public interface is being seen as lower cost than the private interface.  That is causing the traffic to travel over the lower cost (public) interface.  The way to change that would be to not prefer IPv6 (so the v4 family is used and your cost decreases on the private interface) or setup your IPv6 network on the private link so that the cost is decreased (both PCs on-net with one another).
