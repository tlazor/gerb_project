We are searching around a solution like a "high available transparent file system" that makes the fault transparent to the application, so in case of fault, redundant machine still can access the files even the master machine is down (replica issue or such a thing).
I'm searching around a solution for our enterprise application that is responsible to save(and manipulate) historical data of industrial devices. Now, we have two stations that works like hot redundant of each other. Our challenge is in case of failure. For now, our application is responsible to handling fault by synchronizing the files that changed during the fault, by itself. Our application is running on two totally independent machines (one as redundant) and so each one has its own disk.
there is solutions like distributed fault tolerant file systems, distributed-disk software-RAID like FlexRAID and some more solutions, but they all have some challenges and issues. Also it's notable that our application is a .net application and the hardware of machines are not so powerful and are commodity.
