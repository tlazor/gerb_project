On a related note, what is a good barebones set of packages that will give me the essentials, without fluff that I'll probably never run?
To cleanup a Cygwin install set (not the installed code base but the package used to DO the install... 
I would start with the basic cygwin package, and 'page-fault' in any additional commands you need.  I keep a list of common utilities which I use, but might be quite different from what you use.  Do NOT select ALL packages when you install Cygwin.  I did this once and it took about 6GB.  My thinking was then I'd never have to worry about not having a program.  It was a bad idea. 
I can't use Windows without installing Cygwin, but I've never really had too much of a problem with it using disk space though. I think you can delete the folder Cygwin stores the packages in but every time you update Cygwin it will download the packages it needs.
My Windows XP machine has 1.1 GB in service pack uninstall data.  I'd delete those files well before trying to trim down Cygwin.  Try using the WinDirStat program and see where all your hard drive space is going - it's probably not Cygwin.  Also, from time to time, you should probably delete C:\cygwin\tmp, as this doesn't get cleared on reboot.
As for a barebones setup, it really depends on what you need. I start with the base Cygwin install and add OpenSSH, Cron, RXVT, Screen, Vim, Git, Curl, Zip/Unzip, and Wget. Those are most all the tools I need, but I just install something else if the need arises.
I love using Cygwin, but I hate all of the extra disk space it seems to use caching stuff I don't need.  What can I delete to keep my installation footprint as small as possible?
