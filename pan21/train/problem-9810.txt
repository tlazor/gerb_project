We have an AWS Lambda (part of a broader AWS stack) that is configured using CloudFormation.  It is being demanded that we implement/configure X-Ray on this Lambda.  Company policy forbids us (on a role by role/account by account basis) from accessing the AWS console, which is part of why we're using CloudFormation to define our AWS stack; but it means we can't enable X-Ray through the AWS console (which is normally the way to do that).
Unfortunately, we haven't found documentation on using X-Ray with CloudFormation.  Reviewing the CloudFormation Release History we see that X-Ray does not, indeed, appear to be listed.  It seems CloudFormation does not support configuring Lambda with X-Ray in this way.
Thus, my question is ultimately, how much information can we get out of TracingConfig, and how close would that get us to the information that would otherwise be provided by X-Ray if we were able to use that?
We also discovered something called TracingConfig, which can be enabled via CloudFormation.  However, there isn't much documentation on what this does, or what the output looks like/where it goes.  The hopeful tidbit of information we found relating to this is that documentation on both TracingConfig and X-Ray mentions in passing something they call "active tracing."
