Deleting temporary files, ranging from program setup left overs, to cookies, could free as much as 2gbs, depending on how often you clean it.
1.) Turn Off system restore, then turn it back On and then create a manual system restore point, this will clean up a gig or more of disk space, do this right before you back up.
Always delete you're temporary internet files, as well as system temporary files.  I haven't used XP in a while, so I'm not sure where those files are stored. I'm guessing many are under C:/Temp/.  Either way, windows comes with a disk cleanup utility. All of the places it offers to clean should be acceptable locations to delete files from, as long as you don't know of anything off hand that you need from there. Let me know if you can't find the disk cleanup utility and I will try and find it for you.
4.) Delete any "user" account(s) you don't need anymore. Be careful what you do here, if there is only one user account Do Not delete it.
hit enter key (be very careful to type the erase command correctly, space between e and *, between p and / also)
