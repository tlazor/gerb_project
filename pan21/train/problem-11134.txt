I love the netlabels section of Archive.org for this purpose. Lots and lots of interesting music that is [mostly] freely available for use (check individual licenses). Great search capability too.
The site likes to mention that you should pay up for Jamendo Pro in order to use tracks for commercial works, but if the track is under a compatible Creative Commons licence (ie, CC-BY), then you don't have to pay up (although obviously its always a good idea to make sure the music creator gets a share of the profits, they deserve it!)
Jamendo has a massive collection of excellent quality music tracks which are mostly under various Creative Commons licenses:
If you're interested in creating a large amount of music (for one game or many in the future), I'd recommend grabbing some easy to use music creation software (like GarageBand on OSX, or ACID on Windows). It's pretty easy to create some basic tracks with the included samples, and you can pretty affordably find more samples.
Look out for the "No Derivatives" tag. The definition of a derivative work is somewhat vague, so its best to avoid them, or ask the artist/composer. "Share-Alike" could also be a bit iffy.
Don't think you can write music? Do what I've done for a long time: stitch together the classics. Go to your local music store and find some sheet music for Beethoven or other copyright-expired orchestrations. Don't borrow the whole arrangements (they're often copyrighted), but grab a few bars of the melody or harmony. Shift it a few keys or try it with some odd instrumentation. The results can be pretty solid.
When it comes to music that is mostly original, I am very fond of the Newgrounds Audio Portal. Of course you have to ask for permission first, and abide by the Creative Commons restrictions that the creator has placed, but in general its very nice.
Of course, if the track is under a non-compatible CC licence, then you will have to pay up, or ask the artist nicely.
