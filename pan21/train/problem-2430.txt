By changing frequency and amplitude I know I can change the resulting terrain, varying it from rolling hills to jagged peaks. However the end result will always be the same: either never ending hills or never ending mountains. I don't understand really how I would mix those two "terrain structures" together to get area's of hills and area's of mountains.
The way I(And I believe many others) do it is to have not only one noise generator, but multiple ones, configured differently, and then interpolate between them based on some value(perhaps chunk type, perhaps just another noise function). Also generating a specific terrain type is more feasible by combining multiple noises too.
The website of libnoise has some nice information about all this, and also about the various noise generation and mixing techniques.
Currently I'm making a voxel survival game. About a month ago I embarked on procedurally generating terrain using Perlin noise. I understand how to use and apply it for the most part. However I do not understand how to vary terrain structure. Let me say that in a way you probably can understand because "me no grammar good".
