As noted by others in comments, there isn't a really good reason for this that I can think of, so yeah I too would probably ask that you elaborate. 
When you say 'AD Entries' are you referring to everything below _msdcs in your zones? THe promotion process generally does that rather than them being created by the DC on the fly, but given past interactions with Microsoft PFE (Premier Field Engineering) they would be re-registered by the DC if deleted; however we certainly wouldn't have had DDNS disabled.
That said, I've been through a process with them on site at work where I intentionally tore an AD apart (they call it AD Rescue) and put it back together again. When things go missing under that directory/segment of your DNS you start getting very unusual errors that you have to be very careful with and I think what you're proposing there centers around the DC's NIC and it's own IPv4/IPv6 record, NOT any of the Active Directory service records and the like.
Given what you've provided I could only say spin up a test domain in an isolated VM test environment and give it a try to see if does what you expect, I'd be more than willing to bet Microsoft may reject support of such a configuration though even if your company carries an Enterprise Agreement.
