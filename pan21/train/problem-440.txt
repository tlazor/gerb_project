I haven't run into this problem with losing my settings, but you should be able to back up your preferences by simply making a copy of C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\vlc (or equivalent location on your machine).
Drag everything (except the $PLUGINSDIR in the installer) into the C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC folder (or other destination). You will need to do this as Administrator and answer Yes to *Overwrite current files?" 
This should not affect preferences, whether stored locally or in the Registry. However, manually updating does have a small risk that some current setting may not work well with the new version. That said, I've never had an issue using manual update.
Open the file in a utility such as 7-Zip [Yes, even the installer executable is compressed, and can be unpacked!].
To restore your settings, first make sure VLC isn't running, and then just replace that folder with your backup copy.
This has happened more than once. Is there any way to stop it? Or any way to back them up at least? Using Windows 10.
