I was asked by a friend to clean her laptop (mainly the fan) because it hadn't been cleaned in more than 4 years and was rather slow and noisy. I found a tutorial to follow just to be sure and opened it up. Once I reached to the fan, there were loads of dirt which I cleaned. But after piecing it back together (like in the tutorial), it shuts down 5 minutes after being turned on (best case). It is still quite noisy, though I wouldn't be able to make a good comparison to before. I am quite sure that the laptop does not seem to be overheating or even heating at all. The tutorial is here
In that 5 minute window you can install HWMonitor and check to see if the overheating is what makes it shut down.
Now, something that I did not do was replacing the thermal paste (~ min 10:00). On a second thought this may be very relevant. I've never opened up a laptop before and barely had a screwdriver. 
The linked tutorial tells to clean off old thermal paste, if you did that and running without it - it is obviously the reason.
And even if the old paste is still in place - over these years it must have been dried out and still cannot provide good enough contact (in fact it may be even worse than with no paste at all)
