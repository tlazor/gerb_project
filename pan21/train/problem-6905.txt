No one can tell, but the trend seems to be that DS will be adopted universally by tech companies in the future. From what I can tell you'll have no problem at all finding a well paying job right out of college.
Personally, I think no. DS at the moment is very undermanned in the labor market and demand is rising like crazy. To fill this demand there will be a lot of former programmers with a heavy CS background and years of experience making the transition. This, however, will change when people with DS degrees flood the market and I don't think it will be as easy in the future for CS to shift to DS, as it is now...
I am also planning on getting either a masters or PhD in DS/ML. I don't know if it would better to get a lower level understanding of computers like I would probably get in a CS curriculum and then just focus on data science in grad school.      
I'm going to be applying for college soon and some of my choices have a data science undergrad. I've taken some online courses on introductory data analysis and have been doing kaggle projects for awhile, so I know it's something I enjoy. The only questions I have are:
Since most DS majors have been developed the past 2-3 years they tend to be well structured and curated. Their subjects are usually a mix of some theoretical background (e.g. stats, linear algebra), some basic programming courses (usually python or R) and some ML topics at a near state-of-the-art level.
