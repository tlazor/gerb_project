For me, this still hardly answers the question. I mean, CON: should be something different that "C:\CON" or "C:\CON.txt", shouldn't it? As far as I know, any file or folder or driver on anything is being fully identified by the string containing it's full location (including the drive followed by a : sign at the beginning) and (optionally) it's type extenstion. Therefore I can't see how, for example, the existance of a file "C:\Documents and Settings\Someone\Desktop\c.docx" could result in any ambiguity, as it should be obvious that this Word document is not the C: drive. And similary I can't see how the existance of "C:\Documents and Settings\Someone\Desktop\con.docx" could result in Windows not knowing whether this is a Word document or the console.
But everything I could find was that CON, COM1, AUX, etc are restricted because they have special meaning - for example, "CON:" mens console. And therefore writing to CON: will result in the text popping up in the console (checked that myself - typing echo "asdf" > CON: indeed resulted in "asdf" showing up).
