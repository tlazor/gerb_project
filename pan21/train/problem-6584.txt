If you have SNI support, then my suggestion would be to generate an individual, trusted certificate for each site/domain/subdomain you need. Don't fret, with the advent of Let's Encrypt from the EFF, getting as many trusted certificates as you need is trivial.
If you do not have SNI support (due to old clients, or a version of IIS that does not support this), then a SAN certificate might be the way to go. Again, you can get these from Let's Encrypt. Just generate a single cert with all the SANs you required. But every time you change the list of domains you need coverage for, you have to regenerate your certificate (and depending on how you have deployed it, you might have to deploy it to every applicable host again). However, you have indicated that this is not ideal for you, as you want to maintain seperation between many of these domains.
Apart from SNI with individual certs, and a SAN cert, the 3rd common way is to put something like Cloudflare infront of all your sites, and let them do the SSL certificates for you. The nice thing about this is that you get your SSL termination latency reduced too, as clients do their SSL negotiation with Cloudflare, with presumably a closer POP than you would have on your own.
There's multiple options here, and the important one is whether or not your server and client infrastructure supports SNI.
