To my knowledge, this can actually be a limitation in the hardware, so you might have to get a new keyboard. Does it work correctly in other computers and/or with other operating systems?
For anyone still having this problem, I've run into a similar issue recently, and I found out something interesting. How many keys I could push was actually affected by the USB port I was using. I found this out after moving my computer, and apparently plugging it into a different port than normal, where two button combinations that normally worked no longer did. After switching to a different port, the problem was resolved.
Almost all consumer keyboards have combinations that don't work. It is unfortunate, but you just have to find the dead combinations and avoid using those keys for gaming.
This is a hardware limitation, as the other answers suggest.  I used to have the exact same problem gaming with an older logitech keyboard that had a 3-key rollover.  Cheap keyboards frequently have this problem.
However, even cheapo keyboards typically support 3-key rollover in which case you should not be able to hit a jamming combination with just two keys. If that's what's happening you have either a hardware fault or a spectacularly rubbish keyboard.
If you want to ensure that you never have to deal with this issue again, I suggest purchasing a das keyboard, which has N-key rollover.  In other words, you could be pressing every key on the keyboard at once, and all of the keystrokes would still register.
