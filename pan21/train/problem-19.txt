When editing the footer on a slide master, its child layouts automatically inherit the footer text. However, after accidentally editing a layout, they are not in sync anymore. I always have to edit the text on the slide master and some layouts separately.
I had the same problem.  To fix, I duplicated the layout that I wanted to use, applied that layout to the slides where I needed the footer (for me this was all slide except the title slide).  Then I added the footer from the insert menu and selected apply to all slides.  I don't know why it would not do that from my original layout but it worked fine from the duplicated layout.
If I'm correct about the cause, you'll need to select and delete the footers/etc on the affected slides, then choose Insert | Header&Footer and put checks next to the items you want on the slide.
MS changed the way headers/footers/page numbers etc. work in PPT 2007; they're now treated as shapes on the slide where they appear, rather than as true master shapes. There are upsides and downsides to this.  I suspect you're stuck on the downside.
