It looks like the problem was actually caused by Netcat itself.  Initially, the 3G modem was misconfigured, which is why I fired up Netcat in the first place.  I found out that, even though UDP is connectionless, Netcat does some funky stuff to simulate being connected over UDP.  I won't claim to fully understand it, but somehow this was causing the data to not be delivered.  Eventually, I ended up just letting the 3G modem do its thing without netcat running, and it worked.  The data was delivered correctly.  As soon as I fired up netcat sending test data again, the data stopped being delivered.  Kill netcat, and it starts being delivered again.  Bizarre.
I would start by removing 3G from the equation. It sounds like you have already done this, and have found it to work. If so, the 3G service may be blocking the UDP traffic. Alternatively, the UDP packets may simply not be surviving, UDP is designed for high-throughput, low-availability. The volatile 3G network is precisely the environment that TCP was designed for and is sub-optimal for UDP applications.
