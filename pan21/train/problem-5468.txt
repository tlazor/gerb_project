I got two HGST 4TB HDD's for my birthday and I'm trying to put them in my media center which already has a 128GB SSD and a 2TB HDD. The motherboard is an ASRoxk E350M1 which only has 4 SATA headers so I'm unplugging my DVD-ROM while I test and load the new disks, and I'll be passing my 2TB drive along to my wife.
Now, I'm going to be taking a drive out, so I can do the Tower of Hanoi shuffle and get everything the way I wanted, but does anyone have any ideas what could cause this?
The problem is, with all four hard drives plugged in, Ubuntu never boots. I get the BIOS, which recognizes all four drives and selects the right one as the boot drive, but GRUB never loads. I have tried several different configurations of ports, cables and drives, and it will boot with any three drives (provided one is the SSD with the boot partition). It will even boot with any three drives and the DVD-ROM, so it is not any one drive, and it is not any SATA port or power cable, but specifically the combination of all four drives.
