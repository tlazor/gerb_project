I want to get either the USB ports or the wireless chipset working, but what should I install for this particular computer? Once I get connected to the Internet I am hoping everything will be easier.
You may try to find drivers for older versions of Windows by searching on the website of each component maker.
I installed Windows 7 on it, however almost nothing works, including usb ports, wifi chip etc.. Therefore I have no Internet connection and Windows 7 can not update itself.
The trick to getting any driver for any laptop is to check on the official site what specific components it has, under any version of OS the manufacturer is providing drivers for. Then you just search for that component driver for the OS version you need.
I boot with a ubuntu usb and connect to the Internet and I can download drivers and copy it to the harddrive where Windows 7 is installed. 
You should find drivers at manufacturer's website for your laptop's model. You should install following drivers in this order
So what drivers should I download for this computer to get wifi or usb ports working with Windows 7?
