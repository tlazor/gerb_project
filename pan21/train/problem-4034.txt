I am not able to SSH to Raspberry Pi 3 from Putty. I can ping the 192.168.137.1 IP address assigned by sharing Internet connection. Note: I do not have HDMI monitor so need to access remotely only. 
If you use Windows the boot partition will be mounted as soon as you plug in the SD card. Open any editor you are familiar with on Windows and create a file called 'ssh' and save it.
The problem I realized that SSH is not enabled by default in Pi3 and saw the posts which suggest to enable SSH by creating 'ssh' file inside /boot folder. I got the SD card which has pre-installed Noobs so when I open SD card it shows only /recovery folder. How to enable SSH in this case ? Please help to resolve it .
Even if i get monitor which supports HDMI, it seems i need to edit the display settings to adjust the screen resoltuion to 1920 *1080 by changing /boot/config.txt file. But i can not see boot folder in SD card. Please help to resolve this.
If you can somehow get the display up and running, you can enable SSH from raspi-config. For me the 'ssh' file in /boot partition didn't work. But I'll give you a walkthrough anyway, since I saw some false info in your post.
