It would be better to use a regex to match the string and extract the relevant parts using capture groups, for example:
It's standard style to use PascalCase for classes and methods; camelCase for variables and arguments. At no time should there be underscores in your names. It's not a big deal if you will be the only developer to ever touch the code, but if you work on a team or expect to open source the code, it will be important to code in a style that other C# devs expect. For more information, please see The Official Microsoft C# Style Guide.
From your code snippet I assume that it's part of a Winforms form. This indicates somewhat of a design problem as it's violating the Single Responsibility Principle and your representation of the information (winforms controls) are very tightly coupled to the serialization which in total will it make hard to unit test properly.
Ideally you would inject the serializer into the class so you can mock it out for unit testing (in which case providing an interface for it will make mocking easier).
