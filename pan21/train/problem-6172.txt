Apache now needs to find out from which virtual host it will service the response. It does this by looking at the IP:Port pair, and if a NamevirtualHost statement exists for the IP:Port pair it also looks at the host: header. The important thing to be aware of here is that if you call up a site by IP, the host:header will contain the IP address, not the name of the host. You need to use names (and they need to correctly resolve to the correct ip). 
When a browser sends a request for 192.168.1.100:8081 what it does is connecting to 192.168.1.100. port 8081 and subsequently it will send a http request. This looks (simplified) a bit like this:
What you need to stop doing here is confusing apache by mixing named based virtualhosts and port based virtualhosts. In other words, you need to remove the NameVirtualHostdirectives. You don't need them.
One last remark: If the aim is to block everyone but the server itself on the wamp directory you need to change something else on your config too:
If Apache can't find a virtualhost that matches the IP:Port:Host combination it defaults to the first VirtualHost section. And this is what is happening here. Just swap your two sections around and see what happens...
