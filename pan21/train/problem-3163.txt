If you want redundancy for your data and have two drives RAID-1 is really the only way to go, but you won't gain any additional storage space from that new drive you are putting in.
If you have M partitions on N physical drives, and N < M, that means that at least one drive will have two partitions. RAID-5 protects you against losing one of the partitions; if one of the drives —with at least two partitions used by the RAID-5 volume— fails, you instantly lose the RAID-5 volume.
The only protection that would give you would be against losing some sectors in one of the partitions; given all the levels of protection that automatically happen without you knowing (e.g. faulty sector remapping) and my experience so far, the gains from protecting against such a failure are very little compared to the space (and speed!) you've lost for as long as the RAID-5 volume existed.
best case scenario when everything is working you get a slower more complicated version of just creating a full sized partition on the second drive and using it as normal (you'll take a performance hit of having to write multiple times for every write operation, but won't gain any protection from failures if multiple partitions are on the same disk!)
If you have only two drives, but you are spreading three (or more) volumes worth of parity data across them, when a drive dies then you are going to lose some of the parity data needed to rebuild the volume(s) that were on that drive.
