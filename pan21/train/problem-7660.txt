Where you are likely to run into trouble are with the drivers. Many older devices simply don't have Windows 7 or 8 drivers, although sometimes the Vista driver may work. This is the case with my XP laptop, where the ATI X1400 GPU doesn't have any official drivers, and the Vista drivers are wonky.
I've managed to use Windows XP with Office 97 on Pentium II computer with 128 MB RAM. It's everything but imaginable with Windows 7.
But if you still want to stick to Windows OS, then you are going have to upgrade to something a heck of a lot better performance wise.
Windows 7/8 is better choice for new computers, having >= 8 GB RAM, >= 8 cores etc. But it's not your case.
The 50GB HD is small, but, depending on your needs, it should be enough. My C:\Windows currently uses 11.8GB (Windows 8).
Assuming you can make those upgrades, the two OS's are very similar, 8 is actually slightly lighter / faster. If you are OK with the Modern GUI, that would probably be a marginally better choice.
The Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant will let you know about many problems: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/buy
If you really want to continue using your laptop, a linux release might just work for this type of hardware.
Go the microsoft site and checkout the MINIMUM hardware requirements for Win 7 and Win 8.  I believe you are going to find that 1G of memory is insufficient for either.  Also 1.66 GHz processor will be pretty slow.
Strictly speaking your computer falls within the minimum requirements for both Windows 7 and 8, so either should work, but Windows 8 has seen a number of performance improvements that would make it the better choice.
From my experience and the opinion of numerous people I know Window 7 is much slower than Windows XP.
