I've used DebugMode Wink on Windows before for screencasting. They also have a linux version. I haven't tried it, but if it's like the windows version, it should be pretty easy to use, and is pretty flexible. It outputs to SWF or a series of PNGs.
Any-Key is a small tool made to simplify screencasting. Whenever you press a key combination or click the different mouse buttons Any-Key will display it in its window. This makes it possible to easily show complicated key combinations while recording. Of Course it is also possible to disable it with the so called "toogle-key" which will toggle between on and off.
It's important to show the actions like mouse click, mouse right click, and all what's coming out from the keyboard. In the similar way to this video http://www.flickr.com/photos/jannis/3246408003/ which is made using OSX and ScreenFlick www.araelium.com/screenflick/
Full disclosure: I was involved in designing it back in the day and it hasn't really been updated in a while. But it still works on my kubuntu 13.04 and I use it regularly.
I know it's not quite in the spirit of what you are doing but I have done Ubuntu tutorials by running Ubuntu in a Parallels on my Mac.  On the Mac I run Jing (free) and publish the flash file (.swf) to a website.  Jing works on Windows too...
