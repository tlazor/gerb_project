I've also thought to just put these larger disks in another free poweredge 1950 I have laying around and then move the data from the existing server over to this server. I have been experimenting with this offline, however I'm not sure this is the best way to go about it? The method I was going to go about this was
If all went well with the above I'd have a duplicate server with larger drives, and if that didn't work I'd still have the old server with smaller disks to revert back to in emergency.
I've experimented with some computers laying around my house, I got as far as having the new destination boot up but because of different hardware the destination server kernel panics, appears to be a missing kernel module for the hard drive controller. I was going to look into resolving this and seeing if my little experiment works so I can replicate on the live server, however I was wondering if I am going about this the wrong way?
I have a centos server that runs a whm/cpanel with mysql, apache, bind and email daemons. The server now has 95% of the server disk full. It is a dell poweredge 1950 with 2 spaces for SAS disks. I have it setup now with mirrored raid with the two disks currently in the server ( SAS 146GB 10K drives ).
I need to get more space available on the server but I'm unsure about how to go about that. What would you guys suggest for getting more space? I have purchased two 600GB SAS 10k drives to replace the 146GB drives ( i want to run the new larger drives in mirrored configuration as well ).
I've thought about trying to pull one of the disks in the mirrored configuration and putting a larger disk in and letting the system try to rebuild the array. However I'm worried that this could cause problems and that the larger disk may not even be accepted into the array. If the raid array became corrupted or unusable, then I'd be stuck doing a bare metal restore from backups which I'd like to avoid like the plague.
