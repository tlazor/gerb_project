Thankfully I was able to discover the interface show below, which contains the "Show/Hide Paragraph" option.
Ctrl + Enter does send in Outlook. I discovered this when I wanted to cut-paste, then press enter multiple times. Ctrl+V , Enter easily became Ctrl+V, Ctrl+Enter when I did not release the Ctrl key fast enough. 
I would attempt to indent one line of text, and whole swathes of text would go with it. I created an example below:
Modern solutions cause modern problems - Due to other chat programs (work and home) I have become used to adding new lines via Shift + Enter instead of paragraph marks using only Enter. The error occured due to (understandable) user error since Word/Outlook are one of the few programs left that I use that don't send on Enter. 
Once enabled, I was able to immediately see the cause of my problem, and could infer my solution from the accepted answer: Replace new lines with paragraphs. 
I would like to answer this because I had a similar problem, but I have no scripts running. I am an otherwise regular user.
