There are a couple of different options, ranging from "simple and a long shot" to "sure to work but tedious".
If you have the source code, grep it for the word socket. When you find it, the port will be around that line of code.
You say the network trace is huge. Have you tried to shut down all unnecessary programs and network communication first? A surefire way is to use a Virtual Machine to start the program. This makes it a lot easier for you to trace its activity, since it is limited to a specific IP.
I got a program called wireshark - but the data is just huge. Is there an alternative or way to filter data to get a good overview?
Well I get a "host was not accessible" error when trying to use a software. I don't know which port they use nor which address they are trying to reach. Is there a more or less easy way to figure that out?
If it's not in the documentation, you're going to have to sift through a Wireshark or Netmon dump. That being said, a quick call to the mystery application's support staff should resolve your problem. 
If it is really difficult for you to find the correct network activity, attach a debugger and do a trace on the program. You can filter out calls to well-known application libraries like WinSock, or even set a breakpoint on when the "host was not accessible" error dialog is shown. This is however very tedious and will require some reverse engineering voodoo.
