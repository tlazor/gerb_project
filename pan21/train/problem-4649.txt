I would load up a Linux live CD, as andrewktmeikle said above, or the gparted live CD, remove all the existing partitions, and partition the drive into two NTFS partitions, one of about 50Gb to install Windows on and one that's the rest of the drive to keep data on.  Get any data you need off the current Windows partition first, of course - plenty of advice for doing that with a Linux live CD here on SU.
I booted from the Win 7 DVD and went into Windows Recovery Mode.  Then I opened the cmd prompt.  From there I located and deleted the Windows folder within DOS.  The directory still existed on the hdd, but it couldn't be seen.  Then I was able to dismount and format the drive while still in the command prompt.  After that I restarted and reloaded with the Win 7 DVD and I was able to remount the partition and install Win 7.
It wouldn't allow me to make any changes to the partition that Windows was installed on.  I couldn't format or delete.  Literally had no options aside from installing Windows again and having the "old windows" folder created.  The issue seemed to be that despite booting from the Win 7 DVD, on some level the partition with Win 7 on it was being accessed and therefore wouldn't allow me to move forward.
The first partition there is Dell's recovery partition, which their techs might use on occasion.  If you're comfortable enough with computers to post on Superuser, you can safely delete it.  There's nothing there you need.
To be clear, I was having the same issue when trying to format and reinstall Win 7 Ultimate on the custom machine I built a couple of years ago.
I realize this post is a couple years old, though I figured it might help anyone trying to do research just as I was while encountering the same problem last night.
The only downside to doing it this way was it rearranged the labels of my existing D, E, and F drives.   Other than that, it worked perfectly.
