A /22 is a lot of IPv4 space.  You're not going to find many/any that will give you that large an allocation.  You'll probably have to go to your local internet registry (like APNIC) and justify/order your own range.  From there you can try and find a host that will advertise it for you.
We did not really need that many IPs, its just how they do things, all IPs are public. I can not imagine any legitimate need for that many IPs except you are planning to be an ISP yourself, but in that case it is better to get a real colo and arrange the links and ranges yourself, otherwise I don't believe you can be competitive enough to survive.
No matter how many public IPs you want you'll have to justify to the CoLo, who forwards the justification on to ICANN that you need that many IPs.  That's anywhere from 5 IPs on up.
Any hosting company should be willing to give you a /22 of space, as long as you can justify it.  I'll place a smallish wager that you won't be able to justify that much space, though.
Our current hoster NTT Europe Online gave us /24 public range without asking for any justification. We had to chop it up to VPSes ourselves though because they don't know anything except vmware, and they are not cheap, their managed hosting costs 4 times more that Rackspace's.
