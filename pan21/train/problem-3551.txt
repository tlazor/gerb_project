Now I'm looking for a solution to access my encrypted data again (e.g. forcing Windows to see it as an encrypted file).
I had a file that was encrypted using windows EFS on an NTFS filesystem. It was deleted accidentally and I had to recover it using a data recovery software. Unfortunately, recovered file isn't an encrypted one (although the file content is still encrypted).
You need to double-click the EFS certificate that you've backed up and import it into your current PC. It will prompt you to enter the original password. Once the password is validated, the certificate will be imported and your encrypted files will become readable.
I don't think you're going to be able to use Windows to natively restore access to this file since, as you mention, the current file isn't seen as encrypted by Windows.  I'm guessing you restored the raw file and will need a program that can decrypt a blob of data rather than trying to decrypt it through the NTFS file system.
I found this page that (while otherwise pretty terribly written) does offer the names of several third-party vendor solutions that might be able to help you recover the unencrypted contents.  I would start by looking into the ntfsdecrypt tool and the Elcomsoft tool.  They still might not operate on a low enough level to accomplish what you're hoping for, but seem like your best chance.
