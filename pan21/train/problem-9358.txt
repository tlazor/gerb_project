Actually I use the formula with linear and quadratic factors without gamma can mimic the glowing effects very well. Linear cannot. 
When using the openGL model to approximation a spherical light source all three coefficients make sense and are valid (not "to prevent overflows" or to have "artistical freedom"):
Imho this approximation is better than using infinitesimally small point lights with no extend at all!
by Thomas Engelhardt, Carsten Dachsbacher But unfortunately they don't have a final simple formula for light scattering. I guess maybe the final GPU imitation effect would be similar to the linear and quadratic formula.
The linear attenuation coefficient is the physical counterpart of light travelling into a medium. Without attenuation, light seems to travel in perfect void. When rendering "realistic" scenes, you want the air to attenuate the intensity of light over distance, and this attenuation is linear.

When we view a spot light, for example, actually we see the light scattering. So the formula of 1/d^2 is only for the emit light of that pixel. But the brightness in our camera of that pixel will have a more complicated formula, which will use light scattering theory. See the paper
