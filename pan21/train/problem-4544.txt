It sounds like you have a Group Policy Object (GPO) with the Folder Redirection for the Documents folder enabled. Run a Resultant Set of Policy against a user with whom you are seeing the problematic behavior and it will lead you in the direction of the GPO you need to modify.
In my haste I neglected to see that you say you did modify a GPO containing some Folder Redirection settings. Check the event logs on clients that are exhibiting problems to verify that the Folder Redirection Client Side Extension (CSE) isn't logging any errors. It may be that your modified GPO is having a problem applying and the setting is remaining as it was. The CSE's Event Log messages should give you some indication if the modified GPO is failing to apply.
In the RSoP have a look in the "Windows Settings" sub-node of the "User Configuration" sub-node. I suspect you'll find a Folder Redirection policy there applying to the "Documents" folder. Assuming you do, before you go modifying it you would do well to read-up on how the feature works so that you have a good idea of what's going to happen when you change it.
