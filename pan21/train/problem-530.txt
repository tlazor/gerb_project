As far as allowing only a single user to get in... you need to setup permissions (anonymous access will allow anyone in): http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/cf7f59d4-9ab9-4038-a482-d72d3e6f801e.mspx?mfr=true
I have a site running on IIS6 and I want to make it authenticate via the standard gray pop-up window. I.e. it should use Windows to authenticate. I want to make it so only one single user on the system can get in, not any user setup on the server. Its currently setup without anonymous access and with Integrated Windows Auth. Any user on the system can use their credentials to log in. How do I make it so only a single user can get it?
That sounds like two different problems... If you want your users to authenticate with the pop-up window (rather than just using their Windows credentials through NTLM or Kerberos), you would need to setup Forms Based Authentication (FBA) through ASP.Net (more information here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480476.aspx)
