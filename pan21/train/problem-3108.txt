edit: just wanted to add, if you keep giving temp access out- it's going to annoy your repeat business. It's just as easy to setup perm accounts for them to use :)
We have used CrsuhFTP running on a spare Windows box.  It can use many formats(SFTP,FTP,HTTPS,SCP, WEBDAV and others)  but the fact that clients can send/download from a web browser is a big deal for us.  And it is secure using SSL.  You can have many accounts and it alerts on transfer if so configured.  There is a free trial and support is great.  Cost is reasonable.  Setup is simple. Accounts and content can be set to expire.

I would create a different account for each client, locking them to their own directory. There is no way you want clients to see each other's work!
If you choose to stick with FTP, please switch to something better, then with some FTP daemons you can setup permission such that a user will not be able to see files that are uploaded.  For example see the section 'common configuration: an upload-only directory' in the proftpd mini-HOWTO.  So the simple answer may be to find a ftp daemon that can support upload only feature.  Here is a blind drop howto for IIS.
As for a client, FileZilla, I know... not the simplest but if they can learn Office they can learn drag and drop.
