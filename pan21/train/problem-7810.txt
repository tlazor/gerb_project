I am new to Amazon Glacier. I have succesfully created a vault and uploaded some archives.  In the management console I can only see the name of the vault and that it contains 4 archives, taking up 4.2 GiB. But I simply can't find a way to list the archives in the vault.

The key is to use the InitiateJob API function with Type set to inventory-retrieval. The following code will need to be modified to suit your particular case.

I have looked and googled for more than an hour but still I can see no way of listing the content of a vault.
