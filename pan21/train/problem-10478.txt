This worked, and I'm able to login to the web application using NTLM.  Now this application would be used by all of my client machines... so I'm wondering what the security risks are if I was push this policy out to all of them (not to the domain controller itself though)?
As Adam and sysadmin stated, this is a very bad idea from a security perspective (not to mention from a legacy perspective as it was replaced in the NT 4 days and NTLMv1 could potentially be removed from future versions of Windows).  What about using Kerberos for authentication/SSO?  It is more secure than even NTLM v2, works in double-hop scenarios, and will be supported (both inside and outside of Microsoft) for the forseeable future.
I have a web application that I'd like to authenticate to using pass-through NTLM for SSO.  There is a problem, however, in that NTLMv2 apparently will not work in this scenario (without the application storing an identical password hash).
Yes, there are increased security risks by doing this. Whether or not they matter to you is up for your own risk assessment.
I enabled NTLMv1 on one client machine (Vista) using its local group policy: Computer->Windows Settings->Security Settings->Network Security: LAN Manager authentication level.  I changed it to Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated.
It's a really bad practice, kinda like enabling WEP to protect your WiFi because you have a Windows 98 computer that won't work with WPA2. It's 2009, Kerberos works if you really, really need SSO.
NTLM was replaced by NTLMv2 in NT4.0 SP4. That's over a decade ago. NTLM is harder than LM to crack for passwords, and NTLMv2 is much harder. There is a reason Vista defaults to NTLMv2 only. Rainbow tables have been compiled for the complete LM password space, and last I heard work was well in progress to do the same for the NTLM space. NTLMv2 hasn't been done yet. 
I also consider integrated authentication for websites to be a bad practice in general as it often leads to oddball issues when users have multiple accounts (we use separate user/admin accounts), requires you to muck around with IE trust zones, and requires you to use IE or fiddle with Firefox settings.
Given the trainwreck that IE has been and continues to be since 2002 or whenever IE6 came out, (ie. The out of band ActiveX patch) do you really want to commit to the platform?
