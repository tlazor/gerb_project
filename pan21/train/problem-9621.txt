You can use a program like Strings to examine the text contained in the crash dump (this particular one can extract both ASCII and Unicode text).
You can also use Nirsoft’s BlueScreenView to examine the decoded contents of the crash dump files. You’ll need to either save the dump to the default mini-dump folder (%SystemRoot%\MiniDump), or else tell BlueScreenView where to find your Chrome dumps in the advanced options (Ctrl+O):
Then use a proper session-management extension like Session Buddy. That way, you can control every aspect of your session, including removing items from a saved session.
Those files have no bearing on the profile itself and only include a list of the open tabs and windows, and the contents of the web forms you have open. Chrome will be able to use any session/tab files, including those from a different profile (at least from the same version).
Instead of going through the built-in bug-reporting mechanism, try filing a bug report instead, and then let them tell you what they want or need. You may find out that they don’t need your files at all.
