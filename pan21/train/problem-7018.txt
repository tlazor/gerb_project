Based on many of the IPv6 protocols, you should really only use /64 networks, except for point-to-point networks (/127) and loopbacks (/128). Using networks of other sizes breaks some things in IPv6. See RFC 5375, IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment Considerations, Appendix B. Considerations for Subnet Prefixes Different than /64 and RFC 7421, Analysis of the 64-bit Boundary in IPv6 Addressing among other sources.
A router is just a host on a network that knows how to communicate with other networks. A host needs to have a gateway (router) on its network to be able to communicate with devices on a different network.
Yes, you can connect routers with only link-local addresses, but that really complicates support and troubleshooting. For example, you cannot ping a router interface that only has a link-local address from a different network.
Link-local addresses are still IP addresses. IPv6 allows, even requires, multiple IP networks on a single interface. A router could be on any or all of those networks.
