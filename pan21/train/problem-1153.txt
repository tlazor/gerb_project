Another choice would be to use a program like Ghost to create an image of the partition and then install that image on the new drive.  Once the image is installed, you could do a full recovery and reinstall.
The last option would be to contact Dell for a set of discs for the computer. Normally the vendor charges for this option.  Your results may vary.
Davids post is a good one, however it will not create the restore partition the same way Dell had it, it will not have any of the special drivers or pre-installed Software that came with your Dell system, but is still a good idea.
You need to find the Windows 7 installation disc if you have one. Boot your computer to the installation disc. Start the installation. Once you get to the step where it asks which partition you would like to install Windows on, create a second partition (This will be the recovery partition). Once Windows is fully installed set the second partition as the recovery partition. More information on creating the recovery partition can be found here.
Is the original drive still operational?  Some vendors place utilities on them which allows the owner to burn a copy of the recovery partition to a DVD or multiple discs in the case that the hard drive malfunctions.  You should check the original drive for this type of utility or check Dell's support site for the utility.
