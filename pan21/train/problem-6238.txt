If you want to continue using the old box as well, you need to create (and restore afterward) a complete image backup of the old harddrive.
Even though you have two live machines, you will likely want to store the migration data as a file, instead of doing a live transfer. This also gives you a nice point-in-time .MIG backup file.
Windows Easy Transfer is actually a wrapper for USMT functions, but the full USMT toolkit is more full featured, and it is included in the Windows 8.1 ADK, currently at version 5.0.

from an old windows 8.1 box to a new one. Basically replicate the awesome Mac OS migration assistant, but for Windows 8.1.
I have not tried this exact procedure, but I have exprience with similar hacks. Windows 8 usually recovers quite well from these shenanigans.
