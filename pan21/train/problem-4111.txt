Could you send the mail from your phone?  Most Mobile (Cell) phones can send email now if correctly set up?
You can use Google Calendar as a work around. Create a Google calendar event and add a reminder be sent to you by email with the subject or comments listing whatever info you need that will remind you to send the note from your drafts folder or whatever. I agree that it would be nice to have this feature in Gmail. 
If you have Outlook 2007 available create a new mail and click on the Options tab. There should be a button in the More Options group called Delay Delivery. Clicking that will allows you to choose when your mail is sent. Outlook has to be running at your selected time, so don't just close it and forget about it! This option may be available in earlier versions, but I don't have them installed so I can't check to see where they are
If all else fails there is always the manual way - write the email, save it in your drafts, and then when it's time to send it, manually do so.
If you must use a web-based program, you can use something like FutureMail, though I would test them first to make sure you're not going to be sending ad-filled email which looks like it's being sent from a strange email address.
If you don't have access to Outlook, Thunderbird can do this, just go to File > Send Later (or press Ctrl + Shift + Enter)
