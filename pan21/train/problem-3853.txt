The only serious hurdle to overcome here, before Valve made changes to attempt to address this, was that you needed to get your games on Steam in the first place. But once you'd overcome that the first time it was much easier to generate a bunch of "asset flip" games to create a multiplicative factor on the amount of money one could "farm" this way.
Developers can generate an unlimited number of keys for their games. They can also create an unlimited number of throwaway Steam accounts, because Steam accounts are free to create. Accounts earn trading cards simply by running a given game for a specific period of time. In this fashion, an unscrupulous developer can generate an unlimited number of trading cards for all of their games by making throwaway accounts, generating keys for those accounts, and simply launching and idling in their games. Simple bots can accomplish this without much effort.
Developers get a small percentage of trading card sales, that's how they make money on trading cards. It doesn't matter that the money earned by the seller of the card is locked up in a given account's Steam Wallet, nor does it matter that you only get a fixed number of drops before needing to create booster packs, et cetera. Those mechanisms prevent a player from trivially generating an unlimited amount of money in their Steam wallet. They don't provide guard rails for developers looking to abuse the system.
Since the developer earns a small amount of money on every trading card sold, they can then sell off stock of their unlimited number of cards and take the profits. 
But this is, in fact, exactly what they did. Probably not intentionally, but they permitted it all the same:
