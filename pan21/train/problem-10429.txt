The first time this happened I thought it was just a coincidence. I have Spotify on my laptop but haven't used it in years. Yesterday I opened Spotify and within a few seconds, I noticed that my browser was no longer working. Strangely Skype continued to work but other programs such as Remote Desktop didn't work either. Initially I thought it was a problem with my laptop, but when I checked my Android device, I noticed that it too was no longer able to connect to the internet through the Wifi. Only after restarting the Wifi router was I able to reconnect to the internet.
Tonight this happened again after opening Spotify, so I'm quite confident that Spotify is the source of the problem. A Google search resulted in only this link, which was useless http://getsatisfaction.com/spotify/topics/spotify_kills_my_wireless_router_every_time
What can I do next time this happens, and how can I prevent it? I have to telephone another person to restart the router every time this happens, which is far from ideal for both of us.
