With logs getting captured in syslog-ng, I'd like to be able to automatically monitor the logs and receive an alert if NO log events appear that match a certain criteria. For instance, for a subscription-based website, if 6 hours elapse with no orders, then email or text this person or group of people.
What you could also do is to take a look at LogAnalyzer. Unfortunately, I don't remember if it is capable of sending emails. Nevertheless, it uses MySQL and stores the log info there. With LogAnalyzer setup, you would have two copies of your logs, as they go in parallel - one in syslog, one in the DB. If you have an user for this DB, capable of reading its contents, you could avoid running the above mentioned cron job. It may not be that much better but could add another protection layer. 
Nagios can do this for you with ease.  Personally, i like any thing that i can easily run on the commandline and/or set up easily via Nagios or Crontab.
The way I've approached this in the past is by forwarding syslog traffic to a database, and then just querying the database for the last received log message from a particular hostname, with it's timestamp. 
Basically, this command will alert as warning if at least 1 'orders submitted' entry is NOT found in the log file /prod/apps/mylogfile.  It will alert as critical if at least 2 'orders submitted' entries are not found in the log.
./logrobot autonda /prod/apps/mylogfile 60m 'orders submitted' '.'  1  2  subscription_orders -ndnotfoundn
I believe the easiest way to take care of this is by writing very simple script in language of your choice. You just need to grep through the syslog for a specific messages and send email if none found. Including some sanity checks I can't imagine more than 20 lines. Stick this is cron and you are all set. The drawback is that by using this method, the cron job has to run as root in order to read the logs.
