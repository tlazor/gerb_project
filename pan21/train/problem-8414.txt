(I suppose you are you talking about WPA? Wap: Wireless Application Protocol / WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access. The first refers to a standard for mobile phones accessing the net, the second is a crypto standard for WiFi)
This is commonly know as a MITM (Man in the middle) attack. (See for references : article, wikipedia MitM, wikipedia security of Wireless comms)
You could do it with a Laptop + a Fon router modified to run Jasager here is an article on it... http://www.hak5.org/w/index.php/Jasager
Eavesdropping is commonly countered by the use of secure connections such as SSL (HTTPS) and VPNs. (Provided you don't accept unverified certificates). 
I don't know how the 802.11 standards deals with multiple APs and what would be the behaviour of one connecting from a zone that is covered by both the legal and pirate AP.
Theoretically if you can get the WiFi password of the Access Point (by sniffing), you can broadcast the same WiFi network name (a.k.a. SSID) with a laptop. Thus anyone connecting to the WiFi broadcast by the pirate laptop would be going through its routing.
