Everything else that has been suggested, looking at MAC forwarding tables, wireless associations, etc. all require privileges, i.e. administrative control of the device, and some of them are still subject to pitfalls (AP to controller tunneling, unmanaged switches/hubs, etc.) that require you to have additional information about the network to reliably interpret you results.
Layer 2 discovery protocols (LLDP, CDP, etc.) for the most part only broadcast information about themselves to the network, so you would still need some level of administrative control to be able to see the received LLDP information at a given point in the network.
I think you best bet of walking into a completely uncontrolled environment and determining this would be sniffing the wireless communications, but you have ruled that out as well.
Without some level of administrative privilege, the short answer is that this is not possible with any degree of accuracy.
As you pointed out, using ping time and or packet loss is dubious at best.  You cannot account for where the latency/loss is being introduced, so it is at best a very shaky guess without having some knowledge of the network architecture.
