c1841-ipbasek9-mz.151-4.M5 and c1841-ipbasek9-mz.124-24.T5 on its flash and with ROM ver "Version 12.4(13r)T5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)" and those routers can recgonize the card succesfully so i just take the flash off from one of those routers and replace it with the flash of the router with the problem. i did some efforts as follows:
I have this problem where c1841 router unable to verify HWIC-1T card (with smart serial connector), you have to know that i have other routers with IOS
All 1's in the EEPROM looks unrecoverably bad, and from Cisco's website you're using code that should recognize that card.
If this is the exact same model card in the exact same model router with the exact same IOS as you have working other places, you could have a hardware issue.  
If other HWICs don't work either, do you have any other models that you could try in the new router to see if the slot is possibly bad?
6.I have entered boot system flash:c1841-ipbasek9-mz.151-4.M5.bin command for testing IOS c1841-ipbasek9-mz.151-4.M5.bin but you will not find it on configration file attached. 
2.I have upgraded IOS to c1841-ipbasek9-mz.151-4.M5.bin and c1841-ipbasek9-mz.124-24.T5.bin and still have the same problem.
Steal a module from another router that is known working.  Does it work okay in the new router?  If it does, probably an HWIC issue.
