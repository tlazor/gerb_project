I saved the .ics file on the desktop and tried to "open with" but found that "open with" doesn't give me the option to choose a random app or the calendar app but only Outlook, an assorted list of some applications including Notepad, and the Windows Store.
Looks like inconsistency in the contents of the ICS may be a major issue hence missing from Windows Callender App. 
I don't think the Windows Calendar app supports .ics import. I think the only way to do it is to import into calendar.live.com
However, I was able to import into Outlook 2007, then Save a fresh ICS then import to calendar.live.com
Windows 10 opens the attached .ics file with Outlook and proceeds to add it to one of the inactive calendars in there. I don't want to use Outlook (or any inactive calendars which don't sync).
I opened Windows 10 Calendar and the entry was there. it was actually there twice since the first click worked anyway, just no notification so I did not know it worked
 I then right clicked on the .ics file and I selected "open with": and then  Windows "Calendar" app from list. 
I tried to set a default for calendar in the Windows 10 "All settings" -> "Default apps" and found that no program is configured for "Calendar". When I try to configure one (the calendar app), it says it cannot find any suitable app on my PC and proceeds not to find a suitable app in the Store.
I had an attachment on an email which was labelled "not supported calendar message.ics" - I clicked on it anyway - nothing seemed to happen.
