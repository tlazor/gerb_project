Let's say the Pi draws 1 Amp at 5 Volts. That's 5 Watts draw. (Your Pi is probably a bit lower than that, but there's some inefficiencies in the various conversions, so this'll work for now.)
11 minutes at half load. Full load is 900 Watts, so that's 11 minutes at 450 Watts. (11 / 60) * 450 = 82.5 Wh. Still not large enough.
The UPS you chose doesn't list their exact times, so there's no way to calculate how long it will last under a given load. I'll run through the calculation for a couple different UPSs, so you can repeat it on one of your choice.
Now, let's approach this math from the other side: The Pi draws 5 Watts. If you want a full day, that's 24 * 5 = 120 Watt-Hours. We need to find a UPS that has at least 120 Wh of capacity.
OK, 28.53 Watt-Hours, 5 Watts. 28.53 Wh / 5 W = 5.7 Hours. The UPS I linked above should be able to power your Pi for around 5.7 hours. 
Also, one thing to keep in mind is that most UPSs are designed to keep a system running for a few minutes, not a full day. 5 Watts for the Pi is almost nothing, the internal circuitry of the UPS is probably taking that much as well, and we didn't account for that in our calculations, and as our runtimes get longer and longer, it'll throw our math off more and more, but this'll get you close. 
OK, so it can run for 10.7 minutes at 160 Watts. That means it has a capacity of (10.7 / 60) * 160 = 28.53 Watt-Hours. (High draw applications will decrease the amount of time it'll last faster, because of how batteries work. Note that the "at full load" number isn't half the value of "at half load". Therefore, pick the statistic that's closest to our target draw, which is very small for the Pi.)
I'm going to use this UPS, which has a similar wattage rating as the one you chose: CyberPower EC650LCD ECO 650VA/390W.
As you search for UPSs, watch out for ones that claim a run time, but don't specify how much power is being drawn for that time. There's no way to tell how they came up with that number, and there's no way to do the math to figure out what the capacity is. With the one you linked, the front of the box says "10-30 minutes", but there's no way to tell what the wattage of that is, so we can't use that number in our calculations.
32 minutes at half load. Full load is 700 Watts, so that's 32 minutes at 350 Watts. (32 / 60) * 350 = 186.67 Wh. OK, that'll keep you running for a full day!
