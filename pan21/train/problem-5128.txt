Browsing websites would be a big nuisance.  Especially highly interactive web 2.0 sites that almost require mouse input.
It's both possible and in many cases much more efficient than using a mouse.  Obviously there are exceptions: you mentioned gaming and graphics software as obvious examples.  Also, as pointed out by Force Flow, web browsing effectively requires a mouse.  But many other activities are both faster and physically easier with a keyboard; the main drawback is the need to remember the keystrokes required, whereas with the mouse you just point and shoot.  People who use computers for any kind of data entry inevitably toss the mouse aside once they learn how to do everything with the keyboard.  There's also a backlash against mice because of the additional strain caused by extended mousing (is that a word?)  I know as a developer that the more I stay away from the mouse, the better my right shoulder will feel at the end of the day.  Anyway, thankfully most operating systems will continue to have baked-in keyboard support for the foreseeable future, because it increases accessibility.
Pretty much anything can be done, although using a mouse is much, much easier.  Hotkeys definitely help.
If the problem is that you don't have room to operate a mouse, there are notebook, mini, or ultra-mini mice available.
It has been a while, but since you have all these brilliant WIndows gurus giving you half wrong answeres...
Everything in the operating system itself has a keyboard-only method (sometimes it means using the command line instead), but some applications don't follow through with this as well.
There is a mode called MouseKeys-- google it. You can check it out via Control Panel-Accesibitiy. What it does is when you press some weird key sequence -- something like CTL-ALT-Num Lock. Then you will be able to use the numeric keypad to act as the mouse.
