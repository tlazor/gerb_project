I've created a new attribute ("HireDate") on the user object in the Active Directory Schema, per this article. It shows up in the list of editable attributes when I go to edit someone's AD profile. So far so good. 
I know that custom attributes can be created directly in SharePoint, but for other reasons I need to create the attribute in our local, on premises AD instance. 
You can use directory extensions to extend the schema in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with your own attributes from on-premises Active Directory. 
Now I would like to include that attribute along with the other profile information that gets synced to our Azure AD, using the Azure Synchronization Service Manager. 
I know how to include built-in attributes that are not synced by default (ex, here), but haven't found a way to do that with a custom attribute. 
Select the attribute what you want to sync in the available attributes under the Directory extensions when you configure the AAD connect in the installation wizard.
