This problem must be related to the dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d. Whenever this Device Tree overlay is activated, Pi doesn't support console output anymore. However you can operate as before. You can even type username and password to login on any tty. Which you can confirm that you logged in and have a running shell by using w command. You can still start X on :0, then export DISPLAY=:0 variable and finanly by using xcompmgr -a to have hardware accelerated OpenGL support on that X screen.
It is related to DT overlay, because in usage of vc4 the simple frame buffer in startup gets disabled as i understand. That is why no kernel outputs are seen on startup. After vc4 taken place, system is failing to use vc4 for virtual console.
I am having problems using the experimental OpenGL driver on Pi2 and Pi3: The system boots up normally, then I will see about 10 seconds the login prompt on console. Then the screen goes blank. The system responds normally via SSH, but there are no errors, neither in dmesg, syslog or messages. When trying to start X, it outputs "no screens found". The Pi is connected to a 1080p monitor via HDMI. Has anyone had such issues? Is there a workaround?
