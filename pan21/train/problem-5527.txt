If the only abnormality is user CPU % and the system itself is operating correctly otherwise then you're likely dealing with a software bug and will have to revert to the authors for help - or change the way you're using it to avoid triggering whatever bug you've found. Just check that you're not dealing with your own bug - ie, you're calling it badly or in a loop or something of that nature. I've seen that a few times.
In summary, dig into memory, irq, swap etc and see if you can exclude those - I suggest atop for a quick comparison between normal behaviour & aberant behaviour and to highlight critical items.
(Missing some info like what system CPU % is when pegged vs user CPU %) but check what percentage of CPU is IRQ, just in case that leads somewhere.
Assuming the system CPU % is fairly high and it's not IRQ's, you might want to check memory. A handy tool for an overview is atop, it should tell you if something like page scans or page steals is causing it because you're under heavy memory pressure.
Because atop gives you quite a comprehensive overview of the machine state it's very handy in getting a handle on the overall state. It would help comparing atop on a properly operating system vs one that's misbehaving as well.
