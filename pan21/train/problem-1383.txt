It should also be noted that you aren't required to update your machine at all (I know several people who were convinced this was the case with Macs).  If you are happy with 10.6 you can continue to run it until the computer itself is rendered inoperable.
Every new OS, you have to pay for. So yes, you have to pay to get from 10.6 (Snow Leopard) to 10.7 (Lion).
If the update is freely available, it will show up in the list of available updates in the update program. I'm sorry, it's been a long time since I ran updates on a Mac and so do not know the name of the program. But whatever the Apple OS Update application is, that will show all free updates to your OS.
There have been no definitive announcements yet, but there are rumors (and strong indicators, like how Apple has been distributing the 10.7 betas to developers) that the 10.7 upgrade will be deliverable through the Mac App Store (not a small feat, given the extensive nature of the update).  There will still undoubtedly be hard copies sold in stores as well, but the idea of a media-less update is an interesting one.
Updating from 10.6 to 10.7 will cost you (last upgrade was $50ish I believe).  Updating from 10.6.6 to 10.6.7 will not cost you.
