where XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a 16-digit Hex number. You may find more than one directories with this pattern,  I would use the most recent modified one.
Also, For anyone who also encountered this issue and is wondering where to find the file "usb.inf". You can find a backup in the following directory: 
I would first request you to check if this USB mouse and keyboard is working on a different system(or other computer with win7) , if yes then check if the USB ports are working by connecting different USB devices. If the other USB devices are working fine then please update the Chipset drivers from the manufacturer's website and restart the system and check. If the issue still persistâ€™ s Click on start--type device manager--expand Universal Serial Bus controller and uninstall all the USB root hub's by right clicking on each of the USB root hub's. And restart the system and check if the issue is resolved.
From the start menu open 'Devices and Printers', right click your computer and select 'Device installation settings', then I normally select 'Install driver software from Windows Update if it is not found on my computer'.
It turns out my usb.inf-file has disappeared from c:\windows\inf. I had to copy one from an other machine. That did the trick. Now everything works again.
