Add TeamViewer program as a basic task in Task Scheduler. Task Scheduler can make a computer run a program even if the computer is locked by a password during startup. Just keep your account signed in always in TeamViewer then it will automatically run TeamViewer at startup even if your computer is locked by a password. You can download programs or apps like Shutdown Start Remote app that remotely startup or shutdown computers or even wake it up from sleep mode. From that way, you can enjoy yourself controlling your computer without even sitting in front of it again. Just make sure the computer is always plugged in to the outlet that supplies it electricity as there is no way to remotely switch the electricity on or off. I'm even using it right now in my own tablet. Hope that I've been a helped to you or maybe you have already figured this out. If that's the case, please don't reply any negative comments on my answer 'cause I'm a very optimistic person and I hate turning people down. Only positive comments are accepted and will be read. Thank you!
If this doesn't fix your problem, try uninstalling this two hotfixes, restart, download and reinstall them again.
If all this fails, manually replace the rdpcorekmts.dll file with the correct version (6.1.7601.17767 for 2008 R2 SP1).
