Since the Exchange server is already a domain controller and they say, "Demoting a domain controller to a member server isn’t supported," this question is pretty much academic.
Please be kind in your response I'm no expert. I just want to know if it's a bad idea or good idea for my Server 2012 server that has Exchange 2013 to also be a domain controller.
Normally the best practice is to seggregate different type of roles to different servers so a particular server does not plays many roles, or just avoid a problem with a particular service ends affecting other services running in the server.
We currently have 3 servers that are configured as domain controllers (one of them is the exchange server in question). Is it better to have 2 or 3 domain controllers? We have about 90 workstations on the domain.
But then it also plays your budget and your size, sometimes not justifying the extra budget for more servers, so in this situations it's ok to have more than one role in a server.
I'm just wondering if it's better to have more or less. The more you have the more replication that needs to be happening so I'm thinking having the mail server have more roles may be a bad idea.
I can personally vouch for "System shutdown will take considerably longer if Exchange services aren’t stopped before shutting down or restarting the server."  In an SBS-style all-in-one environment with no backup domain controller, it can take an hour for the server to shut down while Exchange tries to contact a domain controller (which shut down before Exchange).  ("Bueller... Bueller... Bueller... Bueller...")
Pretty much what alphamikevictor said.  I just wanted to add that Microsoft has contradictory information out in this regard, or did.  Their Small Business Server (RIP) offering provided an all-in-one domain controller/Exchange/SharePoint server, but aside from that they say:
