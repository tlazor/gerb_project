There is no way to do that without editing source code. See the following blog post for an idea of how to do it
I'm running a small apache2 web server, and I'm trying to figure out how to make a customized message for the servertokens, so when somebody does a banner grab, it returns something like "No information for you!". Does anybody know how to do this?
I would hesitate to suggest you install a module to do just that one thing, but since you mention you want to prevent offsite image linking some of the other features mod_security has to offer might be attractive to you.
I am no longer running apache, but when I was I used a module called Mod_security for various things.  One thing it could do is allow you to set a custom ServerSignature as you are asking to do here.
ServerTokens Prod is essentially that, since "Apache" isn't particularly revealing (and you might as well throw in a ServerSignature Off to hide info on error pages, if you haven't already).  Is it insufficient in some way?
I can say that from experience mod_security is, in my opinion, a must-have for most public facing linux webservers running Apache.
