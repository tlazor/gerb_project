Does this laptop have a special "lenovo" utility? This could be something like a hotkey driver or a system device manager. Since the monitor works without the driver I believe it is a configuration somewhere that is preventing the display from showing properly. If the Intel driver utility is installed, you can open up the display manager from the system tray and change the configuration of the displays.
You could also try removing then reinstalling the display driver. Might wipe out the setting if the uninstaller cleans everything correctly.
It might be worth uninstalling anything display related first to remove any special settings that might persist.
I'd give installing the drivers another try. Go to http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page? and select your model, and find Video in the list. You should be able to see the Intel GM45 Display Drivers there.
Assuming no esoteric Windows issues are present, that should fix the problem. My guess is that whomever repaired your laptop somehow removed the display file (that would explain why the external monitor but not the laptop screen worked) and forgot to reinstall it.
Maybe it is stuck in projection only display mode. Most laptops have a button combination to cycle through these options and one is to only use external monitor. According to the user manual it is the Fn+f7 key. Try cycling that with the display driver enabled and the computer turned on.
