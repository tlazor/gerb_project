Depending on the file system, this process can be very slick.  However, it's not a backup in the sense that if the drive fails, you'll still lose your data.  The data still must be copied off to another source to be protected.
For example, let's say you have a file called, "ServerFault.doc" and it takes up blocks A, B, and C on the hard drive.  When you take a snapshot, Snap.0 (my name for the first snapshot) points at blocks A, B, and C.  It simply makes a copy of the pointer, but not the data.
Now let's say you alter the file.  When you save the file, instead of overwriting those existing blocks, the newly altered "ServerFault.doc" takes up blocks A, B, and D (presuming block D contains the changes to the file) and now your file pointer points to A, B, and D (leaving C unaltered).   If you take another snapshot, Snap.1 now points to A, B, and D.  If you "restore" Snap.0, it simply changes to the pointer to look at those blocks.
Snapshots aren't really backups per se.  They're simply using pointers to point to another set of blocks on the drive.
