So my question is: how concerned should I be about the mobile game getting hacked for the purpose of acquiring these unlocks without going through the correct methods? Is it so easy that your average user could do it, like they could for Diablo II, having the potential to significantly damage the game’s bottom-line? Or is it difficult such that only a small percentage of people who are interested enough would bother to try, so I can focus on providing the best UX for all players without worrying about these hackers?
Now I’m making a mobile TD using Unity, targeting the iOS, Android, and perhaps PC/Mac/Linux platforms initially. Players would slowly earn some rare currency during play that can be used for permanently unlocking exciting (but non-essential) extras, or they can just pay for them.
I used to play Diablo II, both online and offline. The game was so easily “hackable” offline that one could download a program called Hero Editor and, using a nice, comfortable interface, change their character in many ways. However, it was harder to hack the online portion of the game, and many that did were caught. Thus some of the game’s content was restricted to online play, doubling up as a way to promote people playing together.
I’m concerned that if I allow this gradual unlocking to happen offline (without a server to confirm the accrual of said currency), then it’ll be as easily hacked as Diablo II’s offline mode and that many people would simply resort to doing that instead of either playing it through or paying for it. However, I’m also reluctant to force online play, as the mobile environment has significantly lower network stability and this is a relatively long game to be playing in such conditions, so drop-out is very likely.
