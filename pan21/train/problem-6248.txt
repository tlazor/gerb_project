I am using Thunderbird 15.0.1 on two different Windows computers (Vista and Win 7). I maintain the email list for a local club, and often need to send out emails to all members from my home and office Pc's. 
Add-on that syncs the contacts to local or online directories. Syncs the photos, but not the groups (because the contacts are exported as .vcf cards)
Similar to Thundersync, except that the address books are synced in the native thunderbird format - i.e. .mab. The groups are therefore synced. Photos are not (to my knowledge).
You can use a online sync service - like DropBox, SpiderOak, etc - to sync the address books with the help of symbolic links. To do so, copy the address books you want to sync to your synced folder, and create a symbolic link to your profile folder.
I use a Thunderbird Address Book to maintain a list of club members and would like any changes made to that list to synchronise to both machines. Can anyone recommend a good way of doing this? I've found a couple of extensions that claim to do this, but both seem to have review that suggest they no longer function correctly since they are quite old extensions.
