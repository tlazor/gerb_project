However, on the question of idle of AWS t2, this doesn't hold. It didn't hold for t1 either (due to "stolen" time), but even that doesn't explain t2 behavior. I've run into scenarios where idle time (as reported both by Linux top and by AWS CloudWatch) is way above the documented threshold levels, yet the instance is losing CPU credits instead of gaining them. I believe this to be an accounting error on Amazon's side, and until it is fixed, trying too hard to understand how CPU utilization and idle are defined will be a waste of time..
I Googled out and found good explanation on some blog http://themindtracks.com/amazon-launches-new-low-cost-ec2-instances-burstable-performance/
"idle" is notoriously hard to define in general for Linux servers. On general level, idle should be any time not spent on user-mode, system-mode, low priority mode, i/o waiting or interrupts -- with the special provision that given the right kind of workload, i/o wait time could be converted to user-mode time (for another process).
I've posted some illustrative charts on AWS's support forums, where hopefully they will respond. https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=568026#568026
If you are using micro instance that runs on max 10% single core throughout. suppose times come when your server is consuming 5% of single core, so it consider remaining 5% of computing power as idle. This 5% keeps on accumulate off-course for 24hrs only. Now if you have this accumulation and mean while your server is starving for computing power than it can borrow from this accumulated computing power. For this computing power they  have used a fancy word called CPU Credits.
