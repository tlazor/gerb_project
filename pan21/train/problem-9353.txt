The simpler solution is to just not let your touch zones overlap. Instead of reacting immediately to the "touch begin" event on the full screen zone, check to see if the coordinates of the touch overlap any other touchables. If they do, then this isn't an event that your full screen zone should respond to.
But that's not all. When player is touching any part of screen (except of the above objects) main character must start fighting. The problem is in that I cant correctly handle all touch events on these game objects. When the player is touching to the joystick the main character starts moving but before this he is performing a single fight action. Can anyone give me some ideas how to correctly handle touch events on different gameobjects? Perhaps my question is confusing, I am sorry for this.
If your touchables overlap, what you are "touching" is ambiguous unless you process the input by the z-order or user-defined precedence of the touchables (Code Clown's solution). You would have to handle this ordering of touch event receivers in a higher level of your code so that the touch event can be stopped by the first receiver in the hierarchy.
