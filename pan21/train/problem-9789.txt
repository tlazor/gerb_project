I am a super-admin for my organization and I would like to download all Google Drive files for every user in my organization in order to have an offline copy of all information. These files may or may not be shared with me. It's okay if this is a manual operation, however it would be better if it could be automated. I do not want to go the route of having to have all documents shared with me so I can see all of the docs. I would rather just download all files in sub folders based on the users in my organization.
I've taken a look at Google Takeout but that needs to be done user by user. I've looked at Backupify, but that creates a backup, not a copy of the files I can download. I've looked at DriveExport, but that requires a Google Cloud Platform account which I do not have. Are there any other solutions?
Edit: Not sure how you plan on accessing other people's stuff without their permission? You'll need to get sharing privileges/permission from the users. You won't be able to just download people's stuff without consent. You should have that access since you're a super-admin, though. 
You can download entire directories as a compressed .zip on Google Drive, as long as it's shared with you.
