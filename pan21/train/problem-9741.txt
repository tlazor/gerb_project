I write to you about something that happened about 15 years ago.  And while I spoke to one person who confirmed the possibility, I remain hopeful for a better explanation.
About 15 years ago, I bought a 4 port netgear router and setup a dedicated Quake 3 server on a spare computer.  (Pentium 3's were slow and everyone had more than one back then.  hehe.)  After some initial difficulty, I was able to get things running but not in the normal way.   I was getting the default port initially but I believe NAT translation altered the port to something else.  I would sometimes get a negative port number.
It wasn't easy finding out how to connect to my own server except through LAN and as the weeks went by I slowly learned more and I write with confidence the events that transpired.  I learned how to connect directly to the server adding parameters to the shortcut icon but only if the port number was less than 5 digits. The negative (-) in front takes up a space on the 5 total digits and if the port was 5 digits the negative sign made it six and the last number was both visible but unusable.  It would not appear on the in-game server list during those times and I think I remember teaching the fellas how to connect directly.
If the question is too broad, then more specifically, assuming that my words are true (they are), I would think the 20 of us that played back then aren't the only ones that know of this.  The questions that come next for me are was it a bug that got fixed?  or a tech that is not in use?
