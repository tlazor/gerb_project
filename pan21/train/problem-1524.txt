I have a VM in AWS. I has two ethernet interfaces, which have different security groups applied to them. One of those security groups white-lists all sorts of machine addresses in my domain. When resolving the machine's fully-qualified domain name, I want the interface with the domain-friendly security to be resolved, however at present it's the other interface that's being resolved.
Resolving is done by DNS. DNS services are provided by a server which has an IP address.  If your Windows machine is multi-homed and has multiple possible paths to that one IP address, something is wrong, not ?!   Or is this an AWS thing ? (no experience with that)
When enumerating the ethernet interfaces using netsh interface ipv4 show interfaces, the unfriendly interface happens to be listed first in order of Idx:
Maybe it's me, but I've been 20 years in IT/Windows, and I don't get your question...    It has 2 different interfaces, which have different security groups applied?  Whitelist some machine addresses ?
In Network Connections press alt to get the tool bar to come up / select advanced / reorder the adapters to the one you want listed first
Based on the absence of better information, I might guess that Windows is just picking the first ipv4 interface it finds in this list when being asked to resolve the machine name. Is this the case? If so, is it possible to reorder this list? I poked around in the netsh help info but I couldn't find anything.
Network connections / properties of the adapter you don't want registered in DNS / TCP/IP4 / advanced / DNS tab / uncheck the option to register this connections address in DNS
