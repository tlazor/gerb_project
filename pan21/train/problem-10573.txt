I've searched this site and google, and I CAN find information about how to back up Hyper-V virtual machines by using Windows Server Backup from the Hyper-V host in Windows Server 2008. You have to set up a registry key to enable the Hyper-V VSS writer, and then you can take online backups of your VMs.
I went ahead and scheduled a windows server backup for 9pm tomorrow. It said it would take 86 GB, which means it MUST be counting those VMs. But will this backup fail?
... but it said that it was not applicable to my operating system. So I am thinking either Windows Server 2008 R2 already has its VSS service for Hyper-V enabled, or it still needs to be enabled but the FixIt package doesn't feel comfortable operating on an OS that wasn't RTM at the time.
However, all the information I have found is about a year old, and none of it has been updated for Windows Server 2008 R2.
It appears that a Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V Host can back itself and all its Hyper-V machines up right out of the box. The shadow copy service appears capable without any additional help.
