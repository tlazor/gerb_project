When I'm on my Linux box however, I cannot get WLAN internet access while the WLAN interface on the AP shares the same subnet (255.255.0.0) as the LAN. 
I've tried setting up DNS for my linux machine as 8.8.8.8. It can still ping the AP when sharing the same subnet at 169.254.2.1.
For instance, I cannot connect to the internet when both share the IP address space 169.254.x.x but I can get connectivity through this setup:
Conclusion: scratch out your experiment result as irrelevant, get a DHCP server or use static IPs. Your design, which made your DHCP disabled is completely wrong.
I'm using an access point that provides LAN as well as WLAN capabilities using 4G to connect its hosts to the internet. DHCP is deactivated by design. Regardless of the OS connected, I can ping across WLAN -> LAN, LAN -> LAN and whatnot. Windows PC's are not affected of this and connect to the internet just fine leading me to believe it is within the settings of my Linux box I need to look.
The combination of your environment and mess in your head is too complex to give a straight answer. First of all, 169.254/16 is Windows autoconfiguration prefix that is used when no DHCP server is reachable and Windows IP stack is configured to use DHCP. Linux by default doesn't have this feature enabled, so that's why you cannot get the outer world connectivity. Second, clearly there's a static subnet configured on your AP, and it's 192.168.1.0/24 - seems like access point default settings are in effect.
