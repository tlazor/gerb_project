With the above a subject DN ending with OU=ITS,O=My Org will be mapped to an LDAP entry with object class pkiUser with the client cert's subject DN stored in attribute seeAlso like this:
First of all you should not use an IP address in LDAP URL for provider=. Rather get a correctly issued TLS server cert for the hostname and then OpenLDAP slapd will conduct the correct TLS hostname check to prevent MITM attacks (see RFC 6125).
In case of TLS client certs the resulting authentication identity (authc-DN) is the subject DN in the client certificate. You might want to map that to an authorization identity (authz-DN) of an existing LDAP entry. This can be achieved by adding olcAuthzRegexp to cn=config like this:
You can then properly authorize this service user entry, in the above example via LDAP group ae-replicas.
I assume that you have TLS configured on your provider and consumer instances. The above syncrepl configuration uses the already configured TLS server certificate also as TLS client certificate for replication.
