My bet would be on hard disk physical, firmware or driver issues. Clone one of them on to a different brand hard disk and see if it makes a difference. 
Does it only happen when you open up a folder that forces the hard drive to be read? I've had problems with users who have a disconnected network drive on their computer, and Windows will keep trying to find the drive and the computer pretty much stops. I'm sure that's not the solution to your problem, but I wonder if it could be something similar.....or simple. Your power settings don't have the hard drives going to sleep after a set amount of inactivity or something right? 
I would start with a clean windows build and see if the problem occurs; no apps, no antivirus, just the drivers required to run the laptop.  If it still happens, your problem is driver or hardware related, and you will have to start examining them, making sure all firmware is up to date.  If it doesn't occur then it's application related and you can start layering them on 1 at a time until the issue appears.
