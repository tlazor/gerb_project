Here is a very quick-and-dirty description of how DNS system works, and here is a bit longer explanation. Before you start tinkering with DNS try to grasp how the system works.
Server 1 simply redirected all port 80 traffic to Server 2. It was also being used to store files and run a couple other services.
Depending on how your systems are set up you could just add Server 1's IP address (possibly as an alias) to Server 2's network card and be done. If it won't work for whatever reason (e.g. routing), you have at least 3 possible roads:
If you decide to go via route 3, you again have several options :). Just note, that DNS servers are a crucial piece of infrastructure -- if they fail then people will be unable to reach anything within your domain. Also note, that to have your own DNS server, you have to own a domain. This means, that if you want to have a server in domainone.com you have to own the whole domain. If your host is alpha.domainone.com, but someone else owns beta.domainone.com, then you have to have the same server.
I asked my hosting provider if they could update their DNS cluster to point DomainOne.com to the same IP address as the second domain, but they require an additional fee to do so.
I'm very new to this, but I think my goal is to set up a custom nameserver on Server2, and update DomainOne.com to point to the nameserver running on Server2. Can someone maybe point me towards a good tutorial/explanatory guide showing how to accomplish this? I've Google'd a bit, but I got a bit lost. I have a good amount of Unix knowledge/experience, but very limited networking knowledge.
