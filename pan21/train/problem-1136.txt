Yes. Heat kills batteries, and sometimes the operating system is largely responsible for minimizing heat.
Running a new operating system has the potential to cause some harm if the complete thermal management solution is not supported. When software mitigations to reduce temperature cannot be used due to partial or missing driver support for heat generating devices, then the hardware and firmware safeties are all that is available. These hardware based safeties are to prevent danger to the user, and may be inadequate to prevent damage to the hardware (especially the battery) over long term use.
More and more we are seeing factory cooling systems that are inadequate for system power levels with software power management and throttling being relied upon to stay cool (see the i9 macbook pro for a premium example), so as time goes on this is increasingly likely. Another particularly good example of operating system ensured safety is the daisy sound chip in early arm chromebooks, which without safe limits in place, can physically melt the attached speakers when used with a non-chromeos system.
