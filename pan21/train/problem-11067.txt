Yes. Once again, you just choose the appropriate license model when starting up the instance.  You would just need to determine which is more cost effective for you based on how long you anticipate running this database within AWS, how much it would cost you to buy your own license from Oracle, and whether it would be cost effective to do that and pay the lower AWS rate instead of the higher rate for the "license-included" option.
You could launch it on a server like a db.m2.4xlarge which would offer more RAM.  That would give you 68gb, which I believe is the maximum currently available for an RDS instance.
What this means, in a nutshell, is that SE1 can only be licensed on a server with two physical CPU chips in it.  The AWS instances that contain 8 vCPU's are likely 2 socket servers with 4 cores per socket, so it would fall within the license guidelines.  An instance like db.r3.4xlarge wouldn't qualify because it likely has 4 CPU sockets.
AWS offers two license models, either "bring your own" or "license included".  If you use the license included model then Amazon will charge you a higher hourly rate for using the server than they would if you use your own license.  There are more details on these two license models in the RDS documentation for Oracle.  Amazon essentially uses a pay-as-you-go model by charging you for every hour your database is running.  All you do when you create your instances is select one of the two AWS license models.
