That's not what your code does.  Why are you requiring that a, b, and c be greater than 2, when they only need to be greater than 0?  Why does your prompt for n only say Give a positive number for the exponent "n" when it should say Give an integer greater than 2 for the exponent "n"?
Function calls should not be used as gotos.  Functions should accept parameters and return a result.  Your calls to user_input() and program_restart(), on the other hand, expect the execution to never return to the caller.  To see the problem with that, say "yes" a few times to retry the calculation, then hit CtrlC to abort.  You'll see the stack trace, which indicates that the ever-deepening stack is keeping track of all the calls, in anticipation for the opportunity to return control to the caller.  Since control never returns, the stack grows deeper and would eventually overflow.
It would be a more satisfying demonstration if the computer asked the user for a, b, and n, then solved for c, showing that c is not an integer.
