An unsigned driver is a driver whose creator didn't buy a digital code-signing certificate, and didn't use it to sign the driver. Such a digital certificate is only issued by any certificate authority (CA) after verifying that the certificate request was from a real company/individual, and whose details are incorporated into the signed driver. The digital signature is verified with the CA by Internet at the moment that the driver is installed.
This means that with a signed driver, its provenance is verified, and the contents of the driver file are also guaranteed to be exactly the same as at the moment it was signed.
As Windows Update in Win7 does a very good job of keeping the drivers up to date, I would seriously counsel to abandon DriverMax. An incorrect driver may destroy Win7 and prevent it from booting, requiring the reinstallation of Windows.
As far as I know, no major company ever issues an unsigned driver for Win7. This means that these drivers that DriverMax is suggesting come from small and cheap companies/individuals, or ones that prefer staying anonymous.
