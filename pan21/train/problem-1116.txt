I really think that when it comes to AWS/EC2 backup best practice, it's no different from any other server backup plan. Well, except for the handy EBS snapshots ofcourse, which save you lots of time.. But it cannot be stressed enough that snapshots alone do not provide the safety you want; Always take your own precautions as you would on any other server.
In case you mean website with 'site', and assuming you're running a linux flavour on an EBS backed EC2 instance (which in many cases would mean apache2, PHP and MySQL), i'd suggest the following:
And although this may seem as a lot of work, remember that with some effort you only have to set this stuff up on EC2 only once. You can create a base-AMI that takes care of setting up backups during instance installation (and all other base configuration you usually do).
I am sure there are a lot of way to backup a site, but I am currently overwhelmed of info overflow from Google search. I have a site running on Amazon AWS (EC2, EBS) and would like to have easy and best way to back up my data.
