The app.my_domain.com is the sub-domain of the webapp, the main domain is the main website which is located on a VPS server (different IP addy)
Thanks for the responses. I checked into your suggestions and determined it to be an issue with my server's hosts file. I added the IP address of my router with the myapp.my_domain.com and all is now well. 
I am trying to run a Django webapp with Apache and mod-wsgi. Every page take a solid 10 seconds to load. I've ruled out the MySQL database (enabled slow querie logging and they are all fast) so I think that I have an issue with DNS settings. I have the server in my office and I'm trying to access the webapp from within the same office LAN. When I run the webapp on the Django test server it is lightening fast, so I'm convinced it's apache or my networking settings somehow. 
Make sure you aren't using mod_wsgi in embedded mode, especially with Apache prefork MPM. If you are then you may be hitting a different process for every request and seeing the delay in loading Django the first time. If this were the case though you might expect that after a while as Django gets loaded, that response times then drop. This is not absolute though because if request load is very light, depending on how you have set up Apache, Apache could decide your processes aren't needed and shut them down, meaning that on subsequent requests after idle period, it is loading the whole of Django once again.
Better still, if you don't know much about setting up Apache or mod_wsgi, use daemon mode of mod_wsgi as that will save you from many of the mistakes you can make in setting up Apache badly for Python web applications.
If it's Apache, turn on ALL apache debugging and run it in the foreground. This ought to give you more hints as to what its doing.
in Apache configuration so that mod_wsgi logs stuff about when it is initialising Python in processes and loading WSGI script for first time. That will at least help you to eliminate that as the issue.
