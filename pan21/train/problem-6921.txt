For use in games, you might consider a library like TiMidity++ for playing back midi music in a cross-platform way, optionally using a custom set of music instrument sample sound.  If you're a fan of SDL, then SDL_mixer is an easy-to-use sound library which wraps around TiMidity++ and a few other sound libraries.
Yes, MIDI is still heavily used in the music industry.  At the low end, you'll find tools like Garage Band.  At the high end, you'll find tools like Reason.  These can either output standard audio files, or can be used to create MIDI data which can be played back in other tools (or games!)
The soundtrack for the original Unreal Tournament took the form of tracker music, which packages together both audio samples and sequencing information for triggering those samples.
I'm not sure every platform does have a complete set of General MIDI instruments, or an engine with which to play them, and if they did, I expect a lot of them would sound as bad as they did 10 years ago.
You might also look to the demoscene for inspiration. Soundtracks created in tracker software are the rule rather than the exception, and runtime synthesis is frequently employed as well.
