I'm newbie in VBA world. I have recently work with a spreadsheet with over 25000 rows and about 50 columns. Every time I calculate this sheet, it takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour to perform the calculation. Basically I have a row with basic formulas and the following rows just differs data from this row (i.e. the same formulas).

I hope someone could review and adjust my code or suggest any ideas to perform the calculation faster. I have heard that if code is optimized properly, it just takes about 10 mins to calculation 350.000-row data.
For example, I have a data in sheet Cal from A to N, and range from M to AR is calculated based on those data. Row 1 is "master" formulas, and traditionally I fill down this row to the end and press Save to calculate. It takes me 30mins - 1h. Then I build a macro but the problem about time has not been solved yet. The Macro is also attached in Module 1 of the file. Also the main code is:
