I don't even know where to start with this. I was thinking there might be some way to add the original sender's email into the message via some sort of meta info and having MS Exchange recognize that. Is it possible? What other methods could I use even if it's outside of Exchange.
If you really feel adventurous, you could write a transport agent which adds a X-Noreplies-MessageID: SomeUniqueID header, record the original sender and the unique ID in a database, and perform the opposite operation on receipt of a message directed to noreplies.
Although I am unaware of a method by which you can do this centrally from within Exchange, you could use the Reply-To header to suggest alternate delivery of a reply message.
Alternatively, if you require a non-interactive route, you could write a mail transport agent to check the contents of the From header, and place the value of the Return-Path header, which contains the actual user who sent the message, in the Reply-To header.
To do so, you would setup a "noreplies" mailbox and grant the "Send As" permission to those users who need such an ability.  Then, in Outlook, select the "noreplies" mailbox as the "From" address, and specify the "Have replies sent to" option with the address of the actual user.
The "From" address line is hidden by default, you can enable it in the ribbon.  The "Have replies sent to" option is under message options in 2003 and shows up in the ribbon as "Direct replies to" in 2007 and above.
Basically I'm looking to send emails from several accounts with "sender" listed as noreply@whatever.com and if someone replies back to that email it'll automatically get forwarded to the proper recipient (i.e. the original sender).
