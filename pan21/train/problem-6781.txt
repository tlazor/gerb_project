The big advantage of using multiple "spinning" disks is that you can get better seek times, particularly when reading a large file and needing to swap/page/access memory.  This is not really a concern for SSD, as it does not need to worry about repositioning the head, so its not nearly as important.  
If you are buying multiple disks - and ignoring Backup concerns as per your post, it might make sense to put swap and OS on one disk and data on another, but I would still be heavily inclined to configure them in a RAID0 or JBOD for maximum performance for $ as it will make very little difference in performance, if any.  
SSD drives are much faster then regular drives (in the order of 5 times).  With a high price tag per gig and a "sweet spot" of about 250 gigs at the moment.     It would seem awfully wasteful to get extra drives, particularly with 1 for swap, when you can just load up with memory and not need it !!
FWIW I've just bought some disks for a friend to put together a moderate/low end video Editing system, and we went for 1 SSD, and a large spinning disk.
(That said, If I were to ignore data security/backup on SSD I would not sleep at night, as when SSD's fail, they usually fail catastrophically and often with no warning, unlike most hard drive failures).
