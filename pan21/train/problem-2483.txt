If it is about text files copy an existing file and rename it. Open it and select all, delete. I admit, that this is more difficult than in Windows Explorer but you will get used to it soon and often you copy files that are similar in its contents so modifying from an existing copy makes it easier than writing everything from scratch. At least this is the case when dealing with code.
I saw in some blog (don't remember which - sorry) on a very simple way to do it which has a more TC authentic feel to it:
This way it works exactly like creating a new directory - and you can hardly notice it actually opens a shell window (it closes in less than a second).
Since TC Beta 9.0 (June 2016) this functionality is also present in the internal command list as cm_EditNewFile (2931 - Create+Open a new text file). This means you can now create a button that does this for you, if that's your thing.
In the command bar at the bottom I type copy con followed by the file name and [Enter]. I then either paste the file contents or just press [F6], as I would have done 25 years ago in DOS. From there you can [F4] the file into your configured editor.
