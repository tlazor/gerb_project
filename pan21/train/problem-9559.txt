Here is an example, I have an Linux instance , say, private IP is 10.10.10.10, public IP is 54.54.54.54.
I can imagine it's related with part which how public IP associate with private IP. Therefore, the inbound and outbound traffic is somehow lost.  But I would really want to know more details.
I don't see an issue pinging my own public ip from inside the instance. make sure you add a rule in the security groups associated with the instance.
Your elastic IP is not present on any local interfaces. If you want to bind a local service to an IP address, bind it to the private one and associate your EIP to it.
The reason I need to use it's public IP instead of localhost is because it's the same IP configuration which I will be used for this server as well as for other servers.
If you need to bind different instances of your service to different public EIP's, just use the same number of private IP's associated to them.
Inside the instance, I could successfully ping it's private IP(10.10.10.10) and localhost. However, I cannot access it's public IP(54.54.54.54).
