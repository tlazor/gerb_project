So, I wanted to install Ubuntu on a simple usb drive but it also installed grub2 on my system (which I didn't want) and now all hells broke loose. Apparently, it set the USB as dev/sda and my default windows as dev/sda2. How do I switch this around so that I can go through the BIOS and select boot from hard drive first (windows but it is held on dev/sda2) or boot from USB? I don't mind the grub but I don't want it to pop up every time I try to boot my laptop when I don't have the usb stick in. Or, is there a way to select dev/sda2 in grub for boot? (I have no knowledge of grub or BASH but know some batch but that probably won't be that helpful.) When the USB is in, it gives me the option to boot from windows from dev/sda2 but without it, it simply boots to grub.
Ouch...sounds like you may have a bigger problem....I been there.....in order to install Linux to the USB you should have used yumi or similar USB installer...hopefully you didn't change much on your main drive but you may now have to....if your system boots normal with the pen drive out great... You should be able to simply pull up your BIOS by pressing ESC,f1-12 or del keys at boot then go to your boot devices and set which drive you want to boot to instead as higher in the sequence. If you are still getting grub problems you may need to shrink your partition and and install Linux as dual boot to the unused area cleared....hopefully you did not wipe anything necessary for Windows to run.
You could also maybe use default Windows recovery software to repair Windows.  The nice thing if you still have Windows on any system get yumi and it will direct you to a number of great software that could help.
