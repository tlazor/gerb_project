For example, Python has Bokeh, Pandas, and Seaborn. Bokeh is for interactive visualizations which can help with digging deeper into the visualizations. See:
The visualizations in Tableau can be made easily -you can also interact with the graphs in various ways (like zoom in zoom out) and it doesn't require high-level coding skills.
I want to ask is there any tool that i can visualize the data, and manipulate the data at the same time please.
What I am doing now is using excel to plot, and when I see the pattern that I want, I hover over the data on the plot, read its index, then mark the data accordingly on the data. I think it is not very efficient, for example, i can not zoom or scroll.
You can use Tableau Public Software. Tableau Public version is a freeware in which you can connect to basic data sources such as excel, csv etc.
I'm not sure it's what you need, but for data mining without a single line of code (it works with widgets that you drag and drop), orange is definitely the way to go.
