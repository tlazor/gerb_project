For each 'exciting' dev position (e.g cutting-edge graphics, or gameplay coding on a big title), there's about 10 coders needed to to fairly dull work (front end, TRC/TCR compliance, tools, porting to the lesser platforms)
Coding positions seem to be becoming less exciting/creative and less respected with each passing year and increase in team size :(
As a career, games programming seems somewhat dead-end unless you have what it takes to start a studio of your own, or are willing to give up coding and aim for a management role...
Seriously: good programmers are hard to come by and there's a lot of inexperienced guys in the videogames industry.
I would say that that the "Hot position" when it comes to programmers is probably Lead Architect, Lead Engine, or any other name to the same job. Essentially the guy who gets to decide what to implement and how. It's often a person with very good knowledge regarding programming, someone who probably has one of the best overviews of the code in the company. I don't think that it's something that you often get recruited to externally, but instead most likely internally. It requires a lot of experience and often have a tendency to be the best "general" programmers that make it there. 
You won't make big money coding games unless you really get lucky (right place at the right time). The only real money is in founding a studio and selling up to a megapublisher. Or creating an unexpected big hit with a very small team.
Good audio programmers seem quite rare.  However this may not be a hard job to get because most game studios undervalue audio.
