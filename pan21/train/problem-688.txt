Once you've got the system booting from a disk with a "System Reserved partition you can think about breaking the Windows software mirror and going back to a hardware-based mirror.
You can do a bcdboot C:\windows /s x: to install the bootloader to this new volume. You can then mirror the boot OS partition into the remaining free space.
If the other admin didn't mirror the "System Reserved" partition then you have no boot loader on the disk (since on x64 versions of Windows the bootloader "lives" in this separate partition). If that's the case then you're best off adding another disk, creating the System Reserved partition and installing the bootloader into it, then mirroring the OS partition onto the remaining space on that disk. 
If you've got to prepare a new disk to receive the bootloader I'd add the new disk and use diskpart to create the "System Reserved" partition like so:
Once you've got a bootloader installed and the OS partition mirrored you'll be safe to attempt to boot from this disk. Not having your exact configuration in front of my I'm certain that I can't give you all the correct step-by-step commands, but it's definitely feasible to get a bootable environment running again. Likely you're going to become very familiar with the bcdboot command. 
If the other admin was kind enough to mirror the "System Reserved" partition to the other disk you could probably get away w/ booting a Windows 2012 setup DVD and running: bootsect /nt60 ALL  That'll write a Windows "6.0" MBR to the disk, which in turn will attempt to load the Windows boot loader from the "System Reserved" partition.
