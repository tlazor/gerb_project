You don't need to loop. The function SubString and the property Length is enought to handle what you want.
The reason I am saying this, is that there isn't much that is dynamic about this application, it is pretty set in simple rules.
I was looking at the fancy for loop from the_lotus's answer, and I am thinking that my single if block is going to be more efficient and easier to read. 
Although the for loop is shorter (code character wise) it is doing a lot more than this simple if statement.
Whitespace can help make your code nice and readable. However, TOO much whitespace can make your code hard to read. You fall into the latter case: you have way too much whitespace. A single blank line is all that is necessary to distinguish different logical sections.
Keep indents on the same level, otherwise you can confuse both yourself and potential readers later on. Currently you have:
This is confusing: does the Else statement go with another if statement? Do all the Module1.insert... statements belong inside the if statement or in another outside block of code?
Each iteration through your for loop, you get the length of sa(i) 3 times and could have to convert sa(i) to a string at most 3 times. Instead, do the calculations up front and store the results in a variable.
