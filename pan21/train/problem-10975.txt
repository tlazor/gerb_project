My colleagues at the company I used to work for (in PC support department) used to install windows directly to faulty PC's 2.5" and 3.5" HDDs using the profiles of their (client's) PC. This process used to reduce the installation time to about 15 minutes.
Simplest may be to start with a brand new build, install the required OS & initial software, then backup with something like Acronis True Backup (or whatever they call it this year, it keeps changing) with the Universal Restore add-on, which allows to 'restore' to any machine with bare minimum drivers to get it afloat; you then allow Windows itself to download more relevant drivers for that hardware setup.
I work on software development from a home based office but I am also the pc and mac repair go to guy of the family (and sometimes extended family) therefore I get at least one windows installation request every month.
(In rare cases this method can trigger some installer quirks, for example installers may refuse to work on 2 GB RAM machines, but usually everything goes smoothly.)
If anyone is aware of how to achieve this and can share the link or the process, I would highly appreciate that.
WinNTSetup requires a copy of Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 disk or bootable flash drive. You have to manually locate install.wim file on that media (look in the sources directory). Paths to other required files are derived automatically.
WinNTSetup is a tool which will put all necessary Windows installer files on a hard drive. Then you just have to boot that hard drive in any machine and it will start installing Windows, no external media required. Such hard drive isn't targeted for any specific hardware, it's just self-sustaining Windows installer, but having files already copied on disk can significantly reduce installation time.
There are more options available, but defaults are OK in most cases. All you have to do is select install.wim, click Setup button and wait until files are copied.
