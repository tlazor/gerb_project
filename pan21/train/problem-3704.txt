Before you do so disable any add-on repos.  A major problem you will face is that some add-on repos may install dependencies required for PHP 5.3 but not needed for PHP 5.2 (such as varying sqlite versions).  
If you continue down the path your headed, your probably going to run into what I call "dependency hell"  Old PHP needs old version of X, which is needed by a new version of Y, and if you want the old version of X, you need to downgrade Y as well, so on and so forth.   10-15 dependencies later, your running a reasonably insecure environment because a significant chunk of your system is running old code. 
everytime something like this happened to me (needing an older copy then what is in repo, or newer) I've found it easier to build my own RPM's from source, and i recommend doing that.
Its not too difficult, just a little more time consuming, and you can ensure your using the latest of everything ELSE on your system, and just the older (or newer) versions of PHP.
If all else fails, remove all php 5.3 packages with rpm -e --nodeps and then just re-install using the centOS sources.
The "Missing Dependency" error is often caused by mixing repositories. I suggest you disabled the atomic, epel repos and try again with CentOS testing repo based on this guide or Jason Litka repo.
