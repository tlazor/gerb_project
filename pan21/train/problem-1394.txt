You should learn Hadoop if you want to be work as data scientist, but maybe before starting with Hadoop you should read something about ETL or Big Data... this book could be a good starting point: http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343
In my mind, a good Data Scientist should be able to ask the right questions and keep on asking again until its clear whats really needed. Than a good DataScientist - of course - needs to know how to address the problem (or at least know someone who can). Otherwise your stakeholder could be frustrated :-) 
Out of the above points knowledge of Hadoop is useful for points 1,2 and 3, but you also need to have strong mathematical/statistical background and strong knowledge of Computational techniques to work in data science field. Also Hadoop is not the only framework that is being used in Data Science. Big Data ecosystem has a range of frameworks, each specific to a particular use case. This article gives introductory material regarding major Big Data frameworks that could be used in Data Science:
Data Science is a field demanding a variety of skills. Having knowledge of Hadoop is one of them. The main tasks of a Data Scientist include:
It strongly depends on the environment/company you are working with. In my eyes there is a "big data" hype at the moment and a lot of companies try to enter the field with hadoop based solutions - what makes hadoop also a buzzword but its not always the best solution.
