Note that not all of this functionality will be available if you do not have a domain (or are not using a domain member to connect), also Windows Firewall settings might prevent you from doing one thing or the other remotely. 
Normally, removing the SID-named key from the ProfileList does not do all that much of harm - it just removes the association between the user and her on-disk profile copy. If the user has a roaming profile defined, it is simply re-loaded from the profile path upon next logon and stored in a different local directory in C:\Users. If the user has a local profile, it is created anew in a different directory. Windows detects the presence of a conflicting directory in C:\Users and generates new names (e.g. by appending .<DOMAINNAME> to the user name). 
To troubleshoot why this process might be failing, try logging on with a different (maybe even a newly created) user interactively. Note that a Windows Server also has a whole bunch of remote administration features where the user's profile is not involved (and which would be unaffected by a possible profile corruption):
