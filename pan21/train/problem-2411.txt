If you need high speed and low cost, DSL's the way to go.  If you need absolute reliability and uptime guarantees, then you need the T1.
I'm trying to decide between multiple DSL lines and a single T1. If I went with DSL I would likely get 4 lines and then use a Ciso RV016 router to load-balance them. I'm not sure of what my true throughput would be, and if it would be a hassle to configure it properly for different sites.
DSL certainly gives you a lot more bandwidth for your buck, but keep in mind the three magic letters that you get along with the T1 line:  SLA.  "Service Level Agreement".  A contract guaranteeing that your T1 will be up at least some specified portion of the time.  With DSL, you can't get that and, even if you've got the wiring available for multiple DSL lines (Two? Maybe - the house may have been previously wired for a second voice line. Four? Highly unlikely.), they're going to be running through the same areas and likely the same conduits, so anything that takes one down will have a good chance of taking them all down.
I do web development from home. I'm moving to a house on a road with not very many people. The only options for wired high speed internet are DSL or T1. The DSL tests out at 1Mb/s down, 512kb/s up. The T1 would be 1.544Mb/s both ways. I've been quoted $30/month per DSL line or $220/month per T1. We don't have 4G in the area yet.
