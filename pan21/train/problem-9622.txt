It looks like the cut connector is being used to identify that as a port that shouldn't be used. I use a similar method but always use a non terminated connecter and affix a label or tag to the connector.
In addition, just to be clear, the physical ports (and cables connected to them) aren't "paired" together. They may be configured as a LAG, but their physical adjacency is not an indicator that they're "paired" together in any way, shape or form.
Test the ports thoroughly before trying to use them.  I can't speak for your predecessor, but one reason I've seen that done (with cut ends or empty crimped ends) is to "mark" bad or sketchy/lossy ports on a switch; it's a great way to see at a glance that a port should not be used.
One final note, plugging a host into an empty port and seeing no activity lights on the port is not a guarantee that there is no activity on that port or that the port is disabled, shut down, faulty, etc. The only guarantee would be to run a packet capture on the host connected to that port and verify whether there's traffic or not.
