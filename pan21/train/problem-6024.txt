It's a big pain and a lot of work, but I've been handling this issue with existing infrastructure at work, and I'd really recommend going to a combination of file-based backup and automated installation/configuration. You'll get a lot more flexibility in the long run and, though setting it up for existing hosts is a pain, it will save a lot of trouble when the image eventually needs to be installed on different hardware.
NOTE: Most of these require physical access. If this is to be done via a hosted solution then you may look at the dd/netcat option and you could substitute dd with cpio or tar.
Mondo Rescue doesn't require physical access. Once saved me from travelling 700km! I just created and downloaded the image, copied it onto a HDD and sent it via mail. Someone just loaded the disk onto slave server and it worked.
Note that /dev/sda is just a generic drive, use "fdisk -l" to find what your drives identifier really is.  
Ok... I have to throw this in... backing up Linux via imaging is a disaster waiting to happen. What happens when your hardware dies and you need to migrate to something different - different platform, drivers, etc.? What happens when you want to build a duplicate of the machine for testing, but need to change just a few things?
