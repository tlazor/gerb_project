draw_position_x and draw_position_o do two things currently - they add a move to the board and they draw it. You should separate those into two functions, one to add a move and one to draw the board, because drawing the board doesn't depend on the move that was just played. A separate draw function won't need any if statements, eliminating a lot of the duplication currently in the code.
You do also do not need a separate functions for placing an 'x' move and placing an 'o' move; use a single function and pass the move 'x' or 'o' as a parameter.
The three VERTICAL cases and three HORIZONTAL cases in win_check could be tested with a for loop over columns/rows, instead of repetition.
You should be able to eliminate one of these two while statements. You can have a single while num_moves < 9 and not win which is sufficient to keep execution in the main game loop until the game is over, and remove all the break statements within the loop. If you need or want to jump back to the top of the loop (for this program, perhaps after bad input) you can use continue instead of break.
You don't need to sys.exit() at the end of the program â€” the program exits when it reaches the end of the code.
