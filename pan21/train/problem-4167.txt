I wouldn't be trying to run anything production in 128MB of RAM these days, there's just too much bloat on a modern system, but if you're up for a challenge, have at it.  Oh, and replace lighttpd with nginx; sorry to all the lighttpd fans out there, but you've been superceded.
You're probably running a default mysql config that isn't tuned for a smaller RAM footprint.  You should probably use the my-small config (/usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.*/examples/my-small.cnf) which is billed as being for "<=64M".  I don't warrant that it'll perform at all well, but it should at least start.
Then I ask my hosting provider about it they just told me to buy more expensive plan because this one just  cannot possibly run MySQL because there is not enough ram. But I was aiming for server which could run with 96MB ram server!
I just installed MySQL server on my CentOS VPS... it's running at about 180MB RAM. Out of the box. Sounds like you gotta upgrade. It's almost certainly a RAM issue as your provider mentioned.
I have a 128MB RAM VPS server. I have Debian 32bit OS running on it and I have decided to install some light weight LAMP, so I installed lighthttpd and MySQL but then it had to be started It said it was starting.... and failed. I tried to look to error logs but they are clean. What could it be?
