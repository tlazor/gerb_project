not sure if this answers you question, but i had a similar problem of not being able to alter my default program settings for ms office programs, like you mention due to the virtualisation handler. 
Instead of fiddling in my registry i chose to get rid of the virtualisation handler. To do so you have to deinstall and instaal some office programs, see detailed instructions at:
I've installed MS Office 2010 Beta (OneClick technology). All apps launch from 1 program, Word for example has this link:
I had the same problem on Windows 7 OS.  I managed to fix it by simply going to Control Panel/Uninstall Program,  right clicking on MS Office and choosing the "change" option, this then performed a "repair" of the application and the association issue was fixed.
Are you sure you have the 64-bit version installed? It looks like the files were installed in the x86 program files directory, which only exists on 64-bit Windows. There's a 64-bit version of the Office beta available. It's possible that would work better. 
Choose which document type you want to set this for. Set it to open CVH.EXE. Open the registry editor. Go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.docx (for example - replace .docx with whichever extension applies). See what the REG_SZ value (Default) is set to. By default it will be something like Word.Document.12, but it may be something different on your system. Then, go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.Document.12\shell\Open\command (replacing Word.Document.12 with whatever the value was you got from the last step). Edit the REG_SZ value "default" to whatever you want the command to be; in your case, probably "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\Virtualization Handler\CVH.EXE" "Microsoft Word 2010 (Beta) 2014006204190000" %1. (%1 is the filename which you are opening)
Because of that I can't associate files with Office programs in file properties, they actually associate with “Microsoft Office Client Virtualization Handler” (CVH.EXE).
