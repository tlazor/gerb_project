Some people responded on the Apple forums that I should try and remove the dock's plist file. But this just restores the dock to its original settings! I don't want to lose my settings.
Snow Leopard works great! My mac's really fast after this. But sometimes the dock icons just disappear! I see the blue dot beneath when I click the empty space. So I know the item's there. But there are no icons! This happened for Safari and Downloads.
I had the same problem. Clobbering the plist is not a good solution if you've got a lot of customization in place.  For me the fix came when I selected "Show in Finder" when I clicked and held on the invisible icon.  The invisible icon magically reappeared and has seemed to stay back through a dock restart.
(This is probably only valid for snow leopard, and the path and filename has changed in 10.7 or 10.8)
I just had a similar problem; but, instead of disappearing, the icons were corrupted, like what happens to the display when a graphics board fails (a few were disappeared).  killall Dock did not work, but, removing the icon cache (in /var/folders/(2 letters)/(more letters)/-Caches-/com.apple.dock.iconcache)  and then killall Dock brought everything back.  You can get the path if you echo $TMPDIR and replace -Tmp- at the end with -Caches-
Open Activity Monitor, find and Quit the Dock Process.  Dock will restart with icons.  Not sure how permanent this 'fix' is.
