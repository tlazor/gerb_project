In our business we have about 300 PC's. What I want to achieve is to change the homepage on all browsers (IE, Chrome and Firefox). The problem is that I can't find any way to set/change the homepage on Chrome for all computers at once.
See Google's Help document Set Chrome policies for devices.  They provide Group Policy templates you can add on your Domain controller, so you can configure policies to set things like the home page.
Here you have a place where Chrome configuration is stored:  http://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory
