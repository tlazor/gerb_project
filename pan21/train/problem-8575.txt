Assuming the two NICs on the servers are used to separate production and backup traffic, use VRFs. That's the best traffic separation technique there is. For more scalability (not sure you need it based on the diagram), throw full-blown MPLS/VPN in the mix, it runs on both Cat 6500 and ASRs.
We have two geographically separate data centers.  We are preparing to implement a new WAN connection (dark cloud) that would be used only for backup traffic.  The servers will have two NIC cards (production & backup) but what is the best way to ensure that the production and backup traffic doesn't mix?  At the moment we are just using static routes to get to the WAN, but looking to implement BGP between our SP and ourselves.  Internal RP is a mix of EIGRP and OSPF.  Cores are Cisco 6500s and WAN routers will soon be upgraded to ASRs.
Another option that could give more flexibility is to use QoS and simply PbR based on the queues, if you design it right you even get automatic failover from the primary to the backup, but not the other way round.
For the IGPs, cant you just use the regular metric tuning? EIGRP - just manipulate the delay and for OSPF the cost. Once it hits the BGP core, cant you use BGP meds.  For my company (financial intuition) i know thats what we do. We have an A feed and B feed. A feed will have better internal metrics than B. Once it hits our BGP core then its pretty much what I listed above.
