Wait... I figured it out, after realizing that you can use regular expressions. I ended up doing this as my single server section:
However I feel that it's a little bit fragile the way it's set up right now. What if the IP address changes? Or what if the DNS entry changes? I would prefer if it would simply respond to all requests on port 80, regardless of the hostname.
I've also got an upstream section for thumbor, based on this guide. And this works; I can access it via http://ec2-52-1-2-3.compute-1.amazonaws.com/... or via http://52.1.2.3/...
As you can see all I did there was pare it down to a single server section instead of two, and I removed the server_name variable from that section. But rather than responding to all requests like I hoped, it no longer responded to any. It would 404 on everything.
This is a part of my /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file. (I've modified it here slightly as to not disclose the actual IP address or DNS entry, but you get the idea.)
No need for regular expressions. You can do it by appending default_server to your listen directive, like so: listen 80 default_server;. This points to the configuration which is to be applied if a request is directed at server IP but no hostname is matching.
