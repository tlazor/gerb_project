There is insufficient information about how the current network is laid out to know what must be replaced to achieve the end goal stated. But you may not have to replace all the little dumb switches, at least not in one fell swoop.
Given the described setup you already have two different networks running separately, so only the new criterion of separating the phones from the wired clients would seem incompatible with "each dumb switch is within a single VLAN"
If the problem is MOSTLY running out of addresses, all you need to do is move to larger subnets - go from /24 to /22 and you have 4x (+6) the addresses you had on /24.
In order to move to VLANs you will need to replace some or all switches - whether that's "some" or "all" depends on the other infrastructure you have - if a "dumb switch" and its connected clients are all on the same VLAN, you don't have to replace it, you just need to make sure that the VLAN-Capable switch port it connects to (or connects to, eventually) has the proper VLAN as its PVID so that untagged traffic becomes traffic in the correct VLAN.
