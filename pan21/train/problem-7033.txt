Oh and Altiris has a configuration tool also so you can run scripts remotely and rename many machines at once and remote control many machines at once (depending on your network speeds)
RIS is ok (remote installation service) Windows its a bit painful to setup but its good in the aspect of UUID's and SID's etc.
Frankly, there are more systems to do this kind of thing than one can shake a stick at.  Already mentioned have been Altiris (currently owned by Symantec), WDS, and Ghost.  All 3 I have seen used in production environments to great effect.  Another great utility is Zenworks by Novell.  Most of those, however, are for pushing down images, rather than from scratch builds.  For UNIX/Linux systems you can use Cobbler.  It supports both PXE boot through DHCP as well as boot discs.
Yep altiris is an excellent solution.  It also allows you to control workstations on your network reimage machines all while sitting at your desk.  We use it in a college environment and I can image 30-40 workstations at a time easily. it uses PXE and has wake on lan.
