For example, about 10 years ago I administered a SQL 2005 instance containing a 200+ GB database with 500+ VLFs and after lowering/reconfiguring their amounts/sizes recovery times significantly improved.  A similar database with a similar configuration on SQL 2012 years later didn't have any issues, and this was likely because of the newer version of SQL as well as the updated hardware.
For now, I suggest you look at recovery times for dbs with 1000 VLFs to start with.  If that number of VLFs doesn't seem to adversely affect recover/startup times, adjust your threshold to 1500-2000 VLFs before you start worrying and further adjust as needed .  Really, your configuration is going to dictate the threshold you should be concerned with.
In older versions of SQL, the threshold where VLFs started to affect recovery times were lower, but with newer versions of SQL you may not see any ill-effects until you get past the 5k mark or even higher.  A lot of it really depends on your hardware configuration and the version of SQL Server you're running.
