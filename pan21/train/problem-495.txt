Initially I successfully completed a whole disk encryption of my Window 7 32 bit HP laptop with Truecrypt.  Subsequently, this same laptop was knocked off a table while CC Cleaner was running.  On reboot I ran into many issues and had to go back to an earlier system version using a System Restore.  After the laptop was stable, I also fully decrypted the drive.  I have used a couple of tools to clean up the machine and fix registry issues after the decryption.
I an now attempting to re-encrypt this same hard drive with Truecrypt.  I disconnect all external items such as printers, phone chargers, and turn off Network/Internet access, and stop my antivirus software and end all un-needed processes, such as Bonjour, iTunesHelper.exe, etc.
I would appreciate any advice on what may be going on that is keeping me from fully encrypting my drive.
The hard drive is probably failing or damaged.  Have you tried another hard drive in the laptop? Does the drive stop at 96% or run really slow because it's having a hard time encrypting the data?
Truecrypt now quickly encrypts the drive until around 96% of the drive is encrypted, then stops working, and freezes the balance of the laptop.
