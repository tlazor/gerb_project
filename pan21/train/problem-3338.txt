As Josh stated a firewall may be configured to allow HTTP traffic to a particular host but it may not allow ICMP traffic to that same host, so the fact that your ping request times out tells you nothing about the status of that web server. The fact that your ping requests time out somewhere "in the middle" only means that those hosts don't respond to ICMP requests and again, tells you nothing about why you can't access the web site.
At the end of the day, the 500 error tells you all you need to know: you're getting to the web site but the server is having some problem. The best you can do is to communicate this information to the party that's responsible for the web site.
While ping and tracert are good basic connectivity and path discovery tools, they're not the correct tools for diagnosing web site connectivity issues. A 500 error clearly means that you've gotten to the web site but that the server has some problem. The fact that your colleague can get to the web site tells you almost nothing. The web server may be having an intermittent problem or it may be geographically dispersed and you're hitting a cluster or server that's having problems while your colleague is hitting a cluster or server that isn't having problems.
