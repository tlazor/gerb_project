One issue is that delegation to taxiwayalpha.com is set to ns1.gavincoates.com and ns2.gavincoates.com however querying the zone returns only ns.taxiwayalpha.com.
You need to have your domain updated with your registrar to use the right name (ns.taxiwayalpha.com. ) and because the NS is in its own zone you'll need to send them the right IP address for its glue record too.
Despite trying a couple of DNS testing utils online, it appears that the domain is not resolving to the server correctly.
I recently transferred one of my domains to a new server, and ever since I am having intermittent issues accessing the site. taxiwayalpha.com does not work, www.taxiwayalpha.com occasionally works, and email also does not work. 
Appears your nameservers are not returning NS records for your domain.  You need to have NS records for your domain.
Uh oh, we have a mismatch.  Your records at the .com registry are inconsistent both in name and in the glue records.
A second issue is that both ns1.gavincoates.com and ns2.gavincoates.com resolve to the same address. This is the same address that ns.taxiwayalpha.com resolves to.
