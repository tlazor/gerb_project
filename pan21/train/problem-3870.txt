However this sort of hardware/firmware password would be requested by the computer prior to any indication of Windows booting. It isn't clear from your question if this is the case.
You may be able to reset this by removing and replacing the battery on the motherboard. If in doubt obtain a user-manual for the specific model of computer or for the motherboard.

Simply put a Linux LiveCD (either USB or CD/DVD) in the PC and reboot. Start the installation and you'll be asked if you want to format the pc.
If you have no way of logging in, you will probably have to do a hard-reset (switch the power off/on), but otherwise, you don't need any user rights in Windows to reinstall a computer. This works for Windows, Linux or any other OS.
