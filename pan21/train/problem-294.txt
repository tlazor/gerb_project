Put this script in a bat file and use one of the options cited by Charlie to make it run at boot time.
If you care that in case of a fatal error inside the container, please use --restart option on the docker run command.
Finally enter your service name in the box at the bottom of the GUI, you can then feel free to test with the other options on the additional tabs. 
The goal is to be able to use build Docker images, start as containers and run e2e tests against them. Since we are using TeamCity for building any ideas about solving this with TeamCity would also work I guess.
I'm in a situation where I need to run docker on a windows based build server (I'm normally working with Arch/Debian Linux) and I can't find a way to have the docker VM to start automatically on system boot. On Linux it would be a service but on windows that does not seem to be the case.
Just a small addon: When you start your docker images and want them to start at boot of docker (in this case the virtualmachine running docker) you can use the --restart always option in the docker run command.  Then you can remove the docker run command from your batch files.  The container should start automatically after the vm started.
I followed the instructions on https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/ and everything runs when I start the docker VM with $ docker-machine create but how to have this as a Windows service or similar?
With following script you can specify which boot2docker machine launch. Since Docker Toolbox folder may not be in your path and all the proper environmental variables may not be set, I wrote some initialization instructions.
