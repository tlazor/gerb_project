Update:  The newest technical preview versions of Windows 10 Anniversary update have two services "SSH Server Broker" and "SSH Server Proxy". These are both built-in to windows 10 Build 14366 and above. It is still unclear about the client however and I have been looking unsuccessfully for Microsoft documentation about these two services...
Both of which are read-only except for TrustedInstaller. The configuration seems to be similar to OpenSSH since Microsoft is building a custom implementation for Windows. I also found this from the Microsoft Powershell Github repository on OpenSSH on installing OpenSSH:
SSH Server Broker and SSH Server Proxy are 2 new services present on Windows 10 Anniversary (can be found at running services.msc from command prompt or pressing win+r). This service is not running under the (Ubuntu) Linux Subsystem for Windows. 
Long answer:  It's not actually part of Windows 10, but rather a new feature Microsoft is adding to PowerShell.  Microsoft is working with and beginning to contribute to the OpenSSH project.  This will effectively put an SSH server on Windows but you'll have to turn it on and have the latest version of PowerShell.  I have not heard any release date for PowerShell with the OpenSSH functionality mentioned yet.
Does the release version of Windows 10, as rumored, have built-in SSH server functionality? If so, how do I go about enabling it?
If enabled port 22 is open and you can login with a local user. The user must be in the Ssh Users group. With a Microsoft account the username is the one displayed at lusrmgr.msc
