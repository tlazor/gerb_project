At this point you can test already if the windows system is able to boot from the copied partion. The data of the old windows partion is still unchanged (just invisible) and could be re-created easily with fdisk.
Would anybody care to fill me in on why Windows is refusing to extend the partition? What will I have to do in order to extend the partition with the remaining 140GB on the drive?
The extend button is greyed out: that's because the Volume that you are trying to resize is a system partition which is in use so you can not do a change on it,
I can't use the Windows snipping tool with a context menu open (and my keyboard lacks a print screen button), but believe me when I say that the extend button is greyed out when right clicking the Windows 8 partition. I've tried using DISKPART.exe too:
Windows 7 "Extend" feature works only if the unallocated size is to the right. Yours is to the left. You will need to use a 3rd party partition application (PartedMagic/GParted). 
I'm absolutely blown away by how impossible this task appearing to be. I've been through probably a hundred separate Google search results, every single one explaining how to "right click the volume and click extend". Well guess what, the extend button is greyed out. Here's a screenshot of Disk Management:
