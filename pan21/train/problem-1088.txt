You may also want to check the CPU and chassis fans for stuff stuck in them that may be causing the noise (take a can of compressed air to them).  Dirty fan bearings can kind of sound like elecrical buzzing, so if you can stop each fan for a second while it's running (without cutting the tip of your finger off), that will help you eliminate them.
Its most likely the fan on the CPU making this noise.  Some very cheap fans use sleeve bearings which wear out after a few years of running.  You'll need to get that replaced.
I'm 90% sure it's the fan making the noise as it sounds in sync with the airflow. I recently turned a retired desktop in my house into a Ubuntu Server (Samba shares, local IM, Print server, headless VM, etc...). At night when it was quiet I started hearing a chirping sound, as if a bird was stuck somewhere. It would chirp a couple times, and stop. A couple seconds-minutes would go by and it would do it again. It took me a while to locate the sound and realize the CPU fan was the culprit. Never underestimate the weird sounds your PC can make.
I can't really tell anything by that MP3 file, but "Zappy" noises usually come from failing components in the power supply.  The more CPU (etc) you use, the more strain on the power supply, so the zapping may increase under load.
The heatsink on top of the CPU may also be full of dust.  I was servicing an old server and found out that the CPU fans would immediately speed up to around 70% as soon as a terminal server user logged in.  Turns out that cleaning the dust out from the fans and the case were the answer.
