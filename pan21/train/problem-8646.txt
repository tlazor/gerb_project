The link-local protocols that send frames without tags will still work. They really are not part of a VLAN, native or otherwise.

If you've seen configs online where it supposedly works differently, and it's definitely Cisco equipment, it's probably a mistake or a typo. I haven't worked on literally every Cisco operating system, but all the ones I've seen (which are many/most of them) work the same way.
The NATIVE VLAN should NOT be included on the "switch allowed vlan" list. However, the NATIVE VLAN should also NOT be used for ANYTHING else. If you have a vlan defined for any device/access port, then that VLAN must be allowed on the trunk port, and should NOT be used for the NATIVE VLAN.
The one big reason to not include the native VLAN is the list of allowed VLANs is that a native VLAN is a security risk. The current best practice is to not include the native VLAN in the allowed VLANs on a trunk, and to not use VLAN 1 for anything. There is a misconception that you must have a native VLAN on a trunk.
In short, once you put a switch trunk allowed vlan command on an interface, you deny all VLANs on that interface except for the ones specifically allowed in the command.
