The general theory is that you'd want to watch for HDD activity and modify the keyboard status bits as appropriate. In that sense, if you're so inclined, it would certainly be "possible" to use the keyboard status lights as an HDD status light--if you're willing to put forth the effort needed to learn systems programming.
The easiest way to get a useful display of hard drive activity would be to install the System Load Indicator, which displays interesting statistics like CPU and RAM usage, as well as hard drive activity. This is an on-screen utility as opposed to modifying the keyboard's status lights, but is probably the closest thing you're going to find on Ubuntu without writing your own code.
If you were interested in trying your hand at writing your own code, however, you're free to do so. This is a benefit of using Linux. The keyboard uses a microprocessor that can be programmed via the CPU. On really old systems, the BIOS does this, and on newer systems, the OS does this, but either way, with a bit of work, you can write code that does this, too.
