This is a known issue with most programs that "interact with the session". When a RDP session is disconnected from the session "shuts down" and anything that would interact with the UI no longer works. If you minimized your RDP session you would likely see it there too.
But when my workday ends i turn off my computer and disconnect the RDC and this is when the problem starts : if i'm not logged, the app that simulate keystrokes won't work properly. The VPS is still running and the session is still active, but everything that simulates keystrokes does not work.
The only way around this I know of is not to use RDP and see if you can get something like Teamviewer Host, or some other similar software that lets you take over the "console session", that way the console can stay logged in even after you disconnect.
I have a Windows 2008 VPS and connect to it using Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc.exe). I run on it an app that does some tasks simulating keystrokes. It runs perfectly when i'm logged on the VPS and most of the time, i'm logged on it.
Is there a way to change this behaviour ? I want the machine to run all the time exactly how it runs when i'm connect to RDC.
