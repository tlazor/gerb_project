I have a Raspberry Pi B R3, and I want to configure it to be a server. I am planning on plugging it directly to my router and then using SSH to control it. I have turned on SSH, moved my RPi to the router to try it, plugged it in, and then logged into the settings page of my router. However, it doesn't show up under "LAN COMPUTERS." Is this where it's supposed to show up? There's another place for WLAN connections, but I'm using ethernet.
I would've put this question under RPI.SE, but I think that it's more my router's problem than my Pi's.
I have also tried to set a static IP address on the Pi, but I can't tell if it's working because it won't open in Putty, and there is no monitor nearby. The only thing that I can connect my RPi to is my 50' TV about 60 feet away from my router, so moving it isn't an option, and I don't have a ethernet cable that long.. It will be easy to use with SSH once I get it running, but I can't seem to get it going. Is this a problem with my router or with my RPi configuration?
