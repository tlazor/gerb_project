i'd say nothing better than command-level settings for security solutions to control everything implemented... though
Squid and other proxys can be configured to only transfer clean traffic... There is allot of packets of dirty data floating around on the internet, allot of them can be ignored. 
I used OSSEC HIDS. Basically, it checks file integrity (/etc/passwd,...) and parses log files (syslog, auth.log,...). It has usable web interface and email notification. But nothing special, I guess.
don't know how good you'll find it, but can have a look at Scrrenshots @ http:// sguil.sourceforge.net / screenshots.html
If you run snort on your proxy server, databases and logs are not maintained on a weekly basis, sooner rather than later your proxy server is going to hang from lack of resources.
For just network monitoring or intrusion on the system? A file integrity scanner can be beneficial, but it takes work to maintain as it needs updating each time you update the system and needs a bit of initial tuning. See the Open Source Tripwire page for information on that.
A more desirable option would be to setup a dedicated machine and dedicated monitoring NIC connected to a mirror port on your main switch.
Snort with an interface like BASE or ACID use a lot of CPU cycles, RAM and SQL space (Physical storage). If your dealing with a production level environment IDS must be setup correctly or it becomes pointless very quickly.
So say you have a genuine interest in IDS, You will require a serious server depending on your traffic though-put to support both the Squid + Snort + Apache + MySQL + PHP WebGUI.
IDS is different from IPS (intrusion protection system). Why the requirement for IDS, do you plan on reporting attacks or building firewalls to stop dirty network traffic?
