Most ISP's don't do this, and all of your devices will be exposed to the internet without the benefit of NAT or firewall functionality from the router. 
Without knowing your router nobody can say for certain; if your router does support it, it'll probably be described as "bridged mode" or similar.  Check with your ISP first to make sure they will give you that many addresses and don't have other restrictions (some still don't permit anything but their provided router or some designated machine, and may check MAC addresses in an attempt to enforce this).
This depends on your ISP. If they will assign you multiple addresses via DHCP, the easiest way to do this would be to get rid of the router entirely and use a switch: plug one port on the switch into the LAN port on your DSL/cable modem, then your other devices also plug into the switch.
Okay, I don't know if this is possible, but I was wondering if it were possible to turn of the DHCP server in my router and have my ISP assign global IP addresses to all the devices on my network.
