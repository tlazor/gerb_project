I have switched from using Youtube (as I described in my previous answer) to using Transcribe  It works much better, in my opinion, and has a very nice auto loop feature that might suit your needs.  Their website says you don't need to be connected to the internet while you are looping.
I have found two alternatives, but they are not ideal, so I was wondering if anyone knew of a better one. Here they are:
I'm not sure what you mean by looping, but I will tell you how I type transcripts. After trying several different pieces of software, I discovered that Youtube has something built in that works really well for me.  The video automatically pauses as you type, and the transcript and the video (or audio file) stay in sync with each other.  You can also select and copy the whole text you've typed to insert in some other program, such as MS Word.
I need to listen to audio files in short looped fragments (useful for transcribing). I have found a few apps that let me define regions (VLC, Audacity) and that let me play these regions in a loop, but there is no easy way to move the looped region over so I can keep listening to the file.
Just make sure you don't use the automatic transcript feature.  Also make sure you have set the file to "private."
