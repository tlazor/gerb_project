You can use Memtest OS X to test the system's memory, but as TECHIE007 noted, clicking sounds indicate a hard drive problem rather than a memory or video problem. 
A few days ago i formatted it and reinstalled yosemite os after 7 tries (mac froze during installs) after completing a full install it worked finw for an hour or two but then it happend again.
If your hard disk drive supports Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART), you can use the diskutil command to query the SMART status. E.g.:
Everything you've mentioned tells me your hard drive is faulty, that's what's clicking and tweeting, and why you're experiencing freezes and lockups.
i have a mid 2010 macbook pro 4gb ram and nvidia card 13.3" . Sadly enough a few months after I bought it it started freezing . The screen is just static and unreaponsive. prior to that i installed and then uninstalled win7 via bootcamp. I recall having a crash during a reset and my macbook lost 250gb of it's capacity.
You can also check the SMART status using the Disk Utility program found in Applications/Utilities. You will see S.M.A.R.T. status displayed near the bottom of the window when you select the drive.
4.5 years passed since theb and ive been suffering hard from random freezes that left me with no other choice but keeping hard rebooting it.
