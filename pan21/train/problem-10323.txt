I've been doing some Googling, and just can't wrap my head around how to determine what type of RAM I will need. I think the main issue is that I don't understand what the different types of RAM are (DDR, DDR2, DDD3, PC400, PC3200), the different speeds, the different physcial sizes (160 pin, 184pin, etc), SIMM, DIMM, DRAM, SDRAM, dual channel, single channel, etc. If you consider the many different permutations that the above can result in, you will understand my predicament.
It's best to look at the manual or system documentation from the manufacturer.  Another alternative (although slightly less reliable) is to see what a site like crucial.com recommends.
I have to upgrade the RAM on 8 different desktop PCs - each of them with varying specs, different ages, different manufacturers, different motherboards, etc. I'm pretty sure they don't all use the same type of RAM.
I've found Crucial's website to be phenomenally useful for this. http://www.crucial.com/uk/. (Other manufacturers may have similar tools). Select your motherboard from the lists and it tells you exactly what it can hold. 
Another useful tool for hsowing what you currently have is CPU-Z: http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html - It'll give you the full breakdown of the RAM you have installed and how many free slots you have. 
It heavily depends on the process, motherboard and chipset used, so there is no single answer to this.
