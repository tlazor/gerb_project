Option shortest (finish encoding within shortest input) cannot be applied to input file pic.jpg -- you are trying to apply an input option to an output file or vice versa. Move this option before the file it belongs to.
Checkout the the option -shortest must to be in front of the output file if not I get the below error: 
FFmpeg will try to pick the best codec automatically, depending on the extension of your output file. 
This is not a bug, however, just a mechanism by which you can specify which infile arguments apply to.
Update: I noticed YouTube has difficulty processing the video (gets stuck at 95%) I think because there's only one frame.  The solution I found to make YouTube happy: add more frames.  Also, I added-acodec copy to preserve the audio quality. You need -shortest or it loops forever. (It stops at the end of the shortest stream, which is the audio, because the image loop is infinite.) The order of your options is very important for speed, as filters (and such) are processed in the order you specify. If you change the order of these parameters, the results are dramatically different. 
Also notice that I set the frame rate twice, that's not an accident--the first frame rate is for the input, second is for the output. If you do this correctly, there should only be one frame per second of video, which means it encodes relatively fast. Also I set the resolution to 720p here, which means you should get HD audio on YouTube :-)
I did not use -loop 1 or -shortest. -loop 1 drastically slows down the encoding and creates a larger file. -shortest should not be used without -loop 1 since then the video will be one frame long. However YouTube does not like videos with one frame (see PJ Brunet's answer) so then both options should be used.
