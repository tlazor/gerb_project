But it appears you are looking for iPhone Game development/programming, not game design. The major book at the moment appears to be Beginning iPhone Games Development.
Keep in mind the differences between game development (the all-inclusive process of making a game), game programming (writing the code that makes a game happen), and game design (designing the game: plot, characters, mechanics, etc.). You seem to be using them interchangeably.
There is also iPhone Game Development: Developing 2D & 3D games in Objective-C which has a wide range of reviews, good and bad; I'd give it a second thought before purchasing.
Stupid StackExchange... I had more links for you, but I need higher rep before I can link them.  I'll try to put them in as comments...
Just my $0.02, but you should always start with the fundamentals - FUN.  Raph Koster's "A Theory of Fun" is a great read.  Here's a review:
The problem is, if you're looking into iPhone development, Objective-C is your only language option as far as I know, and development for the iPhone is considerably different than PC development. I think in this case you'd do best to try one of these two books, rather than starting with a PC game development book.
While a couple of the chapters are grossly outdated (the book was written in 1982), The Art of Computer Game Design has some great ideas and principles.
