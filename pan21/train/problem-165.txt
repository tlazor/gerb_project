This was a bit confusing for me as well. I have 7.1 audio on my system. VLC always defaulted to stereo audio. Then I finally figured it out. You must have your sound cards speaker configuration set to 5.1 or else VLC will not choose the 5.1 track. I thought that 7.1 set for speaker configuration on my sound card would work for anything so the system would play 5.1 or 7.1 if available. But apparently with VLC, and maybe some other programs, your system must match exactly or it will not recognize your settings. This is a feature that the VideoLan team needs to fix. With the advent of 7.1 audio VLC needs to recognize that it can play 5.1 audio on a 7.1 system.
From what I understand, it should automatically detect whether the source media is surround sound or not.
There's also the respective setting in the GUI version of the settings under "Audio->Effects->Dolby Surround". Is has the options "Auto", "On" and "Off".
Only if your audio format is dts/dolby digital 5.1, the 5.1 channel could activated in VLC. If the original file is of only stereo type, the 5.1 option will not get highlighted in the above said menu. You try using SURCODE DTS and Gold wave software for converting a stereo file into user defined 5.1 DTS file.
