There is aprogram called EasyFile. I think it's the best user-friendly and simple solution for windows by now. And it's free at this time. 
I don't like how Windows displays a mix of drop down menus (seen in the left column) and standard folders, and I don't like how I can't see all the folders and files in the directories above mine--only in the topmost directory (seen in the lefthand column). This makes it much slower to switch between folders in different subdirectories, especially when you don't remember how many layers deep a file might be. 
I'm switching from a Mac to a PC with Windows 10. Is there anyway (either 1st party or 3rd party) to make the File Explorer in Windows 10 look like Finder's column view in Mac OSX?
The site is in German and I don't know if there's an English Version of the program available. But you could try it at least.
In contrast, with the Mac OSX Finder column view, all my directories at all levels are clearly visible in neat columns, and you can even enable it to show the path bar at the bottom, just like Windows shows at the top of the File Explorer.
