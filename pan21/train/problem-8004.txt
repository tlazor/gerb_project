The original source files have been lost, and I've been asked to extract the map images, preferably without the text and icons that have been overlaid on top of them. This has proven annoyingly difficult.
-Select the object (you can get most, but not all, of them (e.g. student computers icons can't be selected), then delete
So ... is there any way I can retrieve the map images from this thing without also getting the text and icons?
Open the document on your screen, zoom in on the picture to make it as large as possible but all of it is still visible.  Press alt+prnt scrn (or the equivalent on your operating system) and it should take a screen shot of the program.  Now open up paint or your favorite image editor (photoshop, gimp, etc) paste in the picture and crop out anything you don't want.
You can download the XPDF library from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html for Linux and Windows. Then run pdfimages -j input.pdf output and you should get output-000.jpg, output-001.jpg, etc. Also, check out http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/pdfimages1.html for more usage options.
I've even tried opening the PDF manually in a text editor and extracting the stream objects by pasting them into a new file and saving it with a .jpg, .png, or .bmp extension (each in turn).  Considering how little I know about the internal structure of PDF files, it's no surprise that this didn't work.
Ok, after messing around with this for 5 minutes, my analysis is that PDF is even weirder than I originally thought, and that's saying something.
