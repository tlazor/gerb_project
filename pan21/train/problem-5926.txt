Best method to recover deleted emails is to restore from backup. Second try deleted items option, Go to got to Folder tab in MS Outlook and click on "recover deleted items" option.
Hoping someone could help out with this/provide some answers.  Basically, our organization got hit with a ton of spam messages all sharing the same subject.  To mitigate the damage, one of our admins ran a command in the exchange 2010 shell to search all mailboxes for emails with this subject and delete them.  
The issue however is that while the command he ran deleted all the malicious spam emails, it also ended up deleting emails with very similar subjects as well which our users need.  We already attempted the recover deleted items feature in the Outlook client for affected users as well as searching the dumpster via Exchange shell - neither has turned up any results that we would be cable to copy to a target mailbox or anything.
As such, the items are permanently removed - ie: gone. This is why it's always recommended to use the -LogOnly parameter first to ensure you are only deleting what you want to be deleted. 
Our deleted items retention seems to be set for 30 days across our DB's.  Is there any other ways of possibly recovering these messages that were deleted?  Please let me know if any additional info/clarification is needed and really appreciate the help in advance!
