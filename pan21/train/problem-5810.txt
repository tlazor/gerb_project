Just adding that a common fault on an aged system is the capacitors going, they have a defined lifetime after which they break down.
Normal temperature for a CPUs and video cards vary a lot by manufacturing era. Generally, CPUs should stay under 60C at load, just as old video card; the new video cards under 80C at load are fine (can even work correctly at 100C).
CPU temperature can be checked in BIOS. Video card GPU temperature can be seen in the driver's control center/panel (will not work for very old cards). As for the power supply temperature, in most cases it has no temp monitoring, you will just have to check how hot is the air evacuated from it.
If they go you can usually tell because the capacitor swells in size. The capacitors look like tiny batteries and on the top of the aluminium can is an inscribed X and you may see this end has swollen or in some cases burst.
P.S. This also works very well when some part of your computer is making a noise and you can't tell where it is coming from, put the tube up to your ear and you can hear where the mystery squeal is coming from.
from a paper towel or toilet roll. If you stick your noise inside it while you sniff it makes your smell ability a lot more directional and makes it easer to narrow down what section of the computer the smell is coming from.
