Detailed instructions, including a step-by-step manual fix (which still requires the recovery CD) can be found here.
If you punch "BOOTMGR is missing" into your favorite search engine, you'll find dozens of articles explaining how to fix this.
You can't really prevent this ahead of time because you can't reliably predict what the disk layout will look like when the boot device is changed without changing it. The recommend processes is to fix it after it breaks.
Well, first you could have completely erased the partition that Windows XP was located on so that it didn't see it at all. But before installing windows 7 on a partition it's best to chose a partition then erase it and select "new" then format it so that it properly creates the boot partition along with the partition for the OS. I also agree with what David Schwartz said, if you boot off of the installation CD and do a repair, it usually is able to fix your problem or open up Command Prompt from the recovery console and run a fixboot or fixmbr.
It's not that the partition isn't bootable (or you wouldn't get this far), it's that the boot loader isn't there and the disk order changed. Windows 7 startup repair can fix this. You can also do this from the recovery console. (I think the command is fixboot or bootrec /fixboot.)
The recovery tools to fix the boot process won't do anything if your computer can already boot, so there's apparently no way to change the boot partition on a bootable system - you have to break it before you can fix it, and you need alternate windows startup media (like a recovery CD) in order to fix it.
