I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to ask but I was wondering if it is possible to change where Task Scheduler store its logs? I have an .aspx that can read log files from virtual directories that are stored in IIS. I want to add the task scheduler log to my aspx page like I do with the other log files but I don't want to add a virtual directory to C:\WINNT (where it is currently logging to) because of just me being paranoid. If it is not possible to change the log destination then I will be able to find a workaround. This could possibly be a question for any windows platform in general but I am running my log files from a Windows 2000 server.
The instructions below contain steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information see How to back up and restore the registry in Windows.
