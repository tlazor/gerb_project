2) Your repeater/router uses the signal received on both antennas to decode the WLAN signal (details depend on the router and protocol). If you asymmetrically boost one antenna, reception may actually get worse, not better.
6) So if you can, the best solution is to use LAN. Either attach the IP camera directly to LAN, or place an access point using a different non-overlapping channel range close to the IP camera (e.g., if the camera is outside), and connect it up via LAN to your main router.
1) By exchanging the antenna, you may exceed the legal maximum transmission power in your country (an additional 6 dBi = four times the wattage). Fines and chances of getting caught depend on your country.
4) Besides signal strength, there are a lot of other factors that influence reception. One very important one is the presence of other Wifi senders on the same channel (note that depending on the protocol, multiple channels are used). In addition, there's the hidden station problem, which becomes worse with increased range, and use of repeaters.
5) Your repeater will have first to receive the data, and then send it again on the same channel, halving available bandwidth.
