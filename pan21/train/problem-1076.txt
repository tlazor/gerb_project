We have a SFTP server which was working fine until we added another ISP. The connection to the SFTP server is not going through the new ISP, I confirmed it with tracert. No change was made on the server either. But since then, some users' SFTP or SSH connections time out/hang if the executed command has a larger return. Here's the scenario:
I believe the commenter hit the nail on the head, this is a classic example of an MTU issue (and path MTU not properly detecting the smaller MTU necessary for that particular path that is failing). You should check that the intermediary devices in the path that is failing are properly allowing MTU path discovery packets through, and that there aren't any intermediary routers with unnecessarily small MTUs. You can probably narrow it down by sending large icmp packets up to the size of MTU to each hop along the way to discover where it is failing (although this doesn't always work).
I ran WireShark on my PC (which is outside of our network and outside of the city), when SFTP/SSH times out, I see retransmission and part of segment not captured errors coming up, which leads me to believe there might be some packet loss somewhere between the hops. 
Is SFTP/SSH that sensitive to packet loss? Wouldn't SSH/SFTP retransmit/reacknowledge to avoid these packet loss errors? Is there something on the server settings I can tweak in order to make this work?
