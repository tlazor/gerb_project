Apache rewrite should be able to do this, but will cost you a DNS lookup for each request the server responds to.  Install a caching DNS server if you don't already have one.  Something light-weight like dnsmasq should be sufficient for a smaller site.  Something like the following should forbid access.  See the URL Rewriting Guide for additional guidance.
Does that work for you? Note: that redirect target may not be the exact message you want to give - you may want to throttle that up or down depending on the full context of the situation.
I have a webserver running OpenSUSE 11.1 and I need to block a URL.  The reason I want to block a URL is because it seems to have a different IP address all the time, but the URL stays the same.
iptables will resolve the name at the time the firewall is loaded.  It won't work for servers with dynamic addresses such as you are encountering.  If the problem site had a static address, you would only need the INPUT rule.  
I'd rather not install any new software, so I was hoping for a way to do this with either IPTABLES or Apache.
