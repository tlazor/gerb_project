It's down to a combination of which platform you'll get the best support from Oracle (or other external support providers) on, and which you're most comfortable with yourselves.
if your server admins knows only Windows (MS-only shop) - you should use Oracle on Windows... or do you want as a DBA to maintain O/S, install O/S patches, handle O/S security, do O/S backups etc etc?
On the other hand, and from the sound of things, your in-house skills are primarily Windows.  Now, you can't be in a position where you're reliant on external support for basic day-to-day operational stuff.  Also, I'd be suspicious of your DBA advocating Linux; OS platforms should be somewhat outside of a DBAs remit.  Based on that alone I'd definitely be leaning towards Windows.
If you pay Oracle's own consultancy group to come in and design a 'turnkey' system for you that involves a DB there's a 98%+ chance that they'll install it on 'Oracle Enterprise Linux', which is their own rebranded version of RHEL.
In my experience Oracle can be very high-maintenance, meaning that the quality of support is utterly crucial.  If you can do it all in-house, more power to you, but it's an utterly huge beast these days, requiring a lot of dedicated resources to get the best out of, so like as not you're going to be calling on external support a bit.  So which platform can you get the best external support on?  I think that would be Linux, but I also think you'll get decent support on Windows.
However, in case of mixed shop, I usually recommend Oracle on Linux for various reasons (some might be subjective):
But anyway, for your developers, accessing Oracle on windows or linux is the same, totally transparent. They should be checking Oracle goodies for .NET either way.
