Considering the fact that if you were able to delete this folder, you would lose the ability to recover your operating system should you need to reinstall... it is understandably difficult to delete.
I'm not sure why you don't want to delete the whole partition, considering that the partition shouldn't really contain anything other than recovery information.  But, if you do want the space, it would be much better to remove the partition completely, and then adjust the space of your primary partition to absorb that left over space.
Use a linux live CD like Ubuntu or Backtrack 5 - once booted it should be straightforward to delete the folder. I normally find though that deleting the partition (in Windows) to get rid of recovery partitions is the easiest way to do this - Use Computer Management - Disk Management to delete the partition - you can then create a new partition or add the space to your existing partition.
If the process still have same error message then I'll recommend you to Unlocker which is much powerful tool to delete the stuff like that. After installing it you can find it by right click on the folder.        
So, unless you have the ability to reinstall Windows without the hard drive recovery, you should find OTHER things to delete to make up that space.
If you do have the ability to install Windows without needing that recovery partition, then one way to delete that partition is to boot to your Windows installation disc, delete all the existing partitions, and install Windows fresh.  Zing!  No Recovery partition.
