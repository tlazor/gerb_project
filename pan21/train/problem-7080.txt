Wanted to answer over at Stackoverflow, but your question was closed to fast, glad you moved it here.
Try changing the permissions of the directory from where you serve your files to drwx--x--x (that's 711). This way the web server will be able to "cd" to this directory and read the php file (providing it has read permissions to it)
Now everything should be fine for anything that you execute with nginx, PHP, and php-fpm and that's below /var/www.
Because you're running the php as a cgi, it probably needs the a +x for the group on the .php files, which it probably doesn't have int he normal case. And it doesn't that for displaying the .html, which is obviously only read, not executed.
Primary script unknown is reported by php-fpm and almost always a problem with the path that you pass (from nginx) to php-fpm. The process simply can't find any PHP file at that location. In your case it can't find the file because the php-fpm process doesn't have permissions to read the file. That's right, you don't need any execution permissions for a PHP script (unless it's a CLI entry point). The reason for this is simple, PHP scripts are not executed, they are parsed (read).
It's generally a good idea to use the same user/group for nginx, PHP, and php-fpm if it's your server and nobody else is messing around. Then apply the following permissions (assuming /var/www as root for all websites, which is best practice imho):
