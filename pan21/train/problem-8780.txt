Check the system log, do you have a bunch of asp.net errors for bad viewstate?  Weird encryption errors?  I dont know if WSS catches thos ebefore they hit that log or not, in many .net apps it is not caught and can be seen in the event viewer.
Perhaps this is because the auth is bad on each request if you need a stateful connection.  I have seen similar things when the load balancer is setup to use round robin.  What happens is the ViewState on WSS is authenticated for a server, and the viewstate is encrypted using the machine key.  If these keys are not synced on all the servers in the group the view state will be bad, and force a re-authentication... this will keep happening until 2 or 3 requests to the same server happen.  The first request is not authorized (request 1), we know this because its a new user, so the next request sends the auth (request 2) and the next sends the request that was sent on request 1 but with a good viewstate (request 3).  If at any time in this chain of requests you are sent to another server, it starts over.
