Open source IPSEC solutions like Open Swan running on any old linux machine will definitely do the trick. There have been several people on the Open Swan mailing list that have posted questions about doing this and eventually succeeded. Expect a complex setup process though and you'll need to be/become familiar with some lower-level network details (or pay a consultant) to be successful.
Otherwise try getting a Mikrotik router to work. They can also handle the local routing nicely, as well as more compelx scenarios. I have 3 in use so far (office, data center, external project office) and will add nother 2 next month (another project office and a data center we build) and the prie / power combo is VERY hard to beat.
I realize there are probably free VPN gateways (Vyatta comes to mind) but being that I'm not a VPN ninja, just looking for the easiest, nearly cut-n-paste way to get the connection set up, then just add the routing entries on our LAN to get started.
I need to prototype a solution using Amazon VPC - what's the least expensive option available to create a VPC gateway on our side for the test lab?
What router do you have available in your test lab?  Early in our evaluation of VPC I was wondering the same thing, and realised that our router (which is a Juniper, running ScreenOS) is on the Amazon approved list, so it was straight-forward; more-so that I would have thought, anyway.  Failing that, you're back to  Wes' answer above, i.e. software solutions like OpenSwan.
