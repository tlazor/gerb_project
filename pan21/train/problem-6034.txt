So I let my brother log in his account, sign out, turn the PC off, turn it on again, log in my account. Same problem, his account is already signed in. Without even entering the password.
The same happens if he is the one to login first after booting, he sees me already signed in. If I switch account to mine, I can clearly see that my startup programs are already started and ready.
Since the recent Fall Creators Update I'm facing a strange behavior while using Windows 10. My brother and I are using different accounts, both protected by password. When I turn on my PC and sign in, an automatic startup program (the Blizzard Launcher) warns me that it can't start since another user on the same computer is using that app. I thought that it was impossible, my brother's account can't be active if I just turned my PC on.
You may also need to change the settings that turn shutting off into hibernate. Windows 10 will go to hibernation instead of shutdown even if you disabled it and asked to shutdown.
