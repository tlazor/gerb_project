Considering that it was a relatively simple case, an md device working as single physical device for a LVM volume linearly allocated, and that wraps a single ext4 fs, my solution was to go directly after the ext4 fs and mount it as a loop filesystem for the time necessary to the recovery.
So only the linux-raid superblock got corrupted, but that is not that difficult to restore (especially if you have other devices in that array intact). 
Supposing that there is no other read failure in the rest of the disk, would I be able to recover this 900 GB partition (as I mentioned before, it's a 'linux raid autodetect' partition, that contains a a LVM2 volume that contains a ext4 filesystem) if I copy-clone the partition somewhere else, but the first 4kB?
I do have backup for most of the contents, but not for the very last changes, and if possible, I'd like to recover that from this failing disk.
If your mdadm which created the array is < v.3.0, than the payload starts in offset 0x22000 (and further up if it is v.3.0 or later), which as well before the deleted first 4KB.
