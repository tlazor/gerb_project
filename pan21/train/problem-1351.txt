I think your first step is to locate what information is available within Windows about this array, or about the physical drives. I'd imagine that the logical drive appears as a single physical drive to the OS?
Use one of these tools to see if any information about this array or the physical drives has been exposed to the OS. 
Third, remote desktop is your friend.  I realize this isn't a good way to get a notification on disk failure, but it will let you login to locally look at the drive configs with something like Adaptec Storage Manager.
First is that Windows MMC will allow you to remote into the machine and connect to the Virtual Disk Service on that machine.  This would let you look at any windows managed volumes.  Though this probably won't help you as only the Windows accessable Virtual Disk will show up, not the Physical Disk as managed by the RAID controller.  But Remotely managing the machine will let you into the event manager as well and Adaptec's drivers do "tend" to write to the event logs, so you would have a place to go poke around if needed.
Microsoft has WMI Explorer tools, but this is kind of a needle in the haystack using a gui.  If you can get a VBscript to dump the classes (Rob Vanderwoude has one here), you can use WMIC.exe using the command line format of wmic.exe path [wmi path] get /format:list 
I haven't used it for email notifications but I believe it and the RST console have that email option.
Another thought:  Have you ever simply removed one of the drives from the running system?  Did it update the system event log in any way?  Did the registry change, perhaps around key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\Scsi?
You can use Windows 2008 event notification to monitor RAID failure reports. Check out http://www.whiz-tech.com/blog/2013/01/01/how-to-setup-e-mail-alerts-for-intel-ichr-raid-failure-monitor-applies-to-windows-2008-server-windows-7 to see an example.
Secondly would be to look into the SNMP feature in 2008.  You might discover that there is a MIB for monitoring that controller in there somewhere.  (It's worth a look).  You can turn on the SNMP Service under "Server Manager"->"Features->Add Feature->SNMP Services.  It will install it as a system service which can them be configed under "Services" in Administrative Tools.
You could try this software if the drives support SMART: http://www.panterasoft.com/ (see HDD monitor)
You could also get the Intel Storage Matrix Manager = http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&DwnldID=17882&keyword=ich10r+console&lang=eng
If you can locate information about the drives or the array, you should be able to figure out a way to update Opennms.
Or like Mike said, since the Storage Matrix manager fires off events to the eventvwr, you could use the feature in 08 R2 to grab those events and forward them via email or since you use OpenNMS you can grab the events http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Windows_Event_Log_Traps.
Just thought of a 4th option.  IN 2008 R2 there is a feature in Event Logs that allows you to run apps/send emails based on thrown events in windows.  You could use this to notify you of a failure.
