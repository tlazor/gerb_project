You can't do the same thing in Firefox as Firefox 3.5's "Private Browsing" mode is more of a toggle, it closes and saves your main session first.
Sandboxie would probably work along the same lines as ThinApp or Browser Sandbox. People often use it to maintain a clean browser "image" that can be reset. 
Internet Explorer 8's "Private Browsing mode" gives you a totally independent session with no shared cookies or other login details. That gets you two sessions (albeit in two different windows, rather than tabs) out of the box.
This would not only give you discrete sessions, but the possibility of entirely different setups for different purposes.
If you have more than one user account set up on your machine you could do a Run As on Firefox to open a second (third, etc) window up as a brand new Windows user, this would get you totally independent windows with independent sessions, but again in different windows. 
I do something "cheap" in Firefox - I have two GMail accounts and I keep one in a Firefox tab and a second in a Firefox tab using IETab. 
Then you get a new browser session, which will not use the same session as the one logged into gmail.
And I don't think the Private Tab addon was mentioned yet. It seems to create the same effect as separate private browsing windows, but in neighboring tabs.
You could run two (or more) entirely independent and physically differentiated instances using Firefox Portable. Just extract the program to two (or more) locations, edit \Other\Source\FirefoxPortable.ini to read AllowMultipleInstances=**True**, and you have two functionally independent Firefox browsers.
