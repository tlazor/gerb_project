It would depend on the size of the event. The event causes a huge magnet wave, which could induce current to flow in any electrical carriers. That means the power grid, phone lines etc. But it would also de-gauss magnetic storage if strong enough. A faraday cage under your basement is likely the best option for an individual. 
NB: Physics/Electrical Engineering could give a much more technical answer than my laymans summation here. 
Realistically though you wouldn't care. No power, no water, no communications. Food shortages after a few months. Losing a few JPGs would be the least of your worries. 
A flare powerful enough to overwrite your HDD will alter Earth's magnetic field badly enough to let solar radiation through. So before you even start worrying about data integrity, you should build a solenoid which would provide magnetic field around your house (or in your basement), and an electric generator to power it.
For  extreme protection you would build a shielded bunker and place it near to the equator where the wave would be felt the least.
Since I have a hard time taking this question seriously, I'm going to suggest you use core memory for the most important data:
Optical media will work, but since the life of optical media is limited, you will need to refresh every few years or ideally, months.  As with any good backup plan, you should never depend on one copy in one location - e.g. treat a 100-stack of discs as 25 x 4 copies each and make sure all are in separate locations as spread-out as possible.  
Seriously, read the article you linked to carefully. White House is not preparing for data damage. They prepare to handle the loss of satellites, telecom equipment, power grids, radiation hazards etc.
