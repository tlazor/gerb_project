Excel charts work by plotting rows and columns of data, not just a big long row. So arrange your data like this:
Now comes the magic of Tables. If you have a formula somewhere that relies on the whole column in a table, then if you add or remove rows in the table, the formula will update without any effort on your part. These formulas include the Series formulas in the chart. So add a row to the table, and the chart will automatically include the new row of data.
The Table now has special formatting, with a colorful header row and alternating bands of color. It's a little overformatted, but you can select it and choose a less (or more!) formatted style.
Select this range of data, and on the Insert ribbon tab, click Table. It won't insert anything, but it will convert your ordinary range of data into a special data structure known as a Table. Nothing to be scared of, Tables are pretty powerful. The dialog will ask if your range has headers, which it does (Week, A, B, C, Total).
