It's possible it's passing through someone's internal network, over MPLS or something similar, where they're using internal IPs.
RFC1918 addresses (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16) should not appear in global routing tables, as they're designed to be used within "a single enterprise". However, it makes sense, to some extent, using RFC1918 addresses for your point-to-point links within your core, even if the traffic going across those links are for "globally routable" IP address ranges, as this conserves a slightly scarce resource.
The reason it shows up in the traceroute is that the TTL of an IP frame expired on an interface with that as its interface IP. The down-side of doing this is that it gets harder to ping the interface and do some troubleshooting on the issue, but there is no guarantee that you should be able to do that anyway.
I saw it happening on some juniper routers. They had proper public ip addresses assigned but router was sending icmp responses with private ip that was bound to management interface (not reachable from public internet).
I agree with Cian. Sometimes these WAN Hops have a loopback private IP address. For some reason this is returned in the tracert. A program called Wireshark (really good freeware) might give you more insight into your networking problem.
