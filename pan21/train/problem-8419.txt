In the given example, 192.168.0.aaa and 192.168.0.ccc are two interfaces on a single device, likewise for .bbb and .ccc. The ccc and ddd represent WiFi cards assigned IPs via DHCP, whereas aaa and bbb are direct Ethernet cable connections on static IPs. The former broadcasts the hostname, but the latter does not. I intend to disable the wireless interfaces shortly.
You didn't say where aaa and bbb connect to, but as they also have 192.168.0.* addresses, that means you intend them to be in the same subnet controlled by the DHCP and DNS server for ccc and ddd, which means that server should also get name entries for them (if it's a home router, often you can configure static addresses with names).
It is convenient for me to see hostnames in the router, via nmap, and in other places rather than referring to these devices strictly as their IPs. I understand I could set up a DNS server for this purpose, but am not quite there yet.
So when nmap scans 192.168.0.ccc, it does a reverse DNS lookup of 192.168.0.ccc, and the DNS server answers with hostname1. 
Computers in a network don't "broadcast" their hostname. What happens in your setup is very likely that whoever assigns your ccc and ddd (BTW, 192.168.*.* is a private subnet, so you can use the full address; no need to keep these IPs secret) address via DHCP also acts as an DNS server, which includes the ability to do reverse lookups.
