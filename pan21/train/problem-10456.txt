I have fitted the Accelero L2 Pro to the ASUS EAH5770 CUCore/2DI/1GD5 (HD 5770) it works great and keeps the card a lot cooler around 50 degrees C while gaming and the GPU clocked at 930 MHz.
To get the cooler to fit snugly I didn't use the supplied spacers and reused the stock spring loaded screws.
Check newegg. They seem to have a ton. Just make sure there aren't any compatibility issues: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=gpu+cooler&x=0&y=0
Arctic Cooling are very good coolers. I've fitted two separate ones on cards I've owned in the past and the temperatures have always been about 20-30 degrees cooler than the stock cooler. So, personally, I'd get that cooler and fit it :)
Your 5770 is most likely a ducted fan. I won't link to exactly which one you should buy, but if you search google shopping for ati 5770 gpu fan you should find lots of ducted fans on ebay for less than $25
P.S. Oh and compressed air is crap. Best thing to use is a dry paintbrush and a standard hoover. Just make sure the fans dont spin when you're cleaning it as it can send a charge back into the motherboard.
