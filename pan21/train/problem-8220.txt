Take a look at using AutoHotKey to assign a macro to the mouse button and in the macro script, use this function to switch windows to the Discord window. 
Is there a way how I can apply a similar line of batch code to a tray icon? Is there a directory where the tray applications are stored? Like below:
I have a Corsair M65 Pro FPS Gaming Mouse and I want to macro opening the Discord tray icon to my mouse. Why the tray icon of discord? When you press the tray icon for discord in Windows, it doesn't create a new instance of the application. Discord only minimizes to the tray, rather than the taskbar. I have discord already pinned to my taskbar, and if I want to maximize discord by the taskbar (or icon on desktop), it creates a new instance, which takes a couple of seconds to load. I want to switch the window open just by the press of my macro key on my mouse. I already have a similar macro to my mouse that is linked to a batch file that validates with steam and opens CSGO. The code for that batch file is below.
