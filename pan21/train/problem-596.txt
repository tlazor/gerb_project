When we buy from companies that don’t sell directly, we usually talk to a large company like Dell or CDW. If you are a small or medium business, someone like Dell can give you an account representative who can help you find the products you need, but rarely has them on their website for online purchase. CDW does let you order online, but that doesn’t help you in France. There must be a similar large reseller in France.
Suggestion: don't bother with their site for pricing or as the definitive source of what they carry.  Call them up, get a business rep and have them put together quotes for you.  
Basically find a reseller is the way.  Typically a reputable large telco should be in a position to either give you a deal or - if not - point you in the direction of someone who can.  Maybe approach your ISP or bandwidth provider as a first port of call.  They're already getting money off you, and in today's economy they should be interested in keeping you sweet, plus they are a provider rather than a security company, so you should be able to avoid a lot of grief.
CDW will sell you Cisco stuff (at least they have always been able to provide the parts/licenses/support contracts) that companies I have been with have needed.  
The other alternative is to talk to your ISP or colocation provider. For us, AT&T can usually get us networking equipment at decent prices.
