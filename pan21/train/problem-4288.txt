And have set up a LAN between them. Sharing files works fine, except the Windows XP Laptop cannot access the Windows 7 Desktop; It asks for login credientals. So:
One difference between the XP laptop and desktop is that the desktop is XP Professional where the laptop is Home, I believe. Could it simply lack Pro's "anonymous" network access capability? Or is there something I'm missing? Am I forced to create a login on the Win7 to grant access to the laptop?
By "access" do you mean network shares? (The "desktop" usually means what you see on the monitor.) And which version of Windows 7?
With XP Home, the only way to share is through the guest account, which should be enabled on Windows 7 and have the permissions to access the shares. It is the same as using Simple File Sharing in XP Pro. 
As far as I can tell all systems have identical and correct network settings. I don't understand why the Win7 machine can access the laptop but not the other way around. Or why the desktop can but the laptop cannot.
