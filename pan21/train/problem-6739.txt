* An IDR (instantaneous decoding refresh) picture in H.264 is a picture that consists only of intra-coded slices and does not require other pictures to be decoded. The decoder can only start decoding once it receives an IDR picture. Roughly speaking, you could call it a keyframe, although technically it's not the same.
Concatenating might result in choppy video. I've personally been avoiding cutting with bitstream copies whenever I can. I don't think you'll be able to find out exactly where it will cut off, but it's definitely at some keyframe. 
You could try specifying -ss before -i, which will make ffmpeg seek to keyframes only, and thus produce an output bitstream that should display video right away.
Basically if you use -ss after -i, ffmpeg will seek to the timestamp, regardless if it's a keyframe or not. It'll then write the output stream from there, but the player can only start from the next IDR picture*, so this is why you experience black video until the decoder can start displaying something.
