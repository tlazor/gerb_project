Sadly, I have to use all three mechanisms, since there isn't a one-size fits all solution for all Cisco HW / SW permutations, unless Cisco NCS can do it... I haven't tried NCS yet, so I can't say.
RANCID goes out and logs into all of your devices [launched via cron] grabs config/inventory, places it in a source control system and emails you config/inventory diffs. (This would catch any hardware moving around)
You can set up the basic Zenoss monitoring server, it's supports Cisco Devices information gathering via SNMP. This provides a lot of information just by adding an IP (like: IOS version, interfaces + IP configuration, ...)
Since this is all kept in a revision control system you can look back to see when a module was added or removed.
Switchmap is SNMP-based, but it might be worth taking a look at for building inventories of equipment, modules, etc.
Using RANCID for inventory tracking isnt all that pretty though. I just grep what I am looking for from the config/inventory archive.
I run python scripts to parse inventory (for the same platforms) on a daily basis... The best options I have found are parsing CLI show inventory, "show mod" (for platforms that don't support show inventory), and polling ENTITY-MIB.
Something like RANCID might help you out here. Plus, if you don't do config management it would take care of that for you as well.
