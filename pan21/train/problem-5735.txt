By setting the rights on directories, removing the 'x', the Windows Explorer appears to be creating the folder then trying to access it.  As Peter points out, it tried a total of 4 times.
You may need to do some chmod if the permissions themselves are borked.  In which case, you'd have to write:
Where xxx is whatever permissions value you want.  Again, mimic what was there before unless you know what it is supposed to be.
"New Folder" command (from windows explorer) creates 4 folders on Windows 10 Pro - July 2016 release. This issue however doesn't occur on Windows 10 Enterprise or on Windows 10 Pro - July 2015 release. Steps to reproduce:
Right click on the top folder > Go to Security settings > Advance > select the user/ group and check the permission. tick the box for Delete. Apply and OK.
The issue occurs when the top directory has deny permission for Delete and Delete folders and files.
This happened on my machine due to me fiddling with some permissions with Cygwin and on my dual boot system that could access the same files on both OS's.  It is possible to get the permissions back to the way it was via Cygwin or Bash for Windows (or something similar).  I had write something like below for whatever folders that had this issue.  Not sure which folders exactly you are having problems with, but it would be good to mimic what was there before (unless you have an idea what you need to change the owning user to)
I had this problem, and discovered it was because I was fiddling with the creation rights in the /etc/samba/smb.conf file.  I was trying to stop it from setting the eXecute bit on new files.
If anyone searches and finds this as part of a Linux/Samba/Share, here is the issue (which was self induced).
