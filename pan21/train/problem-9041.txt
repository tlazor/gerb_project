I too have found this to be the case.  You have to assign maintenance windows or the updates will apply whenever they feel like it.
As for server updates, what I have been doing is deploying updates as available to servers but then logging in and manually applying them (after taking a snapshot of the machine if it is a VM).
Why not just make your deployment "available" rather than "required"? That way the updates will appear in Software Center but not automatically install.
Actually the maintenance window of the CLIENT will be the sum of whatever maintenance windows are applied to it. So if you have a one-hour maintenance window applied through membership in one collection, and the client is also a member of a collection with NO maintenance window defined, your effective maintenance window is one hour.
Lots of confusing half-truth answers here.  Those settings you've circled only apply if a machine has a maintenance window applied.  If you want your systems to never reboot unless you initiate it, then you should make a maintenance window either far in the future, or one far in the past.  
"An additional gotcha is that if a machine is a member of more than one collection that have Deployments targeted to them, and one of those collections does not have a maintenance window defined, the maintenance windows of the other collections are effectively ignored."
Without a maintenance Window, SCCM will allow a system to restart after installing updates.  The way to block that behavior is under SCCM Client Settings, found under Administration -> Client Settings.
It appears this might be a known bug in SCCM. I can't, however, find any MS documentation, but @ least the OP knows the problem doesn't lie in his setup.
What would be nice however is an "install all updates during the next maintenance window, rebooting if necessary" button so that I can initiate this process during the day then get up early and make sure I don't have to roll the snapshot back.
