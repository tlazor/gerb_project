If you do not care about traffic from Network 2 reaching Network 3 and vice versa (shown below) you can try this solution.
Select the three network interfaces you want to connect, click with your right mouse button and select Bridge Connections.
Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (or six depending on your preference). Double click that or select Properties.
If you don't know your routers IP address or gateway etc. you can find that out by opening a command prompt (cmd) and entering ipconfig /all.
Switch to tab Alternate Configuration and enter your data depending on your setup. The most important is that you enter the correct Default Gateway, because that is the "door" your network traffic needs to reach the internet. The IP address you need to enter there is most likely the same IP your router has. If you're unsure about your DNS Servers it (again) is most likely your routers IP address. You should not have to enter a IP address for yourself (or Subnet mask) but you can. 
You should see another adapter appear named Network Bridge. Right click this device and select Properties to configure it.
