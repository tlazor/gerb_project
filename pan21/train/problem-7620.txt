Cron couldn't get to the server itself thanks to some DNS issues, so the IP I gave it didn't do anything. It's now functioning without so much as a hiccup. 
'site' is the template group name within EE. This is hitting its index page. For right now its just an IP with no name to resolve to (this is beyond my control, in someone else's hands). 
There is also the .htaccess file performing rewrites to make the URL less verbose, does this interfere with Cron?
The goal is easy, have Cron hit a url on my server every 5 minutes. All of that is set up and functions fine, the issue is that it times out when accessing it. Anyone with a browser can, at the moment, reach it however. 
The Cron script I wrote doesn't do anything fancy, nor does it need to, and simply has to hit off every 5 minutes. 
I'm sure this is simple and I've been digging but no answer is quite as specific as I need it to be. 
Per usual, the devil is in the details. It is an ExpressionEngine site and, therefore, is PHP. Does this mess with Cron?
