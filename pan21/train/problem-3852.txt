I have no experience with anything but Windows file shares, but since you have AD I would think the route to go would be to get a Windows file server.  You can then lock down the file shares based on user and AD group membership.  Even though some users don't authenticate to AD when they log into their workstations, they should be prompted for credentials when trying to access the file share and then would have to authenticate using their AD credentials.
If there is a need to restrict access to file shares at all within the company based on department/need-to-know, then subnet restriction is not going to do it.  Even if you set up something that does "restrict" access to a particular share based on subnet, you have no authentication or authorization mechanisms to determine if the access is being performed by a user in that department who should be accessing the file share or not.  Somebody could either just plop down a machine (a work machine or an outside machine) in that subnet and access the share unrestricted essentially.
I have a situation where there are three subnets within a building. Each subnet essentially isolates separate units within this group. In looking at different options for a file server, I am trying to research if it is possible to setup a single file server to support all three subnets. What I am unsure of is how to restrict which directories can be viewed based on which subnet the request is coming from or if it is possible (though, with it being 2013, I expect it probably can). It is a mixed environment with end users having OSX or Windows 7 and the total number of users across all three subnets is less than 250, averaging 130 any given day. There is no established OS baseline for servers, though I am attempting to migrate as much as possible to CentOS as replacement time comes around.
