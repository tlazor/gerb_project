Something purely ActionScript that you can do is store your data in objects which are listed in an array, example:
I would create an XML or other file to look into, instead of writing all those content related conditions yourself. I think its better to separate content and logic in this case.
In lot of cases it would be better to load the XML external, but for the example this will work too.
You need to store data properly to be able to use it efficiently. What you're doing there is storing all the data within an endless amount of if() statements.
Since your if-else statements follow a simple logic (ALL the strings are expected EQUAL to something you know), you can simply concatenate the values and use them as keys in a lookup table (for convenience, I created one for you, but this can and should be done at runtime):
Then I would find a node matching all content using a E4X expression. Basically there is one condition; just match 3 fields in the XML.
I would suggest storing everything as XML, but not knowing your experience level I'll avoid that solution.
