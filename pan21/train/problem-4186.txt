I had the same story, many laptops couldn't connect to the wifi. It was an EnGenius ECB300 router. Even right next to the router it would reject the connection: "Checking network requirements" and then ... "Can't connect to this network".
But I found the reason.  The router running on Channel 11 did not allow any connection to these wifi adaptors, but when I changed the router's channel to channel 1 for example, then they connect totally fine.
So, it might be that either the router or the AR956x wifi chips can't operate at the highest end of the wifi channel spectrum and therefore fail.  So check what channel the routers are running at and try a lower one.
The problem was hardware related, my hinges of laptop are weak, because of which the WiFi antenna cable which runs around the display screen got damaged. So, that's why I am able to see network but not able to connect to them.
I narrowed it down to being only from laptops with Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapters.  I tried newer drivers where available, but still, could not connect.
