This may be a strange advice, but check if you didn't leave any removable media (cd, dvd, sd card) that could have personal/important files.
I actually remove the hard drive before disposing of the rest of the computer, and then keep the hard drive in a cupboard for a year before then disposing of that. Very often people have asked for data from the hard drive after the machine has gone.
Sometimes license stickers are glued in computer cases (Like windows). If you have these licenses related to you somehow in other integrated systems, it's a good idea to remove them.
If you are planning on recycling them, then I think destroying them (physically) is good enough as long as it's for sure not possible to somehow fix the hard drive.
Since I don't have NASA files in my machine, DBAN is a good choice. :) If you're REALLY paranoid about data and don't know what people would do to your machine, make them sign a responsibility paper that you gave away a complete formatted drive, so if they find "suspicious files" in your HD, you're safe.
I'd say before wiping it or anything, make sure you can't salvage any of the parts first.  U can always turn an old computer into a headless server, or a home theater PC, or something.  I mean you'll most likely need to give it some upgrades, but it doesn't need to get thrown away.
