The problem comes when things get shifted do to repairs or testing. Over time as the number of units have increased it is getting harder to manage each station as replacing a computer or printer requires a lot of reconfiguration.
But of course if you are using multiple VLANs for each pair, the primary DHCP scopes must be separate for each VLAN and the DHCP setup will be the tricky part here since, you either need to have a VLAN interface and a DHCP helper/relay IP on each primary subnet for each VLAN.
Right now each PC and printer has an manually assigned network IP address. The installed printer drivers have ports assigned to the printer for that particular line and spare printer.
Your scenario seems plausible and possible. The switch should not have issues with the same subnet being used on multiple VLANs because it doesn't even look at the "Subnet" or Layer 3 contents of the frames. Its job is to just forward frames into their proper broadcast domains.
Configure pairs of ports on the switch to separate VLANs so that each pair share the same 192.168.1.0 subnet. The means that the printer on port 2 and the printer on port 4 do not overlap because they are on separate VLANs but have the same address. We do not expect to be able to reach the printers from outside their paired PC.
This question is meant to determine if it this is a valid feature of smart manged switches or is strictly a routing problem.
Each station consists of a very small form factor Windows 7/10 PC and an Ethernet printer. The PC has a single Ethernet port and cannot be easily expanded to two.
