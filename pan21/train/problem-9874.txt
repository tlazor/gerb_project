You can also use Mondo Rescue to clone your installation. It will create a bootable CD/clone of your installation and you can use that to install ther servers using it. I have used it and it works very well. Here's a howto:
But this only helps initial set up; you might wish to look into managing your configuration with puppet or chef. This lets you deploy and re-deploy servers or desktops with given configurations over and over again without much extra effort.
The usual answer to this sort of problem is to get a basic system installed as quickly as possible with as little manual intervention, then run the same apt-get install ... commands on all machines to get the packages synchronized on all of them. A local package mirror is an excellent way to improve installation speed on the other machines, and provides an easy place to store / distribution site-local packages.
If this is a long term thing, where you might need to install more computer or perhaps re-installed computer, you should maybe think about using the debian/ubuntu preseeding capabilities.
This will give you the option to recreate the same configuration time and time again, with no need to run through any installation steps.
An excellent (if potentially dated, at this point) introduction to managing multiple machines is hosted by our friends at infrastructures.org.
