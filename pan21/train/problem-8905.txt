The only authentication that I'm aware of in PIX OS relates to authenticating users for VPN or administrative sessions.
You can use hacks that products like Websense or the Barracuda filtering appliances use to monitor Windows domain controllers and keep an internal "state table" of user sessions associated with client device IP addresses. Terminal Server computers will play hell with this, though. Any devices that don't perform Windows domain authentication will be "invisible" (in terms of the user associated with the client device's IP address) to such hackery, too.
That aside, the only way to do the things you describe in item 1 ("I mean ALL internet access (games, telnet, ...), not just HTTP.") is going to involve a shim in the TCP/IP stack on all the client devices (much like the "Firewall Client" that Microsoft ISA Server uses), since per-user authentication information isn't carried around in IP datagrams, TCP segments, etc. Getting that to work with your embedded clients ("iphone, android") is going to be pretty tough. If you want per-user authentication of all protocol usage, though, that's really the only route.
The PIX can generate per-NAT-translation statistics similiar to what you're looking for via SYSLOG, but there won't be any per-user authentication. You'll also have to code something to parse the log data or purchase a third-party parsing product.
