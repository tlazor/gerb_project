I am trying to find a way to monitor my apache server so I can see which domain is causing slow down on my server when they occur.  I was hoping I would be able to do it with ApacheTop but I have to list our each log file separately as Plesk splits domains apache logs into individual files.
Attach multiple domain access logs to the same apachetop process, and get a total overview of whats happening in real time. You can specific multiple access logs using this syntax :
I was hoping someone would come up with a fancy way to tracking domains down.  The method I've been using is to enable mod_fcgid and make all PHP sites run under it.  This means that PHP scripts using a lot of CPU time show up in the process table & top.  Also I check the mysql processlist to see sites that have databases and if they are also using a lot of CPU time.
I suppose you could possibly use ApacheTop by making a custom log rule in the apache configuration file to log all sites to a single access_log.  This should be possible without affecting the normal logging of the sites.
