I've been through the Sound control panel. The correct microphone is selected as the default communication device. The microphone level is set to 100. The microphone is plugged into a sound card, so I uninstalled the audio card (an Asus D1) driver and reinstalled it which made no difference. If I tap the microphone, it does register 5 or 6 green bars in the recording volume monitor. So, does anybody have any suggestions on where to look next?
I had that problem when I was plugging my mic in, I had a prompt asking me if it's was a "line in" or a "mic". Every time I chose "Mic", it wasn't really working. I tried to chose "line in" and to my surprise it worked! :)
Hi i had this issue with a podcast mic, I've not checked to see if your question was answered, but all I did was make sure windows was up to date (which it wasn't) and two I went into the microphone properties and went to the advanced tab made sure the two options under exclusive mode were "unchecked" three, I made sure the microphone levels were turned up including the boost slider.
I have got a reasonbly basic desktop microphone, however for reasons that I don't understand it is extremley quiet. I dual boot, both systems run Windows 7, one system is working just fine although the other system, after I restarted the computer a couple of weeks ago, the microphone is now far too quiet.
I was having this issue and managed to solve it by simply changing where I had my mic plugged into.  At first I had my mic plugged into my front panel audio which is plugged into my sound card.  When I plugged my mic into the sound card directly the volume was much better.  This may not be the issue you are having, but it is definitely worth testing.
