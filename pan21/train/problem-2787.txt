/dev/sdc is the full usb device, you cant mount it. You need to mount something like /dev/sdc1 (first partition) /sev/sdc2 (second partition), etc. The filesystem is autodetected, but  you need to add the mount point, for example:
mount should detect the filesystem automatically in most cases. Your USB drive may be partitioned which is why sdc won't mount. Try the following:
However it seams you are asking the wrong question for your problem. Which is, "how do I install a driver for NetworkCard XY on debian (Version X) from CD or USB" ;-)
Even USB drives are usually partitioned like hard drives, so you'll want to check ls /dev/sdc*. You'll probably see a /dev/sdc1. As many others have said, you'll find that mount usually detects the right filesystem. Mounting /dev/sdc directly is failing because you're trying to mount the partition table as a filesystem. Mounting with -t usbfs worked because virtual filesystem mounts ignore the source argument.
When mounting with -t usbfs, the source doesn't matter. usbfs is a DevFS virtual filesystem. Its contents are points to various devices.
