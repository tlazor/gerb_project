My server has Broadcom NetExtreme NICs, so it seems for me the cause of this issue was definitely driver related, but setting DisableTaskOffload = 1 resolved the issue completely for me. Hope that this information saves someone else hours of searching!
On the network adapter properties for the VM guest, have you disabled Jumbo Packets and Large Send Offload?  Based on my experience with these settings, I would definitely try it.  
After a call to Microsoft and several dump/log file uploads later, they determined that TrendMicro OfficeScan was the culprit in our case.  We were using a version that turned out to not be explicitly supported on Hyper-V, once we upgraded to the latest release, the problem went away.
I have run into something similar in a much simpler Hyper-V environment, and ran across this article at Microsoft.  Seems to fit with your situation if the web servers are heavily used.

I am aware that this is an old question, but I encountered the same issue and wasted so much time getting it resolved that I thought I would share the solution that worked for me. I found the solution to my problem here:
The solution in my situation was to disable TCP Offloading on the VMs. I will quote the relevant section from the link:
We had this same problem, though in our case it was every 24-48 hours.  I would double-check that your antivirus/firewall product spcefically supports Server 2008 with Hyper-V, if not, try a different (or temporarily removing if feasible) your anti-virus/firewall product as a test to see if the issue goes away.
