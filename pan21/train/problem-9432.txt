I am pretty sure there a similar questions but None of them really helped me and I have restricted Internet-Access (for example I can't Access badlogicgames.com).
Right now my LevelScreen contains a Background-Actor which is pan-able and some zones to buy Towers - after buying them you can upgrade them further.
I am looking for a way of letting some Actors stay relative to Screen while moving some Actors with the world while panning around.
When you click a Zone or a Tower, a small overlay on the bottom appears (another actor) - click it to buy. 
It's the solution i'm using, and for me it's working fine. Assuming that by "couldn't access" you meant you couldn't handle input, you have to know there is a solution for this : InputMultiplexer.
My main Problem was that the overlay stayed where you clicked and didn't move when you pan the Screen.
I am now only able to fire the touchDown Event on these actors when I pan to the bottom left of the Screen and click where the Actor's Icon is.
I set it backwards for further Actors who should stay where they are - Towers for example - but I kinda don't know what I am really doing.
