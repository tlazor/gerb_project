At the same time, I don't want to connect the USB HDD to any of this device physically which will require one of the connected machines to be running all the time. Instead, I need a solution like in recent times there are USB external HDD with wireless capabilities, so is there something like an wireless adapter to which I can connect my HDD so that it is available all the time?
I am trying to connect my external USB powered USB hard drives (1TB) and various other capacities of USB HDD containing various media files including videos and music on my home wireless network. I want to access this from any of my devices including my Android Phone, Tablet, my Mac or from my Windows 8 Laptop.
If you want to re-use your old external HDD, then MonkeyZeus' answer is the correct path. Get a NAS box that has USB support (Netgear ReadyNAS, Synology, QNAP, and lots of other brand out there), and use that.
To add to MonkeyZeus' answer, you can also get something like Seagate Wireless Plus which is basically a Wireless NAS. It won't accept your current external HDD of course, but you can copy your content into it and it will do the job.
