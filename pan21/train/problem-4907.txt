I had this same problem just now and came across the above suggestions.  In my case i am another person with a messy desk. Also, i work on a laptop plugged inot a KVM switch.  I had an external 3.5" USB drive in a small enclosure temporarily plugged into the laptop and resting on the touchpad.  Apparently the internal movement of the hard drive was being detected by the touchpad and causing the problem.  One more possibility to watch out for that could cause this problem.
I've solved it.  It's fair to say that my office is in a bit of a mess at the moment whilst we redecorate another room.  I have a Wacom Bamboo tablet which I hardly use these days.  It'd fallen down the back of the desk and my laptop PSU had landed on top of it.  
Here's how I solved my problem with the mouse pointer.  Windows 7 users. I went into Device Manager, clicked on Mouse and uninstalled the hardware.  Then I rebooted the computer.  When it came back up again the problem was fixed and I haven't had any trouble since then.
Uninstalling the mouse hardware did not work for me. I went into device manager and uninstalled the USB drivers and then rebooted. That seems to have solved the problem. 
I was going through the unplug-everything-one-by-one routine.  I'd already tried unplugging the mouse as soon as the problem manifested itself but that didn't help.  I was going through the USB cables, unplugged one and it stopped.  When I plugged it back in, it started again.  I followed the cable and found the long-forgotten tablet, with the PSU sat on top of it.  As soon as I moved the PSU, it stopped.  With a bit of trial-and-error I found that it didn't need to be in contact to cause the problem.
