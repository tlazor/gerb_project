Good point. Good for you that you think about security of configs in particular. The answer is it depends (as usual). For e. g., if you have exim running in its own OpenVZ/LXC/Docker/KVM/XEN/PhysicalServer ergh... let's call it "scope", you can bother not, probably, as except root there wouldn't be anyone who could peek into this config.
Is there any reason why this file can't be made only readable by root?  I wonder why it wouldn't default to that given the possibility of it containing sensitive information.  Does anyone know?
At contrary, if the "scope" is shared with different not-that-trusted users (unlikely, if you're pro-secure admin), file permissions can be considered important, no doubts.
The solution I can propose is using group-access for that purpose. Make sure exim user is a member of some group you choose to have READ-access to the config file, set group access permission to "read-only" and, in theory, you can safely remove any access for "others".
As for exim, you should check out its manuals and find whether it's being used by any non-privileged user, say, often there's exim user/group used to run exim daemon. If by logic of exim service operations the config file in question should be readable to exim user, you could think that user exim can be the owner of the config. But in fact, this is a security breach, cause had exim service running under exim user compromised, an attacker can change the config.
I saw /etc/exim.conf is world-readable.  The issue with this is to configure Exim to use an SMTP service like Sendgrid to route all outgoing email, you put your username and password into that file, which would then allow unprivileged users on the server to obtain it.
