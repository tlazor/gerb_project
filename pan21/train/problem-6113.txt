so, for four GB of RAM your swap needs to be at least 4294967296 bytes or 4295 MB to use all the features.
The Ubuntu SwapFaq will probably answer a lot of your questions.  With larger amounts of RAM you may benefit from changing the default "swappiness" as outlined in this article.
first of all, if you want to use hibernation etc, you'll need a swap partition at least the size of your RAM.
From my personal experience with Linux, I came to know that the conventional formula of 2X the size of RAM suits only older systems with 1 GB - 2 GB of RAM.
Although I recommend to use the original amount of RAM if your memory is atleast 4 GB. That should keep the system stable and efficient.
secondly, remember that RAM is sized in multiples of 2 and not multiples of 10, so declaring 1GB of space for 2 sticks 512MiB of RAM (each 536870912 bytes) is not enough, as this is only 1000MB (1000000000 bytes) and not 1024MiB (1073741824 bytes) as required... instead you'll need to take a calculator, and do 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * # of GiB
According to the Ubuntu SwapFAQ here the calculation is 2*MB of RAM. So in this case 8GB. Realistically however you should not need more then 2GB.
