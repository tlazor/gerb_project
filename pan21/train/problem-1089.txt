For local addresses, if you have access/control of the DHCP Server (router, or whatever) then no, you don't. Most have the ability to permanently assign a local address to a particular computer (It does this by checking the MAC address is the same). 
To better help you it would be interesting to know why you want a static IP address. Services like dyndns might be able to help you if you just want to host some kind of service at home.
The address only needs to be static if you are expecting connections that start from outside the concerned machine or network. In things like web browsing the connection is instigated from the machine, and contains the information of where to send the response, this a static address is not required. 
3) Since the point of ip address is to uniquely identify a computer in a network, shouldn't the address be always static? in other words if the address keeps changing then how can it help in uniquely identifying a computer?
My laptop is connected to the internet via a wifi router. In other words my router is connected to the internet. When i check my ip address via a web service i see that the ip address keeps changing. The ip address that my router gets yesterday is different from what i get today.
