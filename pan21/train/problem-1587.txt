Since we keep the host fairly bare and do all work in the virtuals, very few host updates are needed, kernel, X and virtualization code mainly. 
technically yes because the VM saves the files to the host PC so its risky and it depends on the virus 
In response the John T's post about bridging - There is nothing required the host to be addressed. In our setups the host never has an assigned ip and therefore has no network connection. When updates are needed all virtuals are suspended, the host is temporarily assigned an IP, updates are performed, host IP is removed, then virtuals can be resumed.
A little late to the answer party, but affect can have multiple meanings.  The virus can be contained and have no risk of spreading from the VM.  However, it can still consume resources such as CPU, RAM, disk, and the network of the host machine.
The main reason a virus could propagate from VM to host Operating System is via the network. Once you start using bridged networking between the host and guest things get more risky. Your machine and the VM are seen as 2 nodes on the same subnet. A worm which sees these 2 nodes has the possibility of propagation if such a vulnerability is found.
