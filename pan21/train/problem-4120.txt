Note that you may not find a system with only essential packages very useful: it doesn't contain apt to install more packages from the Internet and it doesn't contain a kernel, since not all environments need a kernel.  However, provided you can get software onto the system, you can install additional packages.
How to know - beyond blind trial&errro - what is the maximally possible set of packages to uninstall but still having a minimal working system?
Essential packages may depend on non-essential packages, since a shared library may not be essential.  You'll therefore have to resolve the dependencies yourself, or just be sure you pull them in.
This is easy for Debian and Ubuntu, which have the concept of essential packages.  These are packages without which the system will not function and which are assumed to be on all systems; as such, no dependency on them is required.
Red Hat and CentOS don't document which packages are required outside of a minimal install, so you'll have to just use trial and error there.  You may find that the same set of packages as for Debian (minus Perl) may be a good starting point.  You may also find this CentOS forum thread interesting.
