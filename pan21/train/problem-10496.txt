The default set of indexed folders was based on the defaults from my media PC which had a clean install of Windows 10 (wasn't upgraded from Windows 7 -> Windows 8 -> Windows 8.1 -> Windows 10 like my main machine)
Be aware some test showed me the there seems to be no difference copying files to "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs" OR "C:\Users\John\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs". 
As well i read on some topics that you should NOT exclude the default library folders (e.g. dokuments, pictures etc) from the indexed folders because this will cause massive problems with the search.
After waiting a little while for things to re-index the start menu is returning correct results as quickly as I can type!
I think you're actually indexing too many files and that's stopping the search from returning useful results. Your Indexing Options screen shows around 1.9 million items indexed.
After upgrading to Windows 10, Cortana search was not finding applications for me because the Samsung Magician software I installed for my SSD drive was configured to Maximum Reliability mode, which disabled indexing service/search. In order get Cortana to find applications installed on my machine again, I needed to change to Maximum Reliability mode in the Samsung Magician software. This answer will be helpful for anyone with Samsung SSD and Samsung Magician software.
I fixed this problem by Enabling the Windows Search service in services.msc. Not sure if I disabled it during tweaking by accident or if it came like that after Win 8.1 upgrade. After re-enabling and starting the Windows Search service I could search my apps again.
If you do skip the step 4 windows will create on every restart a new temporary user folder with will be removed with a reboot.
I had about 1.5 million files in my index as well, with all of my development files under my C:\Users\<username>\ directory. My start menu search was really slow and was wasn't returning useful results (wouldn't find built in apps like Internet Explorer or Edge). 
I was able to fix it by resetting my "Indexed Locations" to the Windows defaults (Right-click start button -> Control Panel -> Indexing Options -> Modify).
Finally I triggered a rebuild of the index (Right-click start button -> Control Panel -> Indexing Options -> Advanced -> Rebuild).
