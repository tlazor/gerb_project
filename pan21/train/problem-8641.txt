Combine both to achieve the desired effect. The shadow can be another spherical game object with varying alpha values (transparency).
2. The texture that is being applied to. Make the texture repeat itself on the direction it is going. For example a forward pass will make the texture move forward (repeated tiling) and a swerve will move it on the x and y axis at the same time, making the ball look like it is spinning.
You can make the shadow by simply parenting a Sprite with a black circle and adjusting it to be below the ball so that when ball moves this Sprite moves and it looks like shadow. The 3D effect by changing scale depending on the depth or use triggers to shrink it on entry.
I would just cheat and use the formula for a parabola. The ball sprite can be sized based on the height of the parabola.
The game is either doing some trickery to achieve a 3D like trajectory (sine waves, parabolas, etc) or using actual 3D math. 
Then, they simply take the 3d coordinates, and render the ball larger or smaller depending on the depth. Essentially rasterizing.
Shadows are achieved either again with 3d math by projection or simply faking it again with a simple distance algorithm (shadow position.x = ball position.x - ball.position.z * some scale)
1. The game object's size. Whenever the ball is kicked modify it to match the specific action, like a long lobbed pass will make the ball bigger.
