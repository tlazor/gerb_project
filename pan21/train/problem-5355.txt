I can't find reliable documentation, but it appears since windows 7 they changed localhost resolution to DNS. I'm guessing the DNS client service actually hands back localhost when you do an operation, because your DNS server, where ever it is, probably wont resolve localhost. You can always set the hosts file, and it aught to override what the DNS client gives you. 
Obviously I can uncomment the second line to make localhost work. But why is this necessary if the first line is correct? Did Microsoft write the first line? It looks like they're telling me that localhost will work without being defined.
The comment is talking about the DNS implementation in Windows itself, not the DNS implementation in Chrome.
I'm assuming its the DNS service, because on my Win8 box, those lines are commented, and yet localhost resolves back to ::1 and of course my DNS is not configured for IPv6, and even if it were, it wouldn't resolve localhost.
Yes Microsoft did make that change. Apparently this is because on an IP6 only machine (will be more common in the future) that default entry of resolving localhost to IP4 address will cause it not work. So they moved that logic into the DNS resolver itself where they could be independently disabled.
