Would be the file 12343 for the type teacher (type 2 equals teacher) and it would be for teacher with ID 4323.
I could keep the original table but I would prefer to keep the inserts, updates, etc. to a single database to the document relationship table. That and a few other reasons.
The reason I want to do it this way is because the files are now going to be cross-referenced a lot more and in the majority of cases a specific document will be linked to several different users and user types. 
Where documentID is the link to the document file. The dataType is if the data is a specific type of user, for example a student, teacher, vendor, etc. (as these all have different tables). The dataID is the ID of the user. 
It fails at the FROM portion. Yet everything I've read seems to indicate this should work. In theory I need to run this for all the different data types however I can't even get it to work for the first dataType I want to test...
Anyway is there a way to convert from one table to the other? The only possible solution I came up with is to transfer all the documentID and dataTypes in one step. Then transfer the dataID using a combination of matching document ID with dataType, and running one update per dataType. At least in theory... I haven't yet been able to make that work. Is this the only way and if so any suggestions as to the actual SQL would be appreciated. So far I have:
