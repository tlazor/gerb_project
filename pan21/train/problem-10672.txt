Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol.
Provided that all the Music is on the Server, ThereÂ´s nothing more flexible than slimdevices squeezecenter. Of course Logitech will try to sell you their excellent Squeeze*** Devices but the Software also works without them and you can stream to any MP3-stream capable player.
A lot of the answers provided so far seem to assume that you want a streaming solution where each person in the office can play their own individual playlists privately within the confines of their office/cube/pod/etc.  If that's the case, feel free to ignore this answer.
I've really liked using Subsonic Media Streamer - seems to be the best mix of features and has a good inline player. Jinzora isn't bad either, but is a lot rougher around the edges.
However, it sounds to me like you want what is effectively an office Jukebox  where there's only ever one song playing at a time and everyone in the general area hears the same thing.  For a long time, my office mate and I had a setup for this type of situation using a combination of WinXP, Winamp, and a utility called WWWinamp.  It looks like the WWWinamp project has been taken over and ported to .NET since we were using it.  But basically, it provided a simple web interface to browse, search, and queue up music in Winamp on the "server" (the XP machine).  The server played the music through directly connected speakers that we could both hear.  We eventually added a simple Windows Media stream of the current audio output so that we could listen to "what was playing" remotely as well.
