HDMI cable will be the way to go, that way you'll get the audio through it as well. using a DVI would mean you'd have to get S-Video/VGA converters.
I would just use HDMI.  DVI will require you to buy some converters which you don't want to do.  Also HDMI is easier because it carries sound unlike DVI.
If you're like me and that's too awkward, or you don't have a space screen with those ports, and you have a spare conventional monitor, grab yourself a HMDI to VGA converter. I bought mine for around Â£5, it doesn't work for things like your PS3 or Apple TV, but works fine for the Raspberry Pi.
To answer the second half of your question, which is better, HDMI or DVI, there is really only one difference.  Both use the same video compression, the difference is audio.  DVI only supports video, HDMI also supports HD Audio of various compression schemes.  If you will be using audio from your Pi, use HDMI, otherwise, use whatever cable you can find at the best value, and whatever is more convenient.  I would think that either way you could find a single cable that does not require any adapters.
The best way is by connecting it to a TV with a HMDI port, if that is not available try an older TV (or some current TVs) with the yellow cable.
