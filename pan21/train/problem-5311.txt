Third, if it's not a massive table-formatted selection, try pasting into Wordpad (instead of Notepad), then copy and pasting from Wordpad to Word.  Wordpad can often preserve significant portions of the formatted structure of your paste selection. Notepad will strip out ALL formatting and it may take you much longer to fix your pasted text from Notepad than the original wait pasting directly to Word. 
Second, if you're using a firewall, try denying Word 2007 access to the internet.  There's still some delay, but it's quicker.
First, try to select/copy/paste with a different web browser.  I often find that if I try more than one browser I'll find one that handles the copy and paste of the custom background formatting better.  For example, on some websites IE8 recently began replacing spaces in the filename with with plus symbols when downloading files.  This extremely annoying problem was completely resolved by pasting the URL into Firefox and downloading the file from there.
Its a frustrating mix of no web-page formatting standards, browser/OS ability, and an overly-helpful Office 2007.  Hope one of these suggestions makes things a little easier for you!
