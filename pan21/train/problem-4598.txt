Create another shared network directory that is readonly for everybody else. Let's name the share pdf-ro. In Samba's config file smb.conf set this up like that:    
One workaround we used in my office with shared files like this that needed to be updated regularly (mostly spreadsheets) was a hidden shared folder that only the person that needs to update the file has access to.  This folder has the "master" of the shared copy, and you just copy it out once its edited.  If it's locked it's less of an issue since the update is done.
I'm assuming this is windows.  You can set the permissions where the users can only read the document (read only).  This might prevent the system from placing a lock on the file.  If that doesn't work you can always powercycle the server which is serving the file and all locks will be lost.  (logging out and back in might do it too but I wouldn't be certain).
Be aware that any update to the PDF document by the publisher will not be automatically noticed by the clients. Depending on their PDF viewer software + version, they may still see the old version of the file unless they re-load it.
If slartibartfast's answer isn't feasible for you for some reason (like not wanting to set up your first-ever intranet web server...), consider the following.
If the file server is based on Unix/Linux/MacOSX using Samba: Create a shared network directory that is read/write for the publishing user(s). Let's name the share pdf-rw, and one of the publishing user(s) pdfpublisher. In Samba's config file smb.conf set this up like this:    
If the file server is based on Windows: Pick one of the suggestions made by other users and test if it works for you.
