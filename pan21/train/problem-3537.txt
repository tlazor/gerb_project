First & foremost, that checkbox is not a status indicator! It is essentially a 3-state switch that affects the read-only attribute only on the files within the folder. The 3 states are:
In addition, the read-only attribute on a folder doesn't affect file permissions in any way. It only serves to tell Windonws to process the desktop.ini file found within the folder.
If you want to accurately know whether or not the read-only attribute is set for a folder, add the 'Attributes' column to a Details view in Explorer:
So I have this windows XP box which has a folder. When I look at its properties, it read-only is enabled. When I uncheck this checkbox and saves it, it saves with no messages, but when I open it again it shows the checkbox checked!!
You can safely ignore the read-only attribute, and the associated check box, for folders, the vast majority of the time. The exceptions would be special Windows folders, which you should not be modifying anyway.
You might not have ownership. These two links should help. I had a similar issue with a client and book marked those links. It fixed his issue. Hopefully it fixes yours.
