Here as I understood the mongo instances (A,B,C) means that three mongod. Suppose that among three of node A,B,C they have some different users with different roles . Suppose that when replication has been made with the node A as primary replica set with their admin database & their roles authentication.
As whatever before the replication you have the Users & roles of the the node B,C it will be remain there but after the replication if you shall create new users or roles to members of replica then need to Resync a Member of a Replica Set
As @AdamC has been already stated that here If they are members of the same replica set, then no. The users will be written to the primary and then replicated to the secondaries - remember any secondary can become primary in a normal set, so you would have to have all the data necessary to do that, including users. If the nodes are in the set when they are added, the users will replicate normally. If you add them later, they will replicate the users as part of the initial sync process.
After making the configuration file of A,B,C with thier different path start the mongod server process.
