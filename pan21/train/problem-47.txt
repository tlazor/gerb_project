The higher resolutions look ok, if you can tolerate the interlace, but my primary interest was to have something I could plug multiple pi's into, and getting a huge resolution was not a priority. I had a little trouble getting a sunxi OS to push the native resolution. (Xorg keeps resetting it even if I force it with xrandr or fbset, and Xorg doesn't auto-detect well with the framebuffer mode) As a result, I could only seem to get either the 1920x1280 or 1280x720 modes to work consistently with a sunxi booted system on the HDMI/VGA connectors and could only get NTSC or PAL standard resolutions to work on the A/V. (both of these are fuzzier than forcing the A/V to 800x480)
There are some china-special monitors for sale on places like eBay and amazon in the $55-65 range. I picked one of them up, and they have a HDMI, VGA and A/V input. I've already tested the raspberry pi on all three and was able to get it working at multiple resolutions. The stuff above the native resolution will interlace and becomes hard to read on the small screen, and the native resolution is a weird, 6:9 WVGA standard of 800x480p60, but raspbian supported it just fine through HDMI, through my HDMI->VGA converter and even on the composite video output. It's nice and crisp at that native resolution, and looks reasonably good at anything close to or less than that.
So currently I have one RPi connected to the HDMI, another to the VGA with the adapter, and a BPi connected to the composite. You can switch between the three with the remote. (and I have a iogear multi-link keyboard/touchpad - nice little set-up with my primary pc and laptop on the main monitor HDMI/VGA respective!)
