If you don't want to be scanned, move the SSH port and/or install fail2ban.  If you're really paranoid, you can install a port knocker that "hides" your open port from the casual scanner and/or use iptables to whitelist IP addresses.
There is no such thing as a "DNS" connection. Once the client gets an IP, it can ONLY make a TCP/IP connection. The server only sees IPs, so it has no idea what name the client used to find the server.
The reason we have website Virtual hosts is because the client transmits a header asking for a specific host. In fact, virtual hosts didn't work with SSL until SSL(TLS) was modified to allow "Server Name Indication" during the initial connection.
What you can do is have multiple IP address on the machine. Then each of your A record points to a different IP address which ultimately all go to the same box. Then you'll be able to use ListenAddress to restrict. Not quite sure what you gain from that since ultimately, it's the same machine anyway.
For "virtual hosts" to work with SSH, it would need a way for the client to transmit the hostname upon connection.  But even if SSH supported such a feature, you're adding zero security by requiring a specific hostname.  The reason is that sshd must decrypt the atacker's packet to run the filter. As long as you disable SSH passwords, there's little difference to decrypting the attacker's packet to compare with your SSH key.
