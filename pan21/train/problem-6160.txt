Your IO subsystem (aka disks) are your problem here. Your system is spending a huge amount of time waiting for IO requests to be fulfilled. I tend to start looking at upgrades whenever my systems reach ~5% iowait. Needless to say, you're way beyond that.
It looks to be high disk utilization as iostat is at 100 for the majority of the time with respect to %util (last column):
Currently we have a number of Amazon AWS c3.large setups and I'm trying to figure out the bottle neck. The load is very high on most of them during our peak periods.
You'll need to increase the amount of IOPS that are available to your system. Your first option is migrate to a PIOPS (Provisioned IOPS) EBS volume if you're not already using one. After doing that, then increase the IOPS setting until you get the performance you need.
Although watching the tps (IOPS) seems to average about 70-80. So it seems to be enough. But I do notice some occasional high bursts well above that. I believe that shouldn't be a problem either as the bursts are up to 3000.
The thought might be that the IOPS used with the 64 GB General Purpose SSD might not be enough (192 IOPS).
