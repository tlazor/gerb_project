This is also free for SLES as well. It isn't as featured as Novell's enterprise linux management, but at least it'll get you a local update repo to sync your servers against.
Without preaching too much, if you have a large number of servers, configuration management is a big issue. You might as well bite the bullet now and spend some time looking at automated configuration management tools (puppet, cfengine, bcfg, etc.) that can handle this as well as other tasks. Just my 2 cents.
Other options are (assuming you're using relatively new SuSE) scripting Zypper to do the updates for you, or just scripting the YoU tool if that's possible. Personally, I try to stay away from any of the Yast stuff if at all possible (I'd rather do things with files and tools I can script).
Novell's Subscription Management Tool has a not very well known feature of also being able to replicate openSUSE update archives. All you need is a novell.com login, free and if you have SLES you probably already have one. Look for in the SDK repos for SLES.
I use Puppet for all configuration and package management on servers. Though it's probably not the easiest method for homogenous servers if they weren't all built from a single source.
