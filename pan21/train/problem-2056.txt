3nd. when aligning the framing to your reference planes ensure that you are aligning to a 'reference' (information of preselected object is in the bottom left) not geometry.
2nd. Make sure that the dimensions in the nested family are referencing 'Reference Lines' or 'Reference Planes' to expose them to the host family (references to geometry will not be accessible in the host family).
4 Create a beam system. This allows you to define the perimeter of a set of parallel beams, and control placement, spacing, etc.. If you adjust the perimeter of the system, the beams automatically adjust.
1 Align the end of the beam to your reference plane and lock. Make sure that you are selecting the 'shape handle' when aligning or the relationship will break. The 'Status Bar' bottom right of the UI provides feedback on what you are hovering over when the align tool is active. If you move the reference plane the beam should stretch.
3 Use a Dimension string to adjust the length. Place a dimension string, and make sure you are dimensioning to the 'Shape Handle' of each end. After placing the Dimension you can select the beam, and the dimension value should be blue and you can select and change the value.
2 Make sure you have a structural element at the ends of your beam. A Structural wall (there is a instance parameter named this), a Beam or Column that you Trim to or Drag the end to, should clean up and cut back the Beam. Once this relationship is established the Beam should stretch when you move the the intersection object.
Firstly I recommend updating Revit. The last 2 versions 2016 & 2017 are much faster than previous versions. The Beam template has also been updated and works much better than previous versions.
1st. In most cases you will need to have the length parameter inside the nested (term for family loaded inside family) set as 'instance'.
