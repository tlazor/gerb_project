And then check the size and free space of the ibdata1 files on the data dir of the MySQL server. You may need to increase the available size for the tablespaces, make it autoincremental or use innodb_file_per_table=1.
While the CREATE TABLE is a strange error, and should be investigated further and/or reported to see if the failback operation should be done for Workbench, your real problem is the first one:
I have been trying to add another column to a table in my database using MySQL Workbench. This generates an 'ALTER TABLE' command which then fails as  it fails attempting a 'CREATE TABLE, which it should not be doing as the table already exists!  The output is below:-
Also, depending on the setting of 'tmpdir', it may be running out of room in the temp directory.  (Hence, I argue against carving up disk into filesystems.)
This suggests that the engine cannot alter the table because it has run out of space. This doesn't necessarily mean that the database has run out of disk space, but InnoDB does for that particular table. For example, if you have a fixed size for the main tablespace and not using innodb_file_per_table=1 and using the COPY algorithm for the alter, it will require as much space as the size of the whole table for the operation.
ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMN must copy the table over and rebuild the indexes.  This means that it needs about as much extra space as the table requires.  It may not seem like the disk ever got full, but it may have, then got freed up when the error occurred.
