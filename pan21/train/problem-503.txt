Running Windows 8.0 Pro, chkdsk has a /scan option that Runs a online scan on the volume (sic). What is an online scan?
If you ask it to scan and fix files while the operating system is running it will try with all iof its heart and informative advisory pop up messages to convince you to scan 'n fix the very next time you boot the computer instead of now. That piece of advisiory code probably means business and it wont let you run a big scan or fix even one randomly selected file without command line or other termiinal commands and some identification that proves you are an administrator who outranks that piece of code. That is most likely in your own best interest because there is some risk doing very deep scans for broken and lost files, there is a very big risk of trying to fix broken pieces of an operating system and uits file system while its running. Its the same basic reason that almost noboy who is both sane and competitive plays Jenga while standing on a paint shaker. If the files are bad and you want them returned to a state that can be found read and written then scan and fix offline. Even if they are all fine and plowing through the files with scandisk and chkdsk or any other blunt brutal and automatic fixer, then t will take MUCH less time if the file fixer is running before the OS boots. On a big  hard disk with reasonably sloppy filing and some troubles to fix it could take an hour or two longer with the OS running. By running it means that chkdsk might give you enough resources to play play spider solitaire slow and balking. Or perhaps start a web browser enough to lock the screens and cursors until the scans and fixes are done. It really is better offline.
