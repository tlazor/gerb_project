I working with CAD and Max you can drow in CAD and Modifying in MAX and rendering because MAX is Faster in rendering 
It's been a long time since I've used AutoCAD. However, I believe AutoCAD is designed more towards professional architects that plan on drafting blueprints along with visuals whereas Max is mostly visuals with the ability to get really creative at design time and designed for artists. 
Listen to what anyone says about Autocad, because I don't know it much, I've studied Max and to a lesser degree Maya. So an autocad user might have some things to consider.
The target audience of AutoCAD and it's functionality may have changed since my experience while working as a land surveyor. 
It probably depends on what it's for and what your employee is telling you to do (if you get to that stage). If this is just for yourself, don't bother with Autocad, just use Max, it's so much more fun. Max and Maya are great tools for 3d visualization, I've seen some wicked home interiors made with these packages. You can model everything in Max for visualization, but if you need technical specs then Autocad might be the way to go.
