I'm trying to develop a standard configuration for these devices, and this is causing me major difficulties.
The only thing that appears to work is manually inputting the ip address of the local server. Unfortunately as these devices have the possibility of moving between sites, this is not an answer as I would need to enter over 100 individual IP addresses manually onto every device that we send out in order for them to function at every site, and being that the network settings will not allow me to save when I attempt this, it is not viable anyway.
I have tried putting local, .local, and *.local in the bypass list on the device, and none of them work.
Ideally I want a way to tell the Android device to bypass the proxy for any site that is on the current subnet, IE if it is connected to 10.61.1.0, then it should be able to access the websites on 10.61.1.100, and if it is then moved to 10.61.2.0 it can access 10.61.2.100 without a need to reconfigure.
I am deploying Android 4.4.3 devices to sites, and need a proxy for external internet access as it's a corporate environment. However, each site has a number of web pages hosted locally on the site server, meaning I need to bypass the proxy for the local subnet.
