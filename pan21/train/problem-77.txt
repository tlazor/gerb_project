As you noted, AFP supports server side copies. The latest unreleased version of gvfs contains a number of improvements to gvfsd-afp to make it more reliable and faster. In my tests, it is able to get about 70MB/s for a large transfer on 1GBE and is able to duplicate a directory of 10000 files in 11 seconds which is not too bad. If server side copies are important and you don't want to be logged into a terminal, this is what I'd recommend to use.
We also plan on adding server side copy support for gvfsd-smb soon, but who knows when "soon" may be...
I'm wondering which file transfer protocols available on Linux support server-side copying (and doesn't internally download and reupload files). The simplest use case I have is for copying large files (such as VMs) from one directory to another on the same share.
I know Samba 4.1.0 recently implemented support for FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK in the SMB2 protocol, but as far as I know, no client-side tool/file manager supports this yet (link). I've also looked at AFP, but the only two Linux tools for mounting AFP shares are gvfs-afp and afpfs-ng and neither are too great. afpfs-ng is unmaintained and doesn't cooperate well with netatalk (segfaults), while gvfs-afp has very low throughput compared to afpfs-ng when it works. Update: it looks like the next version of NFS might support this too.
