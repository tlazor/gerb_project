Yes, in a way.  The most important thing is to at least be aware of the methods that hackers use to penetrate systems.  That opens your eyes to a lot of things that you might not have otherwise considered as potential threats.  (Of course, if you're experienced with the hackers' tools and methods, you'll be even better at defense, but that takes a lot of time and isolated resources.)
The trouble with the "Almost" is that it can consume all of your time, and several other professionals, trying to bridge the gap between vulnerabilities your tools know about and what MIGHT be vulnerable in the future.
Instead of spending so much time trying to learn how to attack your own systems, the best approach is to use current best practices - Arrange your network for defense-in-depth, update strong passwords often, set up two factor authentication, use least privileges, shut down unneeded services, and patch often.
Most system probing tools are, essentially, attacks, probing for open ports and known vulnerabilities. So, if you know how to run the tool, and interpret the results, you know just about enough to secure your systems.
