Eclipse by default compiles automatically in the background. You can disable this behavior from the Build menu: make sure Build automatically is disabled.
Personally, I prefer automatic building, but I can understand that on older machines it may make things sluggish. Alternatively, if you have a multi-core processor, you may want to consider giving Eclipse core affinity.
Are there any settings that might could fix this its getting really annoying. it happens almost every time i even click "find" on the find pop-up window and it is not like it is having to search a big file or anything it is only 700 lines, with honestly only about 1/2 that have content on them. Any ideas?
The problem is i like to listen to videos online (mostly or all flash video) while programming and never had any problems until i started using eclipse, now every time i do just about anything other than type, it makes the video skip/freeze really bad and is really annoying. I have never had this happen using visual studio, netbeans, or adobe flash for that matter, unless i was compiling or doing something that hogs the processor.
