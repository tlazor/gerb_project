What application is making the sound? I've never heard Windows make a sound when connecting to WiFi (or any network), so I suspect that some third party software is doing this. If your laptop came with some sort of "wireless manager" app (HP and Lenovo in particular like to do this), check its settings to see if there's any way to disable the sounds. You can probably even get away with just outright removing any "special" software they offer, since you don't really need anything more than the default Windows 7 wireless manager.
These are the Things that I treid, And May work for your situation! ( The last one listed is the one that worked for me! )
In Windows7, the additional volume slider doesn't appear until it's actually making sound. I'd bring up the volume mixer and trigger the connection, at which point you should see its specific slider appear.
