Just few minutes ago, I copied from other server all the /etc/munin directory (with an older version of munin), so I killed all "munin" processes before trying again. After retrying, munin was working without issues. I thought it was something inside the configuration files but even replacing the munin directory with the previous one it worked without problem (after restarting all munin services and removing any munin process) . 
I solved the problem but I'm not 100% sure what was the source of it. I tried many things to bring back the error without success. I suspect there was an -old- munin process hanging there. The server is a production server so I didn't restart it. 
Summary: I probably installed munin too soon, when the server was not properly set up. After munin failed, some process might have been running which prevented munin to work correctly. Killing all "munin" process may have solved the problem.
When I had the problem described above, I restarted munin as usual "/etc/init.d/munin restart" or "service munin restart" and also "munin-node". I even purge and reinstalled munin but the problem persisted.
