It's 2018, with my KDE Fedora 25, kernel 4.13.16-100.fc25.x86_64 and the M560 middle square button works out of the box as a normal middle button (button 2).
I choose the text I need to copy/paste while holding the right button, after choosing where to paste I click button. If need to paste again the same text, since the square button doesn't raise the same events every time, I'll click it quickly twice.
If you select another text the event scattered from the square button is always the one that makes xte to emulate the middle click.
I'm sorry to be That Guy, but please bear with me. I've been using Logitech mice and pointing devices on a number of machines, Windows, Linux and both, without issues. Even the T650 touchpad, which was advertised as being a Windows 8 device, worked properly in Linux with a firmware update. The M560 simply can't be made to work 100% correctly in anything but Windows without some rather excessive hacks. You may be able to swap with someone else for an older/working model, or you might be able to get a refund since it's not at all clear from the packaging that the mouse isn't compatible with anything but Windows, but I really wouldn't recommend spending much time on it.
