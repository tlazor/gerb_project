I know this is an old thread, but the monitor in question displays only 1280x800 and below with any cable other than a dual link dvi-d. An HDMI to DVI-D cable didn't work, nor did DVI-D single link. When the dual link is used, multiple resolutions up to 2560x1600 are available. The monitor auto switches to lower resolutions for games (1920x1080). I'm using an NVIDIA GTX 1060 for graphics. Great monitor.
I have a dell monitor 3007wfp-hc with dual link  dvi 25 pin cable connection. We just bought a dell desktop I660s which has a hdmi cable connection what can I do to get 2560  1600 resolution.Can I upgrade my video output? I have a integrated video card Intel HD graphics (dell)
To get 2560x1600 resolution from that HDMI port it would require HDMI spec 1.3.  I'm not sure but I find it unlikely your Integrated Graphics would support that.
The best solution is to put a Low profile PCI express video card in the expansion slot.  If you got a graphics card with a Dual Link DVI or equivalent port it would definately support that high resolution.
