Is there some strategy or pattern to handling this? I thought about implementing a method on the client side that basically says, give me start position and end position and I'll transition the triangle between the two points smoothly. But this may not be the right answer.
Is the right strategy simply to let the Service always tell me where the other clients are and the client simply draws them there? 
What I am seeing is my client updates very smooth (because I update my own position locally before sending it off to the web service), however, other triangles come in and appear choppy.
I use a web service that is called approximately every 20ms (and responds pretty quickly might I add). However, I know that XNA framework calls its update/draw methods approximately 60 times per second correct? Given this, there is ALWAYS going to be the appearance of choppiness.
I am currently using C# XNA Framework to simply connect some development concepts that I've learned/used over the past few months. Right now I have a Web Service that keeps track of connected clients and their 2D positions. I have a very small map that uses triangles to represent clients and their positions.
