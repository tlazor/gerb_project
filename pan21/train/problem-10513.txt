(Make sure to use version 12 on Windows 10, as the previous version has some trivial issue due to a storage related change that was made to Windows 10 which broke the compatibility. It causes the program to fail on detecting and displaying a list of drives, which makes it useless. So basically, use version 11 on anything from Win XP to Win 8.1, but for Win 10 and up, only use version 12 or higher.)
Partitions must be contiguous. As you have another partition in between, you cannot extend C: to that free space.
Also, do not forget to check out Gparted. Aside from being full featured, free as in "freedom of speech", it also supports all common partitioning schemes, and plenty of file systems, including the latest NTFS. If you know how to create a bootable DVD or UFD, then you should know how to make Gparted operational on your PC.
I am personally a long time Acronis DD user and I can assure you that it's one of the best, if not the best partitioning tool available for Windows. It's so good that I have it installed on every one of my Windows PCs.
Note! In order to complete step 3 you will have to use another tool, because Disk Manager in Windows doesn't understand what it means to move a disk partition/volume. I don't think Microsoft has made any improvements to the Disk Management tool since they acquired the technology some 20 years ago from Veritas Software. Ability to move partitions has been on the wish list of Windows users ever since.
The AOMEI partitioner has the benefit of having a light, freeware version. The Acronis partitioner does not.
