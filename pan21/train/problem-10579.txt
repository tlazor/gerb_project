IMPORTANT: Properly speaking, you should do step 4 for every increment of mirror_metadata. Rdiff-backup prior to 1.1.1 does not mind having extra mirror_metadata entries for files that are removed from the backup set this way, except in the most recent version of mirror_metadata. However, at 1.1.1 the mirror_metadata handling changed -- rdiff-backup now diffs the metadata files -- and it's unknown whether having extra entries in these diff'd files will affect restore operations. (Technical note: the mirror_metadata diffs are NOT using the same method as file diffs. They are not rdiff delta files, but plain text files (and no, they are not ordinary text diffs either). Because of this, it is safe to hand-edit them, so if you need to you can do step 4 on these diffs.)
I didn't test it, but choose a 'saver' way by deleting all files which are already gone voor 2 weeks, by running  
This method is very dangerous and shouldn't be used, unless the files that you want to remove are causing your backup drive to run out of space and your only alternative to removing those files is removing entire increments.
The process for dealing with deletions when you've run out of space is described in the unofficial FAQ under How do I remove files from the backup set. Repeating here just for completeness.
it appears somebody made a script doing the above steps https://www.eugenemakerspace.com/wiki/Sites/Rdiff-backup-delete
