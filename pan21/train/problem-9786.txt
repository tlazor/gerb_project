Our monitoring solution is Zabbix, and the reason these services are picked up is because Zabbix scans for all services running on the host machine. I am not aware of any way to make the discovery rules filter out services that start with CDP_ or Service_ in our version of zabbix so i'm just trying to find a good workaround. We are running version 2 of zabbix
We are are running a couple of Windows Server 2016 boxes for some of our environments to start testing things out but we have been getting constant errors from the two above services not running. Essentially, the above services create themselves as users log in, so when the user logs out the service is left in a stopped state and we can't start it or alert it so our monitoring system continues to alert us about useless errors. All the services do is sync maps, contacts, and e-mail so i'm not sure why they are even included in the Windows Service 2016 image.
I'm curious to see if anyone else has ran into this issue and has possibly found a solution or does everyone just ignore them?
