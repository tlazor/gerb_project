Well ASC/ASCQ 0x20/0x0 translates to INVALID COMMAND OPERATION CODE which might as well have been "INVALID FIELD IN CDB" e.g. this cmd is not supported at this target. What we don't know is what the command actually is that caused this fallout. Turning on verbose debug for this proprietary MP driver might help.
Seeing that this is SAN wide, and assuming you're running the same LSI RDAC MP tool on all of them, I would concentrate my efforts on an LSI MP bug or a SAN configuration problem. I would also look into any clustering configurations and make sure they haven't been switched on by accident.
Since you're using the LSI mpath driver, you should really start with their support and take it from there. It's important to keep perspective here, as in so far this message hasn't resulted in any fatal or detrimental behavior, that you've measured so far. Keep that in mind if/when support asks you to reassemble your SAN ;).
The 0x02 is the status byte set to CHECK CONDITION, which means we have a problem, the driver byte is 0x08 which can be anything the vendor wants iirc. I don't know what 0x05/0x94/0x01 stands for, ask support.
