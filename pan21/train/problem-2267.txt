I normally don't support using 3rd party software, but sometimes you have no choice. In my cases it worked like a charm :)
I have been struggling with this for a while.  You can delete everything else on a slide and save your background as a picture file and when you Format Background, import that File.  Now the background will show up in the .pdf file.
Try printing to a PDFCreator "Printer", then it will output from the RAW .prn file a PDF, which should containt your Resolution settings.
If you're using Powerpoint 2007 or 2010 then the max DPI it will save a PDF at is 220, even if image compression is turned off.
It seems Powerpoint is compressing the images in my slides (each slide in my powerpoint is 1 large image). I have turned off image compression in the advanced settings.
You could install PDF printer software like PDFCreator then "print" your presentation, make sure to check the High Quality checkbox. In PDFCreator click Options then Formats -> Compression and change the compression from Automatic to the level of compression you want e.g. JPEG-Minimum. I wouldn't recommend completely turning off compression as this will create a huge PDF document.
