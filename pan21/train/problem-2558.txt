Network issues as you describe were very rare in my experience, and were usually down to hardware faults rather than software faults, again, no admin rights needed.
enable cached credentials in the domain, and create a password reset disk for the local account.  I think however you'll be far too busy with other problems should your entire domain dissapear, what work are users accomplishing without network conectivity?  Presuming that their credentials are not cached are you going to let them all log in as admins?
I've worked in this environment in the past where the machines had up to 20,000 student users, and we never even gave admin rights to our full time employed technicians that installed the systems, and we would never had dreamed of giving students admin rights because of the risk of finding Doom/Quake/Minecraft LAN parties in the labs outside of working hours.
If it is a hardware problem, this will show up within minutes if you are using a network based deployment method, at which point the technician/student simply swaps the PC out with a spare, and diagnoses & fixes the hardware issue before making this machine the new spare.
Once Active Directory is in place, it would be used for more than just local admin access, so it would be more fruitful to have higher availability of AD services by having multiple Domain Controllers in the environment. To save resources you can keep one DC as physical and others on virtual environment.
If you are using some deployment technology to reinstall the systems, it only takes a few minutes of technician time to reinstall the PC. It's much more efficient to have someone re-image the system than have somebody logon to diagnose/correct the issue. No admin rights required, as the deployment can handle every part of the deployment processes.
