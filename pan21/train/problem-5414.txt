You can absolutely launch an EC2 instance without an ELB in front of it, but I would also do the following:
If you cannot go with the ELB, it is also worth using Route 53 for DNS.  You get some benefits there, even if you are only using it to resolve this particular webserver.  If you added a second web server in the future, you can do DNS with health checks, and still have some rudimentary load balancing and/or failover.
I have to ask, though, how cost-averse your customer really is.  If you are launching an RDS instance and an EC2 instance with 8Gb memory, you are already spending in the low triple digits per month for this setup (assuming no reservations).  The cost of an ELB is $0.025 per hour, or about $18 per month.  The ELB provides a ton of flexibility, and because it acts as a proxy, you no longer have direct connections to your webserver from the internet.
I think you should at least present the architecture with the ELB included, and see if they flinch at the cost, and if not, go ahead and implement it.
That said, if your client is cost-averse, AWS is not the solution you should be using. Instead, consider using VPSes from Linode, DigitalOcean, etc. For the price, their servers will out-perform EC2 instances by a wide margin. 
ELB is a load balancer. It's only worth using if you have multiple back ends, or if your back ends are in an ASG. Neither of which apply to your situation.  Your backend server is perfectly capable of terminating connections directly.
