Tapes not in use or that are obsoleted are stored here in a concrete lined fireproof cabinet that can lock.
I've also been thinking about physical security lately. If somebody wanted to get access to our company data, the weakest link would be me carrying tapes to and from my car. Is this a concern that anybody else shares, and what have you done to alleviate it?
One set of tapes a month however go to a safety deposit box at wells Fargo.  Always two of us go, sometimes three (its right near where we sometimes go for lunch so convenient).  This is only a few blocks away and we have a spare Iron Mountain case that we use for this transportation.
I currently back up to LTO-3 tapes, and I'm about to cross the threshold where a full backup will not fit on a single tape any more; the weekly and monthly backups will span two tapes. Well, I realized today that I'm going to need a bigger bag, so my question is this:
A nice feature of the Pelican cases is that they come with "pick and pluck" foam so you can have custom shaped padding inside for whatever it is you're carrying. 
I highly recommend Pelican cases. They're virtually indestructible, and waterproof, they even float if dropped in the water. I don't currently use them for tapes but have done so in the past. I've also used them for photography equipment. You can even drive a truck over it.
We use a two part approach, our regular backups go offsite to Iron mountain just like GregD uses once per week.  We normally keep our daily incremental and a full backup on site in our tape library.  
I only have to transport one tape each day, so it goes into one of the compartments of my laptop bag. The bag is big enough that I could carry the five tapes I needed to take with me each day in my previous role. As my beloved laptop is in there as well you can be sure I'm careful about what happens to it and the bag is rain proof as well, as long as it's properly closed.
