Be aware though that if the type of database can only be backed up using a file-based backup, there is no value in incrementals (or differentials, which would be preferred, as you only need the last full and the last diff to restore), as the entire file will be backed up every time.
People from a Linux/Unix background frequently make the mistake of trying to do things on Windows in the Linux/Unix way, and the end result is invariably horrifying (the opposite is also true, of course).
It is absolutely possible to write a batch script that copies files and keeps version of specific ages.  I would probably keep my weekly copies in a folder different from the nightly ones.  Copy the oldest nightly into the weekly folder on whatever day of the week... then delete the oldest weekly.  Robocopy is capable of determining file age and acting on files based on that age. 
Use NTBackup to set up the jobs you want, it will handle them properly and will create scheduled tasks for you.  It does accept command-line params, but you are better off using the GUI, in particular as this is an unfamiliar environment for you.  Ask yourself - is your data worth so little to you that you would run the risk of scripting something in an unfamiliar environment?
Then schedule your weekly full task to run weekly and grab the oldest/newest/wednesday whatever day you like and copy it to the full folder.   Schedule your other script to run daily.
A really fast scan of the pgdump docs leads me to suspect that every time you back that database up it is a full of the database.  I'm not seeing an option for an incremental.  I haven't used it though and like I said it was just a quick skim over the docs.
