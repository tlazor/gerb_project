I'm dealing with some data that's governed by specific regulations and that must be handled in a specific manner.
My thought is that there should be a filesystem (written as a FUSE system or something - I'm using Linux) that exposes the directory structure as clear text, but writes the contents of the files according to one half of an asymmetric key set.  This would permit me to log the messages and queue them to be sent off to a log server where the decryption key resides.
The inefficient (CPU-wise) nature of asymmetric encryption may make this infeasible, but I suspect that there may be a solution out there.  I haven't found anything in my searching yet; is there a solution out there that can operate in the described fashion?  Thanks for any tips!
I'm finding that this data ends up in some of my log files as a result of the system operating as intended.  I'd like to find a way to log messages on the server that receives that data, but to do so in such a way that the data is encrypted as it's written to disk and may not be decrypted by that same server.
