Seems to me that this is easily met through SNMP traps. Set up your monitoring system (with 1,000 servers you MUST have a monitoring system) to log reboots (or better yet, all traps) into a database, from which you can extract and manipulate the data in any way you see fit. The beauty of storing the traps in a database is that you can run all kinds of queries against it and generate any reports you want.
However, a single-use approach would be to run nmap -O against all servers to use TCP's timestamp fingerprinting feature: http://nmap.org/book/osdetect-methods.html#osdetect-ts. Run hourly and you probably won't miss too many reboots.
If you are using monitoring software and then there are probably ways to get those reports (at least if it something open and not 100% GUI (Unless the GUI Provides the functionality)).  Do you use something like that?
Heck, if you get email alerts, you could just make an outlook filter (If an unreachable alert is close enough to a reboot for you). :-P
What centralised management tools do you already have? SCOM will tell you for Windows and a syslog server will tell you for Linux but most centralised management tools will allow for you to script a report such as this.
Probably the best answer is to use the tool you are already using to monitor your servers. If you don't yet have one, do that first, then ask yourself the same question.
