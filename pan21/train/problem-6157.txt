If you can't do that, you should think about terminating the SSH connections on a dedicated monitoring VM, and using a less security-oriented protocol for the communication between that monitoring VM and the VM where you want logging to occur. (Obviously, you're creating a potential security concern by doing this, so you'd want to proceed with all due caution.)
It sounds like you're using a *nix-based OS, which makes me think you'd get a lot of mileage out of OS-integrated monitoring and auditing tools (which have a long and rich heritage) as opposed to trying to roll something one-off yourself. What's your aversion to using monitoring tools within the VM?
I'm not aware of any hypervisor that has functionality like this, and even if they did, you're talking about trying to capture the interactions of a protocol that's designed with security in mind.
I have a virtual machine running (currently using virtualbox, but this is flexible), which users ssh into. I would like to log the actions the users take in the terminal, but do it from outside the VM. Is this feasible? Do I need to use a different hypervisor?
