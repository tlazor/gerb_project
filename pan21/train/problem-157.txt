I know this may sound like a more hacked up solution, but could you not just add a bit of code to twitch your mouse every couple of minutes?  Nothing major, just add 1, subtract 1 to the current mouse position on either axis.
Final solution I had to adopt was to do the processing in the FormActivate handler.  I then had to close the form by posting a message as the Close method doesn't work until after the OnPaint handler has been called.  Unlike the OnPaint event, the OnActivate event is called when the PC is in screensaver.
So, if this is your case, the application is unable to complete its activity due to revoked access (as your session ends) and when you login again to 'unlock' the system, the session is restarted and you can restart the application too (which might have timed out and stopped without reaching results). However, it starts normally again as you have a new session running now (but, would result in the same problem as you leave it running -- eventually causing a session termination and a screen lock).
