I followed the instructions from Oliver Salzburg because my computer my computer fall asleep. In the Log it said: Sleep Reason: lid close... wich was not the reason because it happend while I was working on the laptop.
Be sure you aren't wearing a magnetic bracelet or watchband of any kind while typing. If the magnet hits the corner of your computer while typing, it will put your computer to sleep.  I have a blaze watchband that has a magnet, and it was putting my computer to sleep randomly. I thought my computer was having hardware issues.  I was the one having hardware issues.  Just FYI.
Oftentimes the cause of this sort of random hibernation/shutdown is overheating. Most computers are set to hibernate if the internal temperature reaches a certain level. A friend of mine has an Asus laptop, and it tends to run hot. Speedfan is a very popular piece of software which can be used to check the temperature being reported by your computer's internal sensors. You should be able to find a datasheet for your CPU, which will tell you the heat tolerances, and whether it is in fact the heat that is causing it to hibernate.
You say power settings were checked. Did you check settings under Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\Edit Plan Settings and then go to Advanced settings and go through and expand every + section? Sometimes there's some missed there. Also check Hibernation if you haven't thought of it already.
Then I realized the reason: I'm wearing a bracelet with a magnetic clasp... Lid close is registered via a magnet in the lid ;-)
