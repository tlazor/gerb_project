To eliminate any chance of faulty queries, could you try dig +trace example.com? It will follow the chain for you. If that succeeds, (it will only try one of the authorities at each level), you have at least one working trail.
Just like to point out one additional possibility, since I just ran into this: someone set the TTL of the DNS record to zero. This actually resolved fine when querying the name server directly, but gave a SERVFAIL when asked trough the local (ubuntu) resolver.
If you saw 5 before and now you see 2, I'd have to guess you made a change to your authorized name server entries ?
There are a couple of minor and fairly unlikely possibilities as well, including daft firewalls at your site rewriting DNS traffic on the fly as it passes through them.  But since you've not provided proper data, there's little more to narrow down and rule-out the possibilities that you can obtain from random passers-by out on Internet.
Don't obscure your DNS data when asking for help with DNS problems.  It's pointless and silly, and this is a classic example of how it has served to obscure the actual problem that you have.
If multiple tries all fail, there is something broken. Chances are you're seeing cached answers with the "normal" request; expect the breakage to surface as soon as the TTL expires.
Note that the only caching that occurrs here is local, on your resolving proxy DNS server.  The content DNS servers that you are querying don't cache.  (Or, more strictly speaking, if they do cache they cache the back-end databases that they are working from, in ways that have little to nothing to do with resource record TTLs, and that aren't publicly visible through the DNS protocol.)
