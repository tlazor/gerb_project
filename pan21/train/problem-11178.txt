Rather than set up a VPS or EC2 server and configuring it with various tools, it seems like this could just be contracted out to a port and vulnerability scanning service. If they do it professionally they may be more up to date than something I set up and let run for a year...
i can offer Snort, considered to be a lightweight IDS. By this, it simply represents itself as a small-footprint, flexible IDS that is intended to be deployed within small to median-sized enterprises. Besides being very simple to set up and maintain, one of Snortâ€™s main advantage is that it can be run in one of three modes: 
I've used tools like Nmap and OpenVAS, but our firewall rules have special cases for connections originating from our own facilities and servers, so really the scan should be done from the outside.
I'm setting up a periodic port scan and vulnerability scan for a medium-sized network implementing a customer-facing web application. The hosts run CentOS 5.4.
We use McAfee Secure for our web scans, they provide in depth scans including PCI compliance. If you are looking for a well known brand with industry approval I would think they are not a bad place to start depending on exactly what you want the scan to do. We have them checking PCI compliance on any of our sites that accept credit card info and scanning all of our IP for open ports, servers for vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting issues, etc.
