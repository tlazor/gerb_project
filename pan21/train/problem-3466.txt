Not the same as yours, but I've managed a SQL server where I imported data from a remote Postgres server two firewalls away. The networking guys had to set something up to route the traffic there.
We have a partner with a SQL server on their network and we need to build reports (Both Excel and Power BI) that are on our network. We are building a IPSec tunnel to their server for connectivity but we can't open their network up to 1000 different connections besides the IPSec tunnel would be a monster and change constantly since excel is on the local PC. 
This leads us to a bit of an awkward arrangement. I need to have reports point to a single server on our network and that server will forward the requests to the remote SQL server and pull the data back into the report WITHOUT actually storing the data. I have set up an alias and linked server but am having issues with the forward without storing data locally.  
I have looked at many of the post for this but don't find something quite like what I need. This may sound like a weird request but:
For legal reason we can't simply replicate the data into a SQL server on our network (We don't own the data -and while we can see it it is not legally the same as being stored on our network - Already checked with the legal department.)
