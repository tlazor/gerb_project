I can say that I have a i7 6700k with 3 out of 4 cores working. If I have all 4 cores active, it will just blue screen when I start my computer. However, when I go into BIOS and change to only 3 active cores, it will perform normally. I have no idea how the core was damaged as I bought this computer broken for a cheap price and fixed it.
A CPU core cannot be compared to a car engine. Depending on the system BIOS, it may or may not detect a core failure. Most probably it will still route operations to the core and fail. The BIOS may allow for discrete core disabling (trial and error on each core), in which case you will be able to operate normally. At the end of the day, time to replace the CPU 
If any core failure is detected at testing and packaging stage, it can be disabled like those AMD 3-core processors.
Say for example, one of the cores in a quad core computer overheated and died, would the system compensate by routing all operations to the remaining 3 cores, or would the computer be inoperable? If the system compensates, could it compensate for 3 of 4 cores failing?
