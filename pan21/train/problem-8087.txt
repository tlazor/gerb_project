The URL at the beginning of the run method is not helpful. There is no context explaining why it is relevant to this piece of code. The post asks about something that this code is not doing. The general consensus of the post is "there is no reason to do that and I have never seen that done."
Why are the variable names changing when they are all the same thing? Variable shadowing is not a valid excuse as you can use this. or prefix your member variables with an underscore.
By writing your class this way, it is always forced to read a file from disk. What happens if you want to stream the song over a socket? Passing the input stream in to the constructor (or even the Player instance) would make your class more flexible and easier to test.
There is no reason Mp3PlayerThread to be a subclass of Thread. Making it a simple class that implements Runnable would allow you to use it in more contexts and not incur the heavy costs of creating a thread every time an instance is instantiated. An example of the expanded context would be to create a thread pool of size one. Then you can schedule multiple songs to be played just by adding an instance to the execution pool for each new song.
