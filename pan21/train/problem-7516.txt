It would be nice if you could elaborate on what you mean by software for "managing" these things. Do you just want to be able to keep track of them as records, or do you want to actively be able to configure all of those services from one interface? Recordkeeping might be easiest to do with your own homebrewed database and accompanying interface, but for other stuff, you'll need something more complex.
We use KeePass at my company to track those things.  All of the IT staff have the master password (we're not big enough to have sub-groups of accounts each person needs to see), and it works ok.  Backups are taken care of outside the app by the same backup software that keeps track of everything else.
It may be overkill or more complicated than what you're looking for, but CPanel is frequently used by webhosting companies as a central tool for managing users, ftp accounts, ssh, databases, etc. It's highly configurable, but also takes effort to set up.
