I'd say that kept in the right conditions (as you said, away from light and humidity, and excessive heat), they should last 7-10 years. I really don't think that plastic sleeves are bad - there's not that much difference between that and anything else - it's still touching something.
If you burned the discs yourself - then make sure you don't use RW formats.  If you did, then you should reburn onto a write once format for longer term storage.  RW dye 'fades' over time - and in my opinion should never be used.
Another thing to consider is the quality of the media you are using.  I have seen some of my hand burned DVD's corrode in a matter of months when they were the ultra-cheap bulk quality discs.  
Commercially pressed dvd's are much less fragile - scratches can be buffed out, as the data is pressed into the media in a totally different way than recordable media.  Expect them to be readable long after any self burned media has become unusable.
I have seen dvd players that cause lots of scratching - so if you are finding scratched discs you might want to take a look at your players - they are usually cheap to replace.
We store in binders with plastic sleeves - we find these simple to store large volumes, and are easy to keep organized. Typical office climate is absolutely fine.
Here's a nice article. Although getting a bit outdated in reference of the hardware mentioned, the general idea is still the same.
