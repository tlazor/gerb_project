This code should work (it's definitely not the prettiest and may be pretty clunky depending on the size of your datasets) but hopefully someone may provide you with something a bit smoother in the future.
This code sets a column (in this case column C) to be the @ symbol if it detects a match between your Query tab and your Formonth tab. It then deletes rows based on the column that has the symbol.
Hopefully the way this is written should allow you to copy and paste. The only thing you need to change is the column that it places the @ symbol because it places the symbol as an offset to column B. These are the following lines (switch out EnterTheNumberYouWantHere and EnterColumnLetterHere)
I have two different sheets, query and formonth, in same workbook.  Columns b on both sheets have the data i want to compare.  If column b on formonth matches any cell in column b on query sheet, i want to delete the entire row on the query sheet.  I have tried so many different ideas with no success.
