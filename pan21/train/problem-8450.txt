They have a pretty good web interface but also have a decent CLI.  You can also export and import the configuration from the box as an ascii file.  And if you start to get more units they also offer some other offerings that make managing a bunch of units centrally.
We've had good luck and support with our Fortigate Units.  The Fortigate 60B should be a good fit for 20 people and has all the features you require and is about $1000.  The support/maintenance with overnight replacement is about $600 a year after the first year.  So your budget should cover the unit and 2 years of support.
You might try SmoothWall - (bias disclosure: I work for SmoothWall). You will certainly find the web filtering worth having, and whilst it won't talk to smartfilter necessarily, I am sure you will be able to negotiate a competitive upgrade.
I wholeheartedly recommend Astaro.  The Astaro Security Gateway is very reasonably priced and has the features you need plus several other worthwhile ones.  It is easy to use and configure, and doesn't require much care and feeding.
You could take a look at an ASA5505 w/ an IPS card. I have no idea how SmartFilter works so i can't say for sure if it work with it, but You can make those little babies do just about anything although sometimes it takes a little convincing.
