What’s happening when you delete the snapshots is it’s merging years of writes from 17 snapshot volumes into the single main virtual disk. 
New-VM -Name $CloneName -VM $SourceVM -Location $CloneFolder -Datastore $Datastore -ResourcePool $ResourcePool -VMHost $VMHost -LinkedClone -ReferenceSnapshot $Snapshot
You can think of snapshots as actually creating a new virtual disk that new writes are committed to. And then when a new read or write happens, data from all inline snapshots are used. This isn’t exactly what happens, but it’s close enough to illustrate the point. 
Ideally you'd shut down the VM in question, then take the snapshot so that it's in a nice clean state, but that might not be possible for you.
In any event, once you have this most recent snapshot, you can actually create a new VM based on it, using PowerCLI.
Normally the only way to get rid of snapshots is to delete them, but given your situation, I think the better approach, oddly enough, is to take another snapshot right now.
Once the clone is done, you power off the heavily snapshotted VM, and power on the new VM, and voila, a you're back in business without having to delete all the snapshots.
