To use Word as the editor select Tools -> Options -> Mail Format and then click "Use Microsoft Office Word 2003 to edit e-mail messages".  Now, open a new message, click into the body of the message, and click Insert -> Picture -> From file.
Here's a simple test of emails sent through the outlook client. Blurry is okay (since I've zoomed in a lot), but artifacting is not:
I never had a problem with screenshot quality in Outlook 2003. I often send emails with inline screenshots and they always looked exactly as the source PNG. Maybe the problem is the source program. I use Irfan View and copy the images from there and paste them into Outlook. At home I use XnView Don't know if that helps but could be worth a try.
The issue is not with the exchange server itself, it's with the outlook text editor.  Anytime an image is modified using the outlook editor, it will get automatically converted into a JPEG once sent.  But unaltered pngs that are pasted inline will be preserved, both in sending and receiving emails from outlook.  
In my experience this will preserve the image as a PNG file in the outgoing message.  Note that I have only tried this using Rich Text messages and haven't experimented to see what will happen with HTML messages.
Do you have the full Microsoft Office 2003 suite installed?  If so, you can use Word 2003 as your editor and use it to inline the PNG image.
