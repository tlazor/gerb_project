I have had 2 laptops stolen and it really pisses me off. I work too hard for my money for some thieving A-hole to enjoy the spoils off it while depriving me of what I rightfully owned. So, I am trying to find a way to protect my Windows laptop from being reused or sold by some immoral prick. It is my understanding that Bitlocker can at least protect my data and keep my laptop from being wiped via USB and reused/resold which is really cool. However, can't they just take out the encrypted drive and replace it with a new one? If so, then for me, Bitlocker will not serve much of a purpose in regards to foiling the attempt of thief to profit from my hard work.  
While physical security is the only option to prevent laptop theft, there are products that can help you recover stolen laptops.  LoJack for Laptops enabled devices can be traced when connected to the internet.
Bitlocker can only prevent the data on your hard drive from being read.  A drive that has been encrypted with Bitlocker can still be reformatted and reused by anyone.
