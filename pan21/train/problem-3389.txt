One important point about a lot of systems management is to immediately take the attitude that it does not matter how many "X" you have to support.  i.e., if this solution works ok for 2, it should work ok for 40, otherwise you're just really setting yourself up for trouble.  So do it right, don't do it dumb.
As in most things, define your threat.  If, for example, you know that for whatever reason you have poor manageabilty of the Windows servers, it may make more sense you just leave them all open and just have 1 central point to manage (the firewall).  Security is always a tradeoff, and as we all know, the only way to be 100% secure is to unplug the computer.  So, you're accepting some level of risk.  If you have to go around to 30 machines to open port 5555 for some application, you've wasted some time that you could have spent in other areas.  Of course, if you have very good group polcies, then this is less of an issue.
If their complaint is that it increases troubleshooting, focus on that complaint.  Maybe this involves centralized management via windows policies of the firewalls on the desktops.  If doing that will cause you to spend 100 hours on a tool, weigh that against how much time is wasted troubleshooting problems caused by the firewall.
