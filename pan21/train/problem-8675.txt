You could also try a different type of VPN connection. PPTP uses GRE, but L2TP/IPSec and SSTP don't. However, the VPN server will need to support them, and it will need a digital certificate; you will also need a certificate on your computer for L2TP/IPSec. It looks as if "BestUKVPN" only support PPTP, so you'll need to decide whether it's more work to change your router or your server.
GRE is a protocol, not a port. (A lot of people say "My router isn't blocking any ports" but that's irrelevant.) Your router needs to understand how that protocol works. In particular, assuming that you're using NAT (Network Address Translation), the router will need to replace your private IP address with its public IP address in the outbound packets, then do the reverse on the inbound packets. If your router doesn't understand GRE then you either need to upgrade the firmware or replace the hardware - you'll need to check the manufacturer's documentation.
