There are many guides to help with securing your network. I would google "Securely run a server from home" to get some ideas.
It is possible that an attacker can use this open port to gain access to your single computer. (Various ways all depending on the attack method). If they gain access to the single computer they then can attack the rest of the network with a broader attack. This is because the information between devices behind the firewall are usually not checked by consumer routers. This is why it is very important to have firewall and antivirus on ALL devices within the network.
I am learning to run a server at home and have only 3 ports forwarded. While this has been only up for a short time, my bandwidth is impacted because I have logs full of different IPs trying to gain access.
To help mitigate this risk you can edit the rules of the port forward to only accept the connections from the IP of the people connectiong to you. Theoretically you should not need to create port forward rulles if you are connecting out, only if you have people connecting to a service you are hosting. Consumer routers generally don't block outgoing connections.
