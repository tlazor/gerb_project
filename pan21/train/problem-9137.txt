Looking at your responses to the two answer here so far, I don't think you're going to find a solution that works the way you want it to without it being some level of hacky because you're not using objects. The actual picture tiles do not have any properties support in Tiled. The only thing that has support for properties are the layers and objects.
I honestly wouldn't suggest this though as its VERY hacky. I think honestly using layers or objects is going to be a much better solution for you in the longer run and will allow you a lot more flexibility down the road, even if it doesn't seem as "nice to write in code" right now. That's what helper functions are for. :)
Define a ladder/stairs tile with a property (in the tileset tile property) to indicate the player can move up or down one layer. 
The only solution I can think of that might work is to keep track of specific tile IDs (the picture tiles, not their location) and use that to help you determine things. For example, if your player steps on the "right-cliff edge tile", they can not move right anymore. If the player steps on to a "ladder tile", then they are allowed to move onto a cliff-edge tile.
