I'm trying to figure out whether a 2012 server can publish transactional replication to a 2005 subscriber. If, in the above context, versions are named versions, the answer appears to be no, for 2005 is three versions behind 2012; if they are numbered versions, the answer appears to be yes, for 2005 (9.x) is only two version behind 2012 (11.x).
Based on the example in the documentation, it appears the answer is numerical versions; however, I don't have a system of my own with instances of both versions to test this on and I'd like to be sure I have this down correctly before I advise someone else about it.
According to Microsoft SQL Server documentation, a "Subscriber to a transactional publication can be any version within two versions of the Publisher version." In this context, are versions named versions (e.g. 2005, 2008 and 2008 R2) or numerical versions (like 9.x, 10.x, 12.x)? 
So, apparently you need to look at numerical versions in this case – meaning that for a SQL Server 2012 publisher the subscriber version should be 11.* ± 2.
