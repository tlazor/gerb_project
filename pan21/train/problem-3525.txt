I use different language versions of Microsoft Office on different computers (English, French and Spanish), so the differences in keyboard shortcuts and the inability to customize them in PowerPoint and Excel is very frustrating. The Alt shortcut system described in another answer might work in some cases, but in my case, it is less than satisfactory. For example, something as simple as "Select All" in Spanish requires Alt,o,รณ,e. But because my keyboard does not have the accented รณ, I can only do "Select All" with Alt,o,Alt+162,e! 
If you're interested in that possibility, here's my PowerPoint shortcut script in AutoHotkey to give you a template for customization (note: my purpose is to use English shortcuts on Spanish Microsoft PowerPoint):
(Note that Alt,o means "press and release the Alt key, and then press and release the o key"; whereas Alt+162 means "press and hold the Alt key while typing 162, and then release the Alt key".)
So, my workaround is to use AutoHotkey to create custom scripts. AutoHotkey lets you create almost any keyboard shortcut for almost anything. They have a tutorial to give you a good idea of what it can do.
