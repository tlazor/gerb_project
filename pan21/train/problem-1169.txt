Name resolution for the name dns.msftncsi.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.  
Try setting the DNS on your router to Google's Public DNS: https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/
The website dns.msftncsi.com isn't a constant, it's been a few random sites (i'm guessing whatever site i'm on at the time of disconnect.)
I have a really small network in my house, with only three computers.  Recently I've experienced my computer disconnecting from the internet for 3-5 seconds, and it only happens two or three times a day.  I get this Warning message in the event logs:
I've been troubleshooting this for a while, and really am out of ideas.  I have only noticed the problem on my windows 7 desktop, but that could be because my laptops are normally only on at work or school.  Thanks in advance, and let me know what other information might be needed.
My network consists of a windows 7 Desktop, Linux mint laptop, and a macbook pro. My router is a Netgear N600, and here's my output of ipconfig /all
Here's a youtube video of where to find that in your router's settings if you are having problems: http://youtu.be/beTp_YYNOxo
As it turns out, my disconnects were from my ISP not having a large enough pipeline for my neighborhood, and they also had to replace the switch I was on.  The errors make sense now that I know what the problem was, but I really didn't expect this since I couldn't even tracert to my ISP (which was because the initial switch I was on was going in and out at the same time.)  Thanks for all of the help, but my ISP has fixed both problems now (they are a super small ISP, with like 10 employees total).
