The problem is that php 7.3 from Ondrej repo works only with mpm_prefork mode. He has git repo, so you can find him in net and ask him, will he make php 7.3 for mpm_worker and mpm_event.
The source of the problem seems to be a change in mod_rewrite of Apache 2.4.25. I've used Apache trace1 log level to observe a "loop" that pass $1 to php-fpm after index.php/$1 has been passed. The $1 generate the "AH01071: Got error 'Primary script unknown\n'" error.
Basically you setup a handler for the entire server that will catch any php scripts and pass them to fast-cgi.

Best way to solve this is to turn on debugging logs for mod_proxy and mod_rewrite and php-fpm. In apache 2.4 you can now turn on debugging logs for specific modules only.
Next edit SSL site (In this case certbot from Let's Encrypt has been installed and configured previously at the beginning of the SSL cert configuration).

This works with Wordpress 5.1.1 and newer together with PHP 7.3, FastCGI , proxy, also MariaDB/MySQL. Checked twice on my servers. Works like a charm.
