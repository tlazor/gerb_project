The Microsoft Windows Service Control Manager controls the state (i.e., started, stopped, paused, etc.) of all installed Windows services. By default, the Service Control Manager will wait 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds) for a service to respond. However, certain configurations, technical restrictions, or performance issues may result in the service taking longer than 30 seconds to start and report ready to the Service Control Manager.
Well, Windows can stop these services if they are not needed or if there is an instruction to stop the service after whatever it is doing. Some services depends on other services and they will only start when the first calls them.

By editing or creating the ServicesPipeTimeout DWORD value, the Service Control Manager timeout period can be overridden, thereby giving the service more time to start up and report ready to the Service.
Reporting Server Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion
For me when having this problem, changing "This account" in "Properties>Log On" for the service, to a network name in the form "MyDomain\MyUser" from "MyUser@MyDomain.xxx.yy", solved the issue, although I have no explanation why. â€“ MBWise Mar 14 '18 at 13:07
An error can cause the service to stop prematurely too. You could go to the Event Logger and see if there are errors related to these services. If there is a "(Triggered start)" after it, these services usually are not required or they only start when it is needed to, for example, Biometric services.
