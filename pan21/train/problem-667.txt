P.S: I can't disagree with @BaronSamedi1958: 2-node Storage Spaces Direct is a weak setup. I don't recommend using it in any serious production.
I'd strongly recommend to bring in at least third or better third and fourth nodes (yes, expensive!) for a fully fault-tolerant S2D cluster. Remember: Microsoft started with 4-node requirement, and brought 3-node & 2-node much later after numerous requests. 
Is it correct that one is able to use this reserve space as storage at the price of missing in-place recovery?
Also, I currently have 6x1TB SSD and 2x2TB SSD. What is the best way to devide them between both nodes (for S2D only, no OS drive(s))
Yes. You will be able to keep up and running while S2D rebalances itself using reserve space. Theoretically, this can save you from data loss in case you wasn't able to replace failed drive in time, and the second drive failure occurred after S2D finished rebalancing. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to find any detailed description of this feature and it's impact on the number of drive failures S2D can tolerate. The chances of loosing your data after the second drive failure are still pretty high.
I think you'll have an issue. During one node being down say for maintenance (patch Tuesday?) you don't have anybody to sync your data with, so disk failure will represent catastrophic results. Same thing is going to happen in case of a double disk failure: one disk died and S2D rebalances it using free space, and now second disk dies and you have a data loss. 
If I understood correctly, reserve space is only being used for in-place recovery in case a disk fails.
