On a side note, what other things should I double check for security? I have Apache, MySQL and ProFTPD running.
I have an SSH installed on my Ubuntu server. I can log into it from my Ubuntu desktop, using a user and a password. I can only access SSH from my LAN, since the SSH port is not forwarded on my router. Do I need to set up an RSA key for a setup like this? From what I understand the SSH is secure since it cannot be accessed from the Internet.
If your server is only accesible via your LAN, and your not worried about people gaining access to it, by WiFi hacks, or physical network access, then username/password authentication is probabley good enough.
Setup keys with passwords. Then use keychain, the only time you will ever have to enter passwords will be after a reboot. All the security of passwords, all the convenience of keys.
If your sure that only authorised users can get access to your LAN, then a username and password should suffice. Nothing is ever going to be completely secure, you need to ask yourself, is it good enough? 
Do you need to use keys?  No.  But it sure becomes a lot more convenient to use them once you have more then one server, or if you ever have to script some kind task that will require ssh access.
