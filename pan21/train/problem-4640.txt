I didn't wade through all the rant you linked, but the author doesn't seem to understand the watchdog.
There is also a watchdog daemon which you can configure to activate the watchdog; you should be able to start with sudo systemctl enable watchdog
In and of itself this does little, although it should restart the system if not "kicked" regularly. You can write code which opens /dev/watchdog to kick it off.
Power is a system service/daemon in pi and is string parsed by an IC directly pin out/fanouted to the Broadcom IC. Operation workflow can be altered by referring to system files but from what I can tell you are trying to invoke periperhials in custom power regulation scenarios within the concept of interrupts and watchdog timers. You can alter some portion of this behavior by repinning the regulating IC and doing some pre-boot bare metal programming. Check out these and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have something in mind. check out ARM Corp. Assembly reference line instruction set as well as architecture documentation. It’s on the web.
