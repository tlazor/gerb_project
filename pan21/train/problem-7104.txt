I have an external hard drive formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). I had been using it with my Macbook OS X for a long time. There are many files on this hard drive that are titled with Korean characters.
Now back on my Mac, if I rename the korean file to an english name, the file can be seen no problem by my linux machine. Also, if I then rename the file to a korean name on my LINUX machine (remember, my linux machine also has korean support), then the linux machine has no problem recognizing or reading it, but now the MAC will not be able to recognize the file. That is, if I go in with my Mac now and try to open the file via the gui, the file (really actually a directory) is empty. If I try to cd into the file via the command line it says that it gives me a "no such file or directory" error. But doing an ls gives no errors.
In short, it seems that if I try to name a file with a foreign-language on my mac, my linux won't recognize it, and if I try to do it with my linux, my mac won't recognize it. The only way for the two computers to both be able to use the external hard drive seems to be if all the files are named in English. I want to avoid renaming my hundreds of Korean files to English names. Is there anyone who knows what might be going on here, or point me to a direction which might help me tackle this?
Recently I got a new computer and installed Xubuntu 11.04 on it, along with Korean language support. Using the GUI I can mount the external hard drive and see only those files that aren't titled in Korean. The ones titled in Korean don't even show up. Now if I go into the hard drive via the command line, and ls the drive, I do get a listing of the Korean files with their Korean names, but only after an error message for each one of those files that goes like "ls: cannot access : No such file or directory".
