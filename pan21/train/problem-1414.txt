Wildly divergent answer, but possibly good for your particular needs: have you considered a SlingBox?   I know of at least one software app that claims to let you record the stream, and this has the added bonus of you being able to do it from any machine, anywhere, anytime.  
EDIT: Oops, the HD SlingBox only has component input, but odds are any HDTV has component output, or an HDMI->component converter is not hard or especially expensive to find.
HDMI has been out for some time now, but none of the usual companies I deal with seem to have a HDMI TV card, so I guess they just are not mainstream.
The HDMI ports on laptops is linked to the graphics card and is strictly video OUTPUT, designed to put your display out to a TV, Projector or other display device.
Which country do you live in?  If it one that uses the DVB-T/C standard, you could use DVBLink Server Network Pack, which will allow you to do what it appears you want to do.  I use it to view television on my laptop (even when at the pub) and main workstation computer, streaming from the TV card in my HTPC.  You can even change channels remotely.
