Now I would like to map each user's Zimbra's Briefcase folder when the user logs in using WebDAV. We added: net use Z: https://mail.ourserver.com/dav/user/Briefcase /u:user to our batch script, however, it only works after the user has manually entered their password into the open command prompt.
Obviously, what I want to be able to do here is mount the drive using the Windows login credentials, and without prompting for the password a second time after they have already logged in. Using net use Z: https://our.server.com/dav/user/Briefcase /u:user password works, but we do not have access to the user's plain text password and is therefore not an option.
A bit of context, we have several Windows 7 clients connected to an LDAP backed Samba PDC. We also have a Zimbra 8 server that authenticates off the same LDAP. When users logon to the Windows 7 clients, a batch script maps number of network drivers on the Samba server. All this is working well.
So my question is, how does AuthForwardServerList actually work? Does it only work with Windows servers, does the server have to support NTLM, or will any work with any WebDAV server using BasicAuth? Does it only work with IE and not with Windows Explorer? 
Alternatively, is there any way I can access the password the user just used to login to the machine, and somehow pass it to the script? The script is dynamically generated on the samba server and executed on the client, so even if the password can be captured in plain text on the server, it would be possible to append it to the script.
I came across the AuthForwardServerList registry key mentioned in this KB article, that is supposed to solve a similar problem when connecting to SharePoint servers over WebDAV. I tried adding the registry key with the value https://*.ourserver.com and various combinations of it, restarted the machine, but this seems to have no effect. net use still prompts for the password, and so does the "Map Network Drive" option in Windows Explorer.
