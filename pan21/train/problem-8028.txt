You can download Windows 8 or 8.1 from Windows legally as long as you have a genuine product key.  Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows8 and download the media creation tool + ISO (if you cannot download through this website then let me know and I will direct you to other links).  You will have to do this from a friend's computer.  Remember to backup all your files before formatting the drive.
Once you have gone through the whole process of installing, Windows should activate automatically.  However, if it does not activate automatically, press windows+R and type slui 3 into the run bar.  This will allow you to run activation again.
You can try reinitializing the slui activation system - Press windows+R and type slui 3 into the run bar.  This will allow you to run activation again and reenter your activation code.
However, since your system reset did not complete properly, the problems you are seeing are probably a result of a corrupt or failed installation.  I recommend you do a clean installation of Windows 8.
