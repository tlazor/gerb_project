For microfacet BRDFs, the usual simplifying assumption is that individual microfacets are perfect specular reflectors. Then, given the $L$ and $V$ at which to evaluate, the only microfacets that can contribute are those that are aligned along $H = \text{normalize}(L+V)$, because that's the only way they can reflect light from the incoming to the outgoing ray.
There are a couple cases where this argument gets modified. One is if the microfacet model assumes something other than perfect specularity. For instance, the Oren-Nayar BRDF assumes Lambertian microfacets. In this case the BRDF has to incorporate some kind of integral over all the possible microfacet orientations that can scatter light from $L$ to $V$. Then the BRDF won't have a standard Fresnel factor at all; it'll have some other formula that approximates the result of integrating the Fresnel factor over the normal hemisphere.
The normal distribution function and the visibility factor in the BRDF together approximate the density of microfacets oriented along $H$ that are visible from both the $L$ and $V$ directions. The Fresnel factor is evaluated for those microfacets, so the correct angle to use is the one between $L$ and $H$, or equivalently $V$ and $H$.
The other case that comes up in real-time graphics is the reflection from an environment map. To be really correct, we should integrate the environment map multiplied by the BRDF over all incoming light directions, but in practice we often sample a prefiltered environment map using the dominant reflection vector $R = \text{reflect}(V, N)$ and then multiply it by some approximate Fresnel formula that depends on the angle between $R$ and $N$ (equivalently $V$ and $N$), as well as the surface roughness. This is very much an approximation, but often good enough for real-time use.
It's not. The BRDF in itself does not approximate the integral over all the hemisphere. The rendering equation does that: you integrate over all incoming light directions, but each time the BRDF inside the integral is evaluated, it's for one specific choice of incoming and outgoing ray directions.
