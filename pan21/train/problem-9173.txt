Here is a link to Bill's "Apps of Ramsey Theory" page: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/ramsey/ramsey.html
The classical problem in Ramsey theory is the party problem, which asks the minimum number of guests  that must be invited so that at least m will know each other (i.e., there exists a clique of order m) or at least n will not know each other (i.e., there exists an independent set of order n). Here, R(m,n) is called a Ramsey number.
There seems to be a slew of research in the field. What are some real world applications? For example, I read in one place that circuit/network routing would be a good one. But how why is that? Does anyone know of any other real world applications?
A course I'm currently taking from Bill Gasarch is called: Ramsey Theory and Its 'Applications' -- the quotes are in the official course title. Interpret that as you wish. >_>
The latter link is very likely the most complete collection of information for the question you're asking.
