Currently I am using ffmpeg: ffmpeg -loop 1 -i input.png -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -r 24 -threads 128 -t 1 output.mp4
BTW I am using linux, I have access to a gaming card (although it might not be useful, as mentioned earlier). I am limited to FOSS/free software at this time - no payed applications. Preferably I would like to do this in ffmpeg. I have an NVME SSD drive so I'm not expecting data read to be a bottleneck, but maybe it is?
I have a large 8k 360 degree image file that I recently rendered. For showcasing purposes, I want to convert this into a few minutes of video so people can view it in youtube's VR 360 viewer. However, this is turning out to be an exceedingly slow process.
This only gives me around 1FPS on my (reasonably fast) laptop, and a few more on my more powerful desktop CPU. I have tried using GPU, however FFMPEG errored out saying that my GTX card couldn't handle the 8192x8192 image. So, I'm currently stuck with hours of encoding for a few minutes of video - are there any faster ways of doing this?
