After reading through D-Link's website, Green Ethernet seems to be mostly marketing. I do say mostly because there is potential to save energy, but some of the features they mention are already used in other pieces of technology. So, perhaps the "turning off the port to save energy" is a good idea in theory, but I think it makes some bad assumptions about how some other devices work and is more of a pain than practical.
The other thought is to get your Shuttle to force a data packet out somehow (manual ping to 127.0.0.1 for example) to present some sort of electrical activity on the port.
I haven't read the manual yet so I can't tell you how to do it, but see if you can turn off the Green Networking for the one port your Shuttle is connected to (and leave the auto-negotiation on) and see what happens.
I'm willing to bet that your router is waiting to hear what kind of link whatever is connected to it is going to run at to turn the port on, and seeing that your Shuttle is waiting to hear what speed it's supposed to run at will keep waiting because the port is turned off!
