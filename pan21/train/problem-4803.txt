Only adding room mailbox to user mailbox account will work for reminder on calendar. Here are the test result:
User1 adds room mailbox as additional account. Then user3 books a meeting on room1, And user3 will receive this
The idea is, that everyone should be able to send a meeting request to the calendar and this should be accepted automatically. If a team member has this Exchange account configured in his Outlook profile, he should get the corresponding reminders.
We are using an Exchange 2013 environment with Outlook 2010. I've already re-created the account multiple times and gave a few PowerShell cmdlets a shot, set DisableReminders to $false, set the DefaultReminderTime to something other than 15 minutes and so on.
Then user3 book a meeting on Room1, on user1's mailbox, reminder is configured to none on this calendar.
Unfortunately, the room mailbox seems to automatically set the reminders of accepted meetings to "None", rendering my whole effort useless.
Even if you got the reminders to stay on, it wouldn't work. You only get reminders for your mailbox, not additional mailboxes.
