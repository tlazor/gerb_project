My dad brought this to my attention and I'm looking into it, but thought I'd post here and see if anyone has any ideas...
I pulled up the same page in Ubuntu, Firefox, and it displayed in my print preview and physically printed everything correctly.  I just checked on my wife's Win7 PC in Firefox and the print preview looked correct on her system, too.  We have a Brother 2040 here.
He's running Win7, using Firefox and printing to a wireless connected Brother HL-2170W printer.  He's got a web page (http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/inputs/fertilizer/applying-nitrogen-after-planting-0512/index.html) that has extended/special characters in it - the funny "a" in Fernandez.  The characters show correctly in Firefox on the page.  He printed it, and the extended "a" printed as a diamond with a question mark.  He says it shows that way in the print preview, too.
Soooo, my question is, is this possibly a problem in the browser somehow, or the printer driver?  I'm leaning towards the printer driver now, but I can't say I've run into this before.  Is it a setting somewhere?  I just installed this printer for him the other day, using the CD that came with it; I could try updating the driver from Brother's website I guess.
