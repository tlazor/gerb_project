There is no such thing as "the Windows API" so it is not possible to answer your question directly.  
Some of these API's are very generic and exist in almost every version of Windows, others exist only in certain versions.
E.g. There are API interfaces in Windows to communicate with the NIC drivers at the level of individual ethernet packages. That doesn't mean all Windows API's live in the network layer.
What is generally called "the Windows API" is the total of all API's provided by Microsoft present on a given version of Windows.
The layers of the 7-layer model can not clearly be isolated in a Windows environment and various Windows subs-systems and API's cross the boundaries between the OSI layers in many places.
What exactly constitutes "the Windows API" is therefore not really clear. It is a very vague term.  
As others have already mentioned in the comments: Your question as it stands is way to broad. If you are interested in a specific API on Windows this can probably be answered.
This is in fact true for most modern Operating Systems. Strict adherence to the OSI layers is VERY difficult to do in a real OS, especially if you want to achieve good networking performance at the same time.
To further focus on your question regarding the interaction with the OSI model. Windows networking is mainly focused on the TCP/IP model and (roughly) follows the simplified OSI model (4 layers).
