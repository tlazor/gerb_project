I'm not that big of a fan when it comes to administrating DNS via the windows gui, aside from convential A records and CNAME aliases and the integration with AD the rest could use some improvement.
(This is yet another example of why naming your AD domain the same as a valid Internet domain name is not a good idea.)
if you have access to the root ns, if it's linux by any chance you can edit the named.conf and specify the authoritive DNS server to respond to queries for this domain.
The "proper way" to add the MX record is through either the "DNS Management" snap-in or from one of the various command-line tools that can manipulate the Microsoft DNS server.
The problem is your domain is probably registered with an enterprise root NS.  When querying a record it will check there first. Just out of curiosity are the machines using the same DNS servers for name resolution or another source? 
Check to see if you are running a split brain DNS.  Basically the DNS servers you are querying are authoritative for the DNS domain but not the server that are running the AD DNS.  It's likely that when you decided to simplify your active directory DNS structure the admins left 1 set of dns for external purposes and another for internal. and did not set up replication between them
Talk to your "Windows admin" again and be sure they understand what you're asking for. If they've added the record but it's still not "showing up" they need to double-check that AD replication (I'm going out on a limb and assuming that the DNS zone is "AD integrated") is working properly to the DNS server computers.
