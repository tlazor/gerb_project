However, searching from many Outlook clients fails when using server-side searches.  Outlook will spin for a while, and then error with "It looks like there's a problem with your network connection."  
OWA works flawlessly, including searching.  So I know the Exchange Fast Search service / subsystem is working correctly.

You say this is Outlook 2019, but is it MSI based (Retail/OEM/VL) or Click-To-Run based (Office 365)?
I've tried rebuilding the Windows Search Index on a couple computers, and that didn't fix it.  I can use GPO / registry to force client-side only, but it'd be much better to find the cause of this and get server-side searching working between Outlook & Exchange 2019.
Internal & external DNS / autodiscovery updated, and clients find the new server and connect to their mailboxes without issue.
All arbitration, public & user mailboxes transferred successfully, and Exchange 2013 decommissioned/uninstalled.
