just to confirm the answer given in the comments above by ehiller has fixed this for me also - I have a creative X-fi XtremeMusic card 
I did a clean Windows 10 64-bit Pro install back in August/September timeframe. Nothing fixed it, new drivers, nothing.
Amazingly it did fix it. But then the crackling came back. Well what the hell? I had paid just enough attention to notice that it had only come back when the "scanning music directories for updates" stopped. Before you think Hard Disk driver or issue, my music is on an SMB/samba mount so that should be a non issue. But I did know the CPU usage went up during that time. I repeated this above about 5 times. Finally a repeatable pattern Something I could work with (You might be able to tell I am getting a bit excited by now). So I checked for a cpu load generator - used this one from Microsoft blog and proceeded testing, here are my results...
I probably re-listened to the youtube video about 20 times, then I hit replay one more time and that time there was no crackling... So no more tests, sorry. 
I had noticed that sometimes if I closed and re-opened MediaMonkey (which I use for music library management and playback) it would fix the issue. So I figured what the hell, even though that made little sense...
I have been trying to track down an intermittent crackling audio issue for YEARS now to no avail. I've checked DPC, memory pagefiles, etc... back when I was running Win7 -- which also had the issue (same hardware):
Then This morning I was randomly listening to a youtube video someone sent me, crackling right away. Just randomly occurs, sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't.
