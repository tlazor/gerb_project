Also keep in mind that if you want official support from Apple, you need OS X Server. In business situations, this is a major reason to choose server.
It's also much less expensive -- the amount you'll pay for a Mac OS X client/server would buy you a very capable Web server from Dell, HP, IBM, etc.
So if you need a management interface take Mac OS X Server, if your are comfortable with command line Mac OS X will do the job as well as the Server version.
In addition to management tools, Server also comes pre-installed with several things that a web server may need, like MySQL and PHP (Actually, client may come with PHP now... but it doesn't come with MySQL) There may be other things like that that come with Server, but those are the ones that I personally use...
I'm with Farseeker on this: any Linux or BSD distro is going to be arguably "better" at hosting Apache than Mac OS X client or server, because the "server" flavor of Ubuntu is very stripped down, even more so with one of the BSDs.  I can't say what it would take to pare down OS X Server for a Web server only role, but running ps waux on my Mac OS X laptop compared to my Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Web server tells me that you're likely going to spend some time getting it where you want/need it to be.
The advantage of Server verses Client is as radius said: Server has management tools whereas Client does not. But using google and the command line CLient can be made to do just about everything Server can. (I have an OS X Client machine acting as a file server, DHCP server, Name Server and Netboot Server)
Both Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server come with Apache and are capable of acting as web servers. I used to manage an OS X Server machine which acted as a web and file server, handling over 10 requests/second without any issue.
In your case the difference between Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server will be additional management tool for the underlying web server (apache).
