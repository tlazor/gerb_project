There are lots of free/open source monitoring solutions available that will do this, my personal favourite is Nagios.
I know that some monitoring solutions can do that already, but i wonder if something simplier (and preferably cheap / free of course !) exists.
As i can't check the computers every time a meeting ends, i'd like to find a tool, preferably running on windows, that can monitor some cisco switch ports state, and every time a cable is being unplugged, send me an email. 
Edit: Sorry, Nagios actually runs on Linux, but this wikipedia page will help you find a monitoring system that runs on Windows.
Whilst you're at it, you might as well get Nagios monitoring your servers and other network devices too!
I don't know about monitoring the state of a switch port, but you can certainly monitor ICMP echo response of the device connected to the port.
Not exactly state of the art but written mostly as a proof of concept, the following could be used to detect when a host goes down. Add it in a regular cronjob, modify it so it emails you everytime something is down and voila! Cheap n' quick solution.
Net::SNMP module for perl can do that. Take a look at Perl for system administrators(linked chapter handles SNMP) for some practical examples. Be sure to check out the module itself at cpan.
