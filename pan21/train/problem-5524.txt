I am a Linux user, I mainly use RedHatArc and ubuntu/debian.  I want to start using Unix's for servers instead of Fed/Cent.  I have tried but never successfully installed FreeBSD. I haven't tried NetBSD yet (DLing the ISO now), and have not gotten a copy of OpenBSD in my hands yet.  
99% of the time the best answer is "whichever you're most comfortable administrating that also fits your needs".
In all fairness, all of the Unixes have been so deeply impacted by Linux and other GNU code, that they are much less "True Unix" than they were 10 years ago.
I was hoping to get some input from various Unix users here on the applicable differences with the free Unix's.  Not so much the differences in the actually implementations, but more the best end uses for each one.
FreeBSD for a "balanced" system: desktop/server, probably the biggest community, lots of information about it.
The only true Unixes left in the marketplace are HP-UX, SCO, AIX and Solaris.  The BSD products listed in this thread are not Unix -- they are merely "Unix-like".
Do you have needs that Linux can't fulfill?  Do you simply want the perceived prestige of running a true Unix?  Is a PHB trying to tell you how to do your job?
