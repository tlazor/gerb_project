There had been a recent TeamViewer connection to my PC, and the issue manifested during that connection.  However, since the problem persisted following the cessation of the connection, and since restarts did not solve the issue, TeamViewer was too quickly ruled out as the suspect.
Be that as it may, I uninstalled TeamViewer on the Host Machine (the one stuck on French), and my proper keyboard layout was restored!  When I re-installed TeamViewer, the problem did not return.
My best guess as to the actual cause would be a corrupt TeamViewer resource that was translating the local input and bouncing it back to the local machine instead of a connected host.  Almost like TeamViewer was looped into itself, behaving like both remote and host simultaneously.
TeamViewer has options to translate keystrokes over the connection.  Normally I would think this is handled at the remote side, and not the host side, meaning that the TeamViewer remote transmits the translated character, so the host only sees the translated character and not the original typed character.  Given that information, you can see how it was natural to rule out TeamViewer as the cause.
