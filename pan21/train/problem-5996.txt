WARNING!!!!!!! CAUTIONARY note on running Eclipse native on the PI.  If you use apt-get to install eclipse, it will also install Open JDK and set eclipse to use it.  Open JDK is extremely slow when compared with Oracle's JDK so be sure to install oracle Java and use it.
Some have asked the question before and there are various responses, however none directly answered the question and so here it is again.  Appreciate any pointer.
So it is possible but I'd recommend to just run Eclipse on your desktop device or laptop and just transfer the built files or source code to your Raspberry Pi.
I have used Eclipse on the Raspberry PI models 2 and 3 and found the performance to be quite good when doing Java development with pi4j when using Oracle's Java 8. It is a bit slow to load (15 seconds or so) and you will notice a slight delay the first time any new item (editor, builder, etc) is run (presumably class loading), but once up and running, it runs pretty smoothly.  When debugging I/O device drivers etc, having it run native on the PI is great.
