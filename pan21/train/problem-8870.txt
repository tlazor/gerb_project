Alternatively, you can set the umask for all sftp logins in sshd's config file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config on my Debian box).  For that add -u 022 to the sftp subsystem line like so:
I've spent considerable time searching for a more complete answer to this question. Configuring a different umask for sftp is well and good, but it is not a universal answer, since the umask will only restrict permissions and not grant additional ones. What exact permissions a file uploaded via sftp end up with depend also on the permissions of the original source file, and on the client used for the upload.
To attempt two methods that would address this, though in both cases they are  more workarounds than solutions:
As neat as this is, I would still be very interested in a way, by feature or trickery, to obtain the same result within sftp or at least the shell, without involving separate utilities.
The permission files are created with depends on your umask. To get 644 permissions, set your umask to 022 (umask 022).
To make this change permanent, put that command in the remote servers ~/.profile (depending on your shell).
I came upon a blog post at positon.org which nicely explains the inotify option, with examples and even init scripts. It's best read there, but in the event the site ever disappears, the key command is:
As an example, I've set the umask on my (OpenSSH, on a Red Hat server) sftp server to 0002, but if I upload a text file with 0600 permissions on the source system using the OpenSSH sftp client, it will still have 0600 permissions at the destination. Notably this means I cannot, to the best of my knowledge, ensure that files uploaded to this sftp server have any group permissions at all, which by extension means I also cannot use access control lists (ACL) to extend permissions to other users or groups.
