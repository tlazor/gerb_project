You don't need RDMA and stuff to make a cluster work.  If you're interested in the clustering stuff (instead of just wanting your VMs to work) you can use something like OpenMOSIX with what you've got and you'll be able to run parallel jobs.  Will it compete in the Top500?  No.  Will it be a fun project?  Maybe :)
Technically yes, but you'll need an InfiniBand RDMA network and some expensive commercial software like ScaleMP. Expect to spend several tens of thousands of dollars on top of the server hardware you plan to aggregate.
Hope this explanation helps. If someone does figure out a way to aggregate multiple hosts into a unified VM-hosting platform, I'm pretty sure they'll clean up. It's pretty much a virtualization holy grail ;)
For this, you're going to want to google for "Xen" "migration".  If you want to do it while the virtual machines are running, you're looking for "live" migration.
You can configure each host to support virtual machines. However each individual VM cannot execute on more than one host simultaneously. Each VM is restricted to the resources available within its host server.
You can 'Live Migrate' a VM from one server to another without bringing the VM offline. However as above, at any one time you only have the resources of a single host available to the VM.
With the resources you have, you may be better served by taking the RAM and CPUs from two of the hosts and using them to stack the other hosts as fully as possible (2 x dual-processor, 8Gb hosts). Then set those more powerful hosts up to host VMs. This relies on there being enough RAM and CPU slots spare within the hosts to expand them.
Practically, no, clustering doesn't (usually) work like that and can't just aggregate CPU and memory resources into a single logical machine image.
