I realize this is a 4 year old question at this point. But I figured I'd add a new answer since there are currently no other up-voted ones.
The regular expression actually makes things more complicated than they might need to be though. If your files all have the exact same naming pattern of app_<DATE>.log, you can skip the Regex and simplify by letting ParseExact do all the work like this. You just need to escape the literal characters in the format string by surrounding them with single quotes.
The way I'd go about this is parsing the date into an actual DateTime object from the file name. Then you can use normal date comparisons rather than string comparisons. The most common way to do this is using a Calculated Property as part of a Select-Object statement. In the example below, we add a calculated property called ParsedDate to the existing output.
Technically speaking, you could also do the date parsing inside the Where clause and skip the intermediate Select clause. But I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
