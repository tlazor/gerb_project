If your clocksource is set to jiffies certain processors do not stay in sync with one another, leading to a situation where the time on one processor differs from the time on another processor. It can be out be a difference of only 1 second for this to cause a problem in mysql.
Be sure that the address is correct and that you have the necessary privileges, or try increasing the connection timeout (currently 10 seconds).
Looks like you're having issues connecting through SSH or maintaining the SSH tunnel, these errors are usually reported to /var/log/auth.log. Probably SequelPRO tries to use a connection that is no longer available, stalled.
The bug I came across here was that one processor was 1 second out from the other processor. This lead to a condition where mysql would ask for the time, then compare the time again with the next new request (which was -1 second away). Given this is unexpected it would underflow and mysql thought the connection was four billion seconds older than what it was.
Each line should report the same result, certainly not a second out. You should try it a few times to make sure you just didnt cross a 1 second threshold during the test.
If this is the problem, you should change the clocksource on the host from jiffies to tsc, hpet or acpi and the problem should go away.
I often experience I am unable to connect to the MySQL server through SequelPRO. If I ssh into the server, I can use mysql fine, see processes, etc. My web app works fine too.
ONLY solution is to reboot the server. Sometimes I’d reboot the server, and it still won’t work. After a few reboots it works. But usually it works every time.

You may also try to manually set the SSH tunnel: http://www.sequelpro.com/docs/Set_up_an_SSH_Tunnel — if this works, then it's surely a bug/problem with SequelPro SSH connection.
