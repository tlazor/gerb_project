Yes, you can power the Pi from the hub with an extra usb to micro usb cable coming from the hub to the PWR input on the Zero. This shouldn't cause any problems whatsoever, no feedback. 
This is back powering, and it is pretty safe on the Raspberry Pi, as long as your USB hub doesn't surge over 5.25V, which I've never seen a hub do. So I'd say this is very safe, but I'm sure someone's got a story about breaking their Pi like this, as there is no polyfuse for the current to go through when back powering.
You really don't need that extra cable going to the PWR input anyways. With most powered hubs you should be able to just plug the hub's power in and plug the data cable of the hub into the Zero. Without plugging anything into the PWR port, it should boot up.
An externally powered hub should be more than capable of powering both your Pi Zero and whatever peripherals you want to connect with it.  The RPi itself only requires ~200 mA of power with a full load. That number will be significantly less under lighter situations.
