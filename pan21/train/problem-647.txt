We currently deploy the vast majority of the software in our university user labs via AD group policy.  Firefox is included.  The caveat is that we also repackage most of the vendors' installers using tools like InstallShield AdminStudio.  Regarding Firefox specifically, we don't technically enforce any settings.  But we do pre-configure a default profile with university specific stuff that gets added to user local profiles when they login for the first time.  We manage the updates by simply repackaging the new version and replacing what is deployed.
The main benefit to the FrontMotion version (at least the last time I tried it) was that they've modified the source so that some of the settings are enforceable via normal GP admin templates.  We briefly used their version, but ultimately decided the settings enforcement wasn't necessary for our situation.
I honestly don't think you're ever going to be able to completely replace IE in a Windows environment.  But it's not that hard to make alternatives easy to access.
