So the question is, is SpeedFan making some of the values up? How many temperature sensors does a modern computer usually have?
The CPU temps are routinely around 90C, since I play games a lot. Idling, on OS X the CPU Diode is about 40C normally, and under Windows it's about 50C. (I'm not sure why, it just runs warmer in Windows. I can feel the case is warmer too, so it's not measuring a different sensor)
Newer Speedfan versions (valid for other software, too) often learn how to read more and new sensors, so finding more sensors with updates is no surprise.
DIMM temperature is uncommon, but if speedfan is showing it then likely you have a sensor for it on the system; if the sensor is missing but for some reason speedfan shows it in the list, it will show as 0 or -127 or something obviously wrong on most occasions.
Something he said was very interesting "a previous version of this SpeedFan showed only 3 temperature measurements"
My friend's laptop suddenly froze, after he rebooted (the machine was given a chance to cool down a bit) he launched an application called SpeedFan and it gave the following:
CPU Diode, CPU Digital Core 0, CPU Digital Core 1, CPU Proximity, Integrated Graphics chip, RAM, disk bay, (the actual disk also has a sensor), battery, and there are also a couple more that aren't related to any specific component (case sensors)
That seems about right. but generally ignore the fire icons, 43 degrees on a laptop is pretty acceptable; in a rack mounted server however, it would be considered very hot.
temp1 is likely a motherboard/case-temp sensor. and CPU is usually an average of the core0+core1 or it may be a third sensor that checks the entire CPU package temp.
I was surprised by the number of temperature measurements the program showed, last time I checked (4-5 years ago) I was able only able to see the CPU temperature with a similar application.
