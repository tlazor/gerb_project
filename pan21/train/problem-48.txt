Hope that this helps anyone who has fallen into the same trap.(Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, if I'm leading people astray)
Run the shell script from terminal and if there is an error in code, you'll see.. Other method... I don't know. I read on that site that the a visitor said that the script is buggy. 
You can also try the script from the official documentation for Raspberry, http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md. Hope that they're not identical.
Presumably :0 was already taken by the GUI that was loading automatically, since I wasn't running headless.
I'm a bit of a unix neophyte myself and I had a similar problem. I followed the instructions that you're pointing to and it just wouldn't start the vnc server. I finally realised that the error message about 0 being locked (which I assume is effectively 'GUI' 0) was telling me exactly why it wasn't working. As soon as I changed the script in init.d to :1 rather than :0 it worked perfectly.
I have model b+ and I've installed tightvncserver, and can successfully start the VNC manually, but once I reboot I need to start it again, although I have configured it to start automatically, by following the instructions here word by word.
