First off, I wasn't sure if this was a question better suited to Super User or one of the other communities like Cross Validated, so please let me know if this is in the wrong place.
This shows up in Task Manager with the new little green leaf symbol as seen here. The leaf icon shows up in Task Manager next to Apps/Background processes that have at least one sub-process that is suspended, which you can see when you expand the list on the process tab of Task Manager OR if you look at the blue/ 'Status: Suspended' processes in Resource Monitor.
I've looked for info on whether other people are having the same issue specifically with RStudio and didn't find anything useful. I also searched for general information on how to tell Windows 10 not to suspend a particular app.
I am using RStudio (Version 1.1.453 / R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing") with the 'enhanced R distribution from Microsoft (Microsoft R Open 3.5.0, CRAN mirror snapshot taken on 2018-06-01) on Windows 10 (Version  10.0.17134 Build 17134).
I'm having an issue where while I am actively using RStudio, Windows 10 suspends the Rstudio App process and RStudio freezes.
