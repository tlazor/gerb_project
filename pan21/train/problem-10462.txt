I'd take the drive, attach it to a good system, and copy off what user data was left, put it back, then do a clean reinstall. That will give you a known good OS and I suspect it will be faster than trying to fix problems as you find them.
I have a problem... I was trying to rm -rf * one of my folders, but it turns out I was in the / directory... I stopped the command quickly but it still broke  A LOT of things. Almost all commands are broken... LS returns /usr/bin/LS not found... Is there some way that I can reinstall CentOS without loosing all of my data and just repairing what was broken? If there is anything I can do without loosing my data, I would REALLY appreciate it. I took lots of time setting up this server. Oh and I can mount ISO on the server...
If it is not on a separate partition, you can either move the drive to another computer as suggested by @Fred, or you can boot into a live CD and retrieve any remaining data from there. In any case, you will need to reinstall afterwards.
Is your /home on a separate partition? If so, you can reinstall, and use the same /home. Any data you have not deleted will still be there.
