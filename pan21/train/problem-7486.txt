You should reinstall, I agree. Have you tried escaping the characters in the path? Maybe one of those slashes is actually part of a filename and not a directory. At the very least you should use iptables to block outbound traffic to that host or IRC general until fixed. Check netstat as well.
But definitely take Arenstar's advice.  Back up data only, restore everything executable from backups, and start over.  You should probably restore the website from backups as well, there could be malicious javascript added to every html or php file.  If you're considering legal action, you'll want to just set the machine aside, unplug it from the net, and stop whatever it is you're doing until forensic experts have done their job.
I'd think by now you have reinstalled. Your justing wasting time trying to track the processes and do forensics as chances of anything legally developing from it would be very minute and chances of finding the hacker would be futile anyway. Unless it just interests you to research and reverse rootkits which can be fun:)  
This would be mostly academic and probably just a timewaster, but strings -n 10 /proc/[pid]/mem might be fun to watch scroll past.  You could also echo 0x7 > /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter and use gdb gcore to force a coredump with everything possible in it, but then the process dies, which could block further analysis.
ps auxwf | less gives you the "forest view" of processes which can show you what process launched this process (unless the rootkit is hiding it, or the app's parent has exited and it's been reparented to init).
