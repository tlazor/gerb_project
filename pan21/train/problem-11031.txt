and run the fix-it option, it will totally remove Office 2013 from your system.  Assuming that you have previously installed the fileformatconverters for your old Office 2003, then, when you reboot, it should all magically start working.  At least it did for me.  
I can't find in Word 2003 any place where I can see that it knows that the converters are even there, and looking on my reference XP machine is no help.
Of course I have done reinstalls, did the MS suggested key delete/repair routine, etc.  Nothing has any effect. 
I have Word 2003 SP3 with all updates and the latest FileFormatConverters and its SP installed on several machines, all running W10-64 Pro. In all cases the machines got to W10 by running the W7>W10, and in all cases that ran smoothly. In some cases Word 2003 (well, Office 2003) was installed before the upgrade, sometimes after. It makes no difference.
So, if you go to https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-Windows-computer-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US
When you do the W7 to W10 upgrade, Office 2013 is installed but not activated.  Except that it sort of is, since when you try to open a doc file, for example, Word 2013 steps in but then tells you it isn't installed.  Which is a bit of a lie.
In all cases, Word 2003 appears to run just fine EXCEPT that the docx converter (wordconvpxy) doesn't run. On one machine, I don't even get the message that says that wordconvpxy failed to start, it immediately just goes to showing junk.  Of course, W10 Wordpad works fine with docx so I can get at the files that way, but that's not a very appealing solution.
