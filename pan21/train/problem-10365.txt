I'm developing a small app on my own and I am trying to install a database on a local machine that I will be using for development.
I'd begin by testing/troubleshooting my connection string on the local SQL server, so that you're not traversing the router.  Once you can connect on the localhost, then you know that your connection string syntax is ok.  Then you can deal with the network/router issues.
This resumes what I have done as best as I remember as I have tried many things. My objective is to connect to the MYPROJECT1 using a connection string in visual studio; however I do not know how to format this connection string, so I am using a modified connection string took from another project which connects on a remote database which works (but is not located at home):
I need help troubleshooting to find the exact cause of the problem and FINALLY connect to my database remotely, this would mean a lot to me. If you have any questions in the process or think that there is information missing, feel free to ask.
