The NS records are themselves A records. There's an A record for ns1.acme.com and then you designate ns1.acme.com as the name server for the acme.com DNS zone. You can create any number of A records for the same ip address and designate those "names" as the name servers for any number of DNS zones, so the A records for ns1.acme.com and ns1.beta.com could resolve to the same ip address and both could be designated as the name server for their respective DNS zone.
I think you are overthinking this.  Why not just declare beta.com's nameserver to be ns1.acme.com? (or the other way around if you are getting rid of acme.com... does anyone ever get rid of a domain?)
As long as both NS are different there are no other restrictions. Multiple domains can use the same name servers.
That said, you obviously loose some redundancy if all your name servers are on one physical machine, but if you are splitting name servers between 2 machines, and just using the same IP for multiple domains, this is less of an issue. Your more likely to see hardware issues, than you are routing errors for a single IP.
You can have as many A records as you like pointing to the same IP, there is nothing in the DNS spec that will stop you.
