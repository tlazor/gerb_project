I've found lots of partial answers to this question but either I'm not implementing them correctly or they don't really match my problem. I have a column and in each cell there are two numbers separated by a colon. Each number can be one or two digits. (Examples: 1:1, 1:2, 12:10, 12:20, etc.) I need to query the cell and return one thing if the number to the left of the colon is smaller than the number on the right, and return something else if the number to the left is bigger than or equal to the number on the right. I have calculations to extract the numbers on each side of the colon:
What's frustrating me is that the calculations to extract the numbers on either side of the colon are working, and the calculation to determine which is bigger fails only when the first digit on the left side of the colon is smaller than the number on the right side, even if the left side number has a second digit and is therefore bigger. For example, for 12:3 it returns "Divider, " even though 12 is bigger than 3 and it should return "Combiner, ". But I know that it's seeing both digits of 12, because my equation to extract the left side number works. 
It is becuase LEFT,MID,RIGHT return a string and "3" is greater than "12" as text goes character by character.
In this example, the numbers with the colon are in cell E2. I have another calculation to compare the two numbers and return the desired result:
The idea is to return "Divider, " if the number to the left of the colon is smaller than the number to the right, and to return "Combiner, " if the number to the left is equal or larger.
