No, looking for 802.11 APs is primarily active. When you bring up a list of visible APs in the area, your 802.11 client most likely does what's known as an "active scan", where it tunes its radio to each supported channel in turn, transmits a Probe Request frame, and waits perhaps 20-40ms to gather Probe Response frames from any APs on that channel before moving on to the next channel. This allows it to scan all the channels much faster than a "passive scan".
Some channels in 5GHz in some regulatory regions require that you scan passively first, until you know that the channel is not in use by nearby radar installations. But most clients, as soon as they see a Beacon on a passive-scan channel, will switch to an active scan to speed up the process.
It's pretty trivial to learn people's wireless client MAC addresses and also the names of their home and work networks just by hanging out at the office or a coffee shop or airport terminal with an 802.11 monitor mode packet sniffer, recording Probe Requests.
A "passive scan" is possible, but isn't used very often because it takes longer. To do a passive scan, the client tunes to each channel in turn, and waits a typical Beacon Interval (usually about 100ms, but could be more) to gather Beacons.
If your client device is on, and hasn't given up looking for your recently-joined/preferred/remembered networks, it will almost certainly be broadcasting Probe Requests which give away not only your wireless MAC address and some of the capabilities of your card, but often also the name the network it's looking for. This is necessary in case the network is a "hidden" (a.k.a. "non-broadcast SSID", a.k.a. "closed") network.
