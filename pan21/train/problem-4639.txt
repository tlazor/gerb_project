I've tried everything to get it to work including the installation of SPII and running the user provisioning tool without any luck. The only way to fix it was to restart.
After any sql patches are applied make sure "netstat -an" shows port 1433 is listening.  If not, then re-enable the listener.
I think that Bart maybe on to something.  The title says SQL2005 on Vista.  Is it possible that Vista is limiting the number of connections, therefore tripping a limiter that affects TCP connections?   I know XP had a limit to how many connections were allowed, I think it was ten.  So if something grabs a connection and does not give it back, then restarting could be the 'solution'.  If you are running SQL2005 for production work, it really should be on a Server OS.    
Stop and restart the Sql Server Browser, Sql Server integration, SQL Server Active Directory Helper services.
Also, on Vista/Windows7 disabling UAC and then running the SQL service as the user with the disabled UAC (such as your current user) might help.
On my Vista machine at work, applications and the SQL Server Management Console work fine connecting to SQL Server 2005. Sometimes they are ok for weeks at a time, sometime for hours and then they stop connecting.
