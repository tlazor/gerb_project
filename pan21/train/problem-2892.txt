But it is possible if you do it right.  This is called Split DNS.  The trick is to include ALL names from the externally-hosted view in your internal view on the AD side, i.e., maintain the external view on the ISP nameservers as a proper subset of your internal view.  You have to add any new names to both views.  The IP addresses can be different internally vs externally (e.g., public vs. 10/8 space, NAT'd vs non-NAT'd), but the names must all exist internally so they are resolvable internally.
Is it possible to configure the DNS server to get to both external and internal domains with the same name? Have an ISP handling web site with the same domain name as my internal domain. DNS server apparently points to the external web site address.  Thus I cannot add a new user workstation ( System 7 Pro ) to the network, because the DNS is pointing to the external address and I get the cannot find the DNS server error.   Not sure what I did but initially I could add workstations but could not get to external web site.  Made changes and now able to get to website but now find I cannot add users to local domain. And not sure how I managed to do either. Thanks
This is likely the source of your trouble / misconception.  DNS looks for an answer internally and a response of "that name doesn't exists" is a valid answer and doesn't cause fallback to look at the external DNS servers.  This is why the external view must be a proper subset of the internal set of names for this to work correctly with no surprises.
