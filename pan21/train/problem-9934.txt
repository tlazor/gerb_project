In theory this is easy, since each folder belongs to a single server and writes within a folder can go to the server that has the parent folder. Unfortunately it would appear that UnionFS and OverlayFS do not support more than one read/write filesystem.
I have a OS drive and a Data drive in my system. My data drive that serves /var and /home, and it's mounted at /mnt/DataDrive.
Are there any ways to do this that I can't think of? I think 1,000 NFS mounts (one for each home directory) would not work terribly well and would be a pain to keep up to date.
Use autofs to automatically mount directories in use. With the use of wildcards, your /home map could look something like
What I'd like to do is to mount them (NFS or SSHFS) to a 7th server and merge them all together in to a single /home with full visibility to all of the 6 servers, and maintain read write.
If autofs does not work, consider mounting the entire share at /home in /etc/fstab. So listing of /home is a few thousand directories, but the number of mounts is fewer.
Create separate mount points for each server. Create symlinks for the home directory to the directory on the mount point.
I've got over 1,000 directories, spread out over 6 servers. Technically they are home folders. It's guaranteed that there will never be any duplicate folder names.
