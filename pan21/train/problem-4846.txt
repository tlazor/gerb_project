If the direct ethernet connection means you can maintain your connection, then you may be running on the same channel as someone else and interfering with each other, or that you have some other device causing interferance (Dect Phones and Microwave ovens both run on the 2.4Ghz frequency that wireless runs at).
You mentioned that you tried an Ethernet cable so it is usually not a client side problem. It could be a bad phone line in your area (soaked, bitten, something like that which does not damage the line completely) is anybody else in your area experiencing this?. 
I'm not sure if the situation is the same in China but if you have to use microfilters on your phone sockets it's worth checking that you have one in every socket that has a phone line plugged into it and try swapping them out.
From your question I'm not sure what's going on. From "clicking Reconnect" I presume that is not problem with physical layer and your link between PC and router is stable. So, please do some more research with these steps:
