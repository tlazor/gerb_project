I remember once, trying to connect to that router from some laptop, I believe, it asked me to press some button on the router. I believe this is some kind of alternative to using a password, but Windows 7 is just asking me to enter the password.
If you use Mozilla Firefox, and you "saved" the password when logging into the maintenance site, 192.168.1.1, then you can simply go to the Firefox tab at the top in the browser window, choose options, go to Security tab, then choose Saved Passwords, then locate the http://192.168.1.1, and then choose Show Passwords. Hit yes if prompted, and voila. You can see all the passwords. Then take that password and type it in when you load up the Windows 7.
I just sent my roommate an email asking for the password, but I'm not sure if he will write back. Probably the password contains something he doesn't want people to know. 
I tried to export the connection profile to an XML file from command line with instructions I found somewhere on the web, and then imported it from my Windows 7 installation, but then it asked me for the password again.
I just installed Windows 7 in a new partition, and have Windows Vista installed in the old partition. We have a router at home that belongs to my roommate, who is on a trip and won't come back until February. For some reason, he didn't want to give me the password but instead, just came and typed it in my computer when I was using my Windows Vista installation, so I can connect through that installation since the password is saved.
So my question is, considering that this router is here at home, and that my Windows Vista knows the router's password, is there any way I can connect to the internet through my Windows 7 installation?
