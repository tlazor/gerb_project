You can tweak mysql and apache to use work with much less ram than their defaults, this is a different subject though and obviously it may not be an option (based) on the volume of your traffic etc... 
I'd be interested to see what can be learned about reducing its memory footprint. I will start research this myself. ( I'm running well over 10 coins on a server I host and just had to bump its ram to 4g as it was swapping all over the place, so it would be good to know )
Its interesting that its connected to so many nodes, on default it only does about 8 connections last time I looked
For mysqld checkout mysqltuner.pl and start bumping numbers (plenty of tutorials out there for this but I suggest small changes at a time)
I think bitcoind will always need a big chunk amount or ram though... (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2485)... 
..this is from a reasonably small mysqld I run on one of my VMs (debian 6), its around 128Mb in footprint right now (but could potentially go up to 164Mb).. 
(use more if you want to sync the entire blockchain (from scratch) faster, then reduce it afterwards although I'm uncertain how/if this will effect its footprint.)
Swapfiles may not be option depending on the virtualization used but its better than things crashing I assume.
