So I need a way to use that second (media room) router to provide the DNS for whatever is connected to it, while at the same time sharing the same internet connection (from the ISP router) and also having all my devices to continue to "see" each other (for DLNA, file transfers etc) regardless to what router they are connected to!
Based on the link you posted, they are giving instructions to route 8.8.8.8 to nowhere which apparently forces the Roku to use whatever DHCP servers are in the DHCP scope.   Based on what your ISP will allow you to do, here are your options.
I recently ordered an HDMI Roku Stick because it has certain features that Apple TV doesn't. The problem: You can't change the DNS settings on the Roku, you have to do it at router level, and my ISP will not give me the password to my main router, so I can't change the DNS there. 
The Roku will be connected to the media room router, but changing the DNS on that router didn't seem to have any effect, probably because it is functioning as a switch (DHCP Server is disabled). 
My home network consists of a DSL modem/router provided by my ISP and a second TP-Link router (currently functioning as a switch / Wi-Fi access point)  in another room (media room). I am using an Apple TV, which allows me to change its DNS settings so I can watch USA Netflix from abroad.
