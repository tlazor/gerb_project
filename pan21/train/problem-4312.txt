...but that doesn't really solve the problem, and will affect all environments they connect to, including their local instance(s).
(Go ahead, try it - even a query that is somehow artificially limited to return 100 rows can bring your system to its knees.)
No, there is no policy for this. You could perhaps figure out a way, e.g. via Group Policy somehow, to set this value to 100...
Is there a policy or special configuration to make SQL Server show limited results (i.e. 100 rows) on huge tables? If so, which SQL Server version does that?
You can prevent SELECT * by adding this computed column to the table (or to a view that references the table):
But again, that doesn't prevent them from selecting all rows. I have to agree with Thomas here - why are these developers allowed to run whatever ad hoc queries they feel like against critical systems? Do you really want them to even be able to do this:
The issue is that many developers are executing such SELECT statements on huge tables, which slows down SQL Server performance.
What you could do is deny them direct access to the tables, and force their access through stored procedures - which take parameters for row counts etc., and the code could cap how high those could go (either by checking or using a parameter of type TINYINT).
