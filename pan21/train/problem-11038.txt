When I only had one interface ens2, I can access the server using ens2's IP address. When I added the second interface ens3, I can't access the server using the IP on ens2, but accessing it using ens3's IP works.
Recently, I added a second NIC to my Debian server. Another NIC is being shipped, bringing the total to 3 WAN connections.
Assume the NICs are named ens2, ens3, and ens4. "Accessing" means any network connections to the server (SSH, VNC, ping, etc.)
What you want is for the packets to go back out the same interface. This will set up a second routing table for the second interface:
How do I access the server from all WAN interfaces? I tried to mess with the routing table, but my lack of knowledge in routing simply made the machine inaccessible from the network/s.
Regardless of which interface a connection comes in on, the routing table determines how the response is sent.  If, for example, you have ens2 as 10.1.2.3/24 and ens3 as 10.1.9.3/24, and a server running.  A packet comes in from 172.12.2.2 for 10.1.9.3.  The server replies and the default gateway device is ens2 so the response goes back to 172.12.2.2 from 10.1.2.3, and nothing works.
