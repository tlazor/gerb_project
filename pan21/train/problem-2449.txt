I've been using InControl5 for 10+ years to take snapshots of Windows folders and registry while testing software installation packages.  It takes a snapshot of the system before running the install program and then takes another snapshot when the install is complete.  It compares the two snapshots and generates a report which shows files, folders and registry values created, modified or deleted.
It seems to me there might be a newer/better tool out there by now.  Does anyone use anything else for this kind of purpose?
An alternate programs is ZSoft Uninstaller. I’ve tried a lot of these kinds of programs and ZSoft’s was the next best one to InCtrl; it works pretty well, is fairly effective at catching changes to both the file-system and registry without cluttering with too many false-positives, and unlike most programs in the category is actually free.
There's Sandboxie combined with an additional utility called SandboxDiff that might be able to do what you need. The author of SandboxDiff mentioned he had also previously used InControl5.
Well PC Magazine has updated InCtrl5 itself, but since they started charging for utilities several years ago, InCtrlX is not free.
You might have a look at Total Uninstall. I've been using it for years and it's a very efficient uninstaller that compares snapshots before and after installation. Very reliable and highly configurable.
