(on a side note, hopefully you installed SP3 prior to starting updates, as that eliminated 100 or so)
Windows may suck due to the updates, but at the same time, I'm glad Microsoft does them in a (usually) timely manner.  Not all software vendors do this and for the core workstation OS at many companies I consider it a good thing.
I know that doesn't answer your question, but I think MS in this case takes the lead in software updates.  Also if they re-wrote thier OS from the ground up it would be way more secure, since they could throw out all the old legacy code that users demand stays so they can still use those old Windows 95 program they refuse to upgrade.
If the complaint is that more secure OS's require fewer updates - I'm afraid they're falling into a 'security through obscurity' argument.  I'd probably steer the discussion toward a consideration of all the changes/costs required if they DID want to switch desktop OS.
I'm not sure comparing # of updates is any kind of useful metric regarding the value of an operating system.  
That can be a tough one because if nothing is wrong with the computer, then many users typically say why both with updates.  Since this is a company they don't get that choice.  It would be a lot like if a company firewall gets put in that blocks IM, facebook, etc after its been open for years.  Sorry company policy has changed so this is the way it is now.
The true issue at hand is that those machines have been growing more and more vulnerable as time goes on, and the update time is trivial compared to the lost time/data for the alternative.  This would have been true of ANY unpatched OS.
Only thing I could recommend is to set the computers to check daily at like 3am and tell people to leave them on at night for the next while.
