Just an FYI to save other hassle: It's my understanding that unless you want to install a BIOS chip you're stuck with the chrome OS kernel, and can only replace the userspace with Ubuntu. Depending on what you need/want this may be enough, or it may not be. But if you're expecting to just make a normal Ubuntu install, don't. Chrome OS netbooks apparently can't even boot from USB keys.
If you read down the comments someone has stated that the same script works for the Samsung Series 5.  You just have to find out where the devel switch is.  I believe its actually easier to locate than that of the cr48.  
It may be that my SSD was a previous generation; essentially if you can hold on for anecdotal evidence of Ubuntu's performance on this particular Chromebook, you could potentially save yourself some bother.
I say this having had an Acer Aspire One laptop. The SSD that it was provided with was very slow when using Ubuntu or Windows XP, but on installing Chromium OS, there was a marked speed boost as disk writes were significantly decreased.
I would recommend checking the SSD, whether it is SLC or MLC. If it is the former, Ubuntu will probably wear the SSD drive out more quickly than Chrome OS would.
Ubuntu does work on Atom platforms. They had at one time released a Netbook version which was tailored for Atom chips, but they have since rolled that into the 11.04 release.
