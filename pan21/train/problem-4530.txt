The root DNS zones are now signed, and I am increasingly seeing my mail server reporting that the DNS data was signed.  The signing of DNS has been reported as a requirement for IPV6.  Signed DNS makes cache poisoning very difficult, but adds to the difficulty of managing DNS.
If you run a caching name server it will copy the root server list, and very soon have the roots for .com, .net, etc.  There is a very good reason that DNS is distributed.  Otherwise everyone would be working with obsolete data.  The size of the database would be quite large, and the majority of the data of no interest to you.
There are options to decrease the risk of DNS poisoning and good software deals with the problems as they become known.  There are organization which work at providing sanitized data which can be used as upstream providers. These will filter out some poisoning attempts.  Look at using OpenDNS or google as upstream providers.  
For closely related servers there are zone transfers.  These function much like BGP announcements.  For security reasons, these are usually blocked for other servers.
