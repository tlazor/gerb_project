Are you sure that the server was actually restarted? Maybe it the shutdown process hanged for some reason. Have you looked at the event log and seen the startup events?
Not sure how that answers your RDP question - but as far as RDP goes you should check the server log. Either Terminal Services (RDP) server is down, there could be a firewall issue, or there could be a licensing issue that would cause that error.
may be you are not connecting to remote session through administrator account. if it is so , please add your accout to remote session option in my computer/property
Does anybody knows How to bound TCP to only one NIC ? could you please give me the path or command? Is there any command line I could use to do it?
We restarted our Windows 2003 server R2 last night (09/27) and since that day we can not connect through RDP. 
I'm not sure if I understand your question, but to only use TCP/IP on one NIC you would uncheck "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" in the network settings for any other NIC other than the one you want to have connected.
