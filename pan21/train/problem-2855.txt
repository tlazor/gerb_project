The source should contain the python static library which, as I understand it, is what the python-dev package is. Make sure that the "include" directory is set up in your compiler options.
The packages have been designed to play nice with the other packages and with the general behavior of the distro. Any compatibility issues with self-compiled software is your problem.
Pre-Configurated Package: This package is intended for most users. It is designed to work well with most packages, and does not require any extra libraries for compiling.
Compiled from Source: This package is meant for systems with very customized options. Most importantly, either a custom kernel or custom x-servers/system commands. It is for the more experienced user, but is much more likely to fit any setup, as it is compiled to your system's specs.
In my experience it's best to use apt-get first. If problems arise (relatively unlikely, depends on how much you like tinkering with your system) start looking at compiling from  source.
If the compiled software does not work, you will need to ask for help from the developers. However, they will not normally fix non-standard compilations.
