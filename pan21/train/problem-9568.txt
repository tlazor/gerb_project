The only filesystems that really need defragmenting under normal circumstances are FAT16/FAT32. ext2/3, NTFS, and most modern filesystems usually only see serious fragmentation (to the point where the performance hit is measurable) after years of active use or when they get close to full.
Cleaning up the Prefetch folder on Windows XP. Several articles on the Web, including this one, have proven it does not work at all.
Defragmenting filesystems regularly. I know people who spend more time watching the progress of the NTFS defragmenter than they do anything else.
A perfect example of this would be the advice to run Nightly anti-virus scans of all files.  While I think that scanning all the files periodically is useful (I do it once a week). I also feel that doing a virus scan too frequently on "all files" is detrimental.
Virus scanners check all the files which are accessed.  So once you have scanned the entire contents of your hard disk once, theoretically under these conditions, you should never touch another file on your system without the AV software also inspecting it first.  So during this "static" state it is unnecessary to keep scanning everything. The system must touch/open/access/copy a file for a virus to end up on your disk.  So that being said...
Especially when people keep forcing it to re-run to try coalesce the free-space, when doing so just means files immediately gain a fragment as soon as they next extend.
