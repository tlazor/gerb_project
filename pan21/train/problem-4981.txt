I've not used NME yet but my first test with HaXe+Molehill (just a few days ago) produced 60fps when rendering 10,000 16x16 rotating sprites on my laptop.  I've only been using HaXe for a few days and don't have enough experience with it to be sure it's the right thing for you, but it's worth a look.
SDL 1.3 is also shaping up quite well. Sam seems to be done making the major API changes, and what is already in is pretty stable already. Still ... it's not even beta yet, and Allegro 5.0 is released.
I'm personally a huge fan of Allegro 5, but it is a C API. Still and all, it's a simple API that get's out of your way and provides access to:
I've been using LÃ–VE for some time now and I like it a lot. You would have to learn Lua, but it is a fun little language to learn anyway. The people at the forum are extremely helpful.
Since you said you like Actionscript but are looking for cross platform, take a look at HaXe + NME.  HaXe is a language similar to Actionscript, but can compile to Flash, Javascript, PHP, or C++. NME is a library similar to Flash's graphics library, but runs on other platforms too. This combination allows you to compile to many different platforms.
Granted, for more complex and advanced games you'd probably want to pair Allegro 5 with some sort of physics library (Box2D, for example). Still, you can get a very long way, and have a pile of fun, with nothing more than what Allegro 5, the C or C++ standard library, and your own code.
It's a tried and true OpenGL (ES) platform which has sound, physics, and even a little 3D that has been out for the iPhone for a while now, and is just coming to other platforms.
