From the Web config tool, I am able to configure a port to function in Trunk mode, but I don't see a way to then set the VLANS that I want that port to participate within.  When I set the port to Port VLAN Mode of Trunk, the PVID is set to 1 and I don't see a way to change the PVID or to add multiple values to it as I would expect.
I need to configure a port on a PowerConnect 5424 to function as a Trunk port.  That port will be connected to a Cisco router that will deliver traffic for 2 seperate VLANS - I need the switch to deliver the traffic to the proper VLAN.
Recall that the PVID, or Priority VLAN ID, is the vlan that the switch will assign untagged packets to should that port ever see such packets.  So you want to ensure that this is not set to the VLANs you are expecting to tag through the port.
You should be able to go back to the port VLAN membership screen and select VLANs for that port.  You do it on a port-by-port basis, not VLAN-by-VLAN basis, which is kinda backwards for trunk ports.
I can't tell you how to do it on the web interface as i turn them off as a matter of course when configuring a switch, but here is the commands to do it on the CLI (it's from  a trunk config between a 5424 and a cisco switch):
yes yes, i know using VLAN1 is a no no ... but honestly the dells are such a PITA that getting them to work - well getting them to work at all - with somethings besides vlan 1 just wasn't worth the effort. It'll be changed as soon as I pull the last of them off my network.
