They might claim there is nothing wrong, but if the issue is repeatable, you're in luck - you can demand live support during an occurrence.
The three environments are running the same code and the same data schema. There is no corresponding increase in network activity, CPU utilisation, disk read/write activity. None of us has the faintest idea what's caused this sudden increase, or what we can do to troubleshoot it. A few people have said "oh, that's just cloud computing for you" but I can't quite accept that hosting at AWS just means sometimes your entire website will slow down by 1 second per request, for no reason, and you just shrug and ignore it.
