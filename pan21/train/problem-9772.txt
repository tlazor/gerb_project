And finally, yes, by joining the domain, you are giving your IT staff godlike rights on your computer. That's the very nature of an Active Directory domain environment, it's actually part of the whole point of AD. (The other being that it's a good meeting point between security and convenience, unified credential structure and management and all that.)
Yes, you can (and it sounds like you should) reload your computer from scratch. You don't need to use their image to be a domain-joined machine. Make sure before you blow it away, though, that you have all your ducks lined up regarding licensing. (See if you have a sticker on the machine, open license, whatever. Though they don't sound like your favorite people right now, the IT department will probably have a pretty good idea how your machine is licensed.)
You will need to have your domain credentials (if your machine is currently a domain machine, then that's probably the user creds you use to log in every day.) Here's the hiccup: your account must be a a member of a group which has "Join the Domain" rights in Group Policy. As I am not one of your domain admins, I can't speak to whether this is the case--if not, then you will need to drag your computer to them and get them to punch in some admin creds when you domain-join.
