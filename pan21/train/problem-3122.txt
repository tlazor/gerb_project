I have 268 PDFs to go through and need to extract the 1st, 4th and 8th page of. so instead of having a pdf file of multiple pages, I need to somehow make them into files with the desire pages only. I'm hoping that there is a more efficient way than doing it manually and save some time by have a batch process to extract just the desire pages from the 268 pdfs and place it in a new pdf. Does anyone know any other programs or methods that this could be achieved?
Since you're on Windows, you could use PowerShell and PDFTk to achieve your goal with a single click
Not sure if this is a option you would consider... If you have a adobe version that lets you make make pdfs then you can print those pages you require to the adobe virtual printer and make a new pdf of the pages you require.
I'm using version adobe acrobat professional v10. Just thought of another option... you can use any 3rd party pdf creator that should be available for free download to achieve the same thing.
I know that there is a form for extracting the first page and it involves some code writing but I'm not familiar with and I don't know how to code it that it will give me the 1st, 4th and 8th page only.
