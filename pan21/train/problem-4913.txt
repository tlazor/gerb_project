Ick, I really hate it when this happens (especially printers directly mapped by IP as there's no sensible way of telling where the print came from). I feel your pain, I've been in this situation before and it's not fun.
Have you tried a brand new IP address for a printer which is printing garbage? It could be that you update the driver on 20 computers, but one you've forgotten about one that has a (buggy|old|corrupted) driver which is causing the printer to print garbage. This is probably a last resort, but we had to do this once with great success - the printer is still going strong today and hasn't printed garbage since we gave it a new IP address.
For smaller shops it pays to check/change network ports or even whole switches. And have  a careful think about how your switches are daisy chained together.
It's also possible that the printer is faulty. There's not much you can do about this if it's out of warranty. You need to look at how much trouble it's actually causing and replace if necessary.
There's always the good old "check for driver updates". I know what HP are like (or aren't, as it seems) at updating their printer drivers, but it's something to check every now and then regardless. While you're looking at drivers, look for model specific drivers, but also try the HP Universal Print Driver - I've had success with the universal driver where a model specific one wasn't available.
I'm being quite general with my points below, as this is a very common issue, and is relevant to most printers regardless of manufacturer.
Bad connections (network cable, USB cables, $whatever cables) can corrupt whatever is going down the cable and cause the printer to print garbage. Try replacing the $whatever cable with another to see if this helps.
