In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 most targeted daemons do not interact with user data and are not affected by NFS-mounted home directories. One exception is Apache HTTP. For example, CGI scripts that are on the mounted file system have the nfs_t type, which is not a type httpd_t is allowed to execute. 
In addition to Matt's suggestion, also check that Apache is permitted to serve files from where your NFS mount point exists. For security purposes a lot Apache distributions come with a restrictive directive like so:
I'm unfamiliar with how RHEL5 distributes it's Apache config files. But you may need to create an additional Directory directive to permit files being served from your mount point.
This prevents any files being served from / and above. Typically you will then have a less restrictive rule to allow another directory, which contains your DocumentRoots, to serve up files a little more freely.
It's most likely a permission issue. If apache isn't writing to the directory, it doesn't care if the files it's reading are on NFS or anything else. 
Assuming that your webserver is running as user "apache", make sure that the permissions on the file are such that they're world-readable. 
somebody mentionned changing the group of the dir to www-data, but i just chmodded it back to 777 after the mount. I need to read up on nfs mounts to do that automatically
