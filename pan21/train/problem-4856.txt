Another thing to mention, Math.min code you have isn't helping you out very much. You are essentially restricting the whole point of the deltaTime value. If it takes libGDX less than 1/60 of a second to render a frame, that will be reflected in the delta value. For example: If you have two ticks that take 1/120 of a second (this is an extreme and will never happen), by setting your deltaTime to 1/60, you are making libGDX think that 2/60 seconds went by, when really 2/120 seconds went by. So you really shouldn't be restricting your deltaTime value.
If you have 1 update in 1 second, delta will be 1f, and you character will move by 1. If you have 60 updates in 1 second, delta will be 1/60f, and in 1 second your character will move 60 * (1/60f) which is still 1.
The error you show in the 2nd image is perfectly understandable, but I really think that it is so minimal you don't need to worry. You're talking about 1 100th of error. 
The deltaTime is the time it takes for the system to render one frame, thus if you are using deltaTime correctly, your character should move the same amount regardless of the frame rate. For example, if you are moving your character by the raw deltaTime value (+= delta):
