Also, note that I'm using Clink as well, which provides a GNU readline-like line editing capability which I am thoroughly enjoying.  Clink is available like this:
I'm developer who was "born and bred" on Linux and BSD systems, and I've become accustomed to having advanced tools for the console (posix shells like bash, for example).  My career has taken a twist that means I'm working in a Windows environment most of the time, and the console capabilities are really poor by comparison.  The traditional windows console environment is a complete joke, and even most of the third party attempts at improving things aren't a lot better.  PowerShell is a huge step in the right direction, but the console applications themselves are still way behind where unix has been for 20 years.

I like how you call cmd.exe a joke and it being over 20 years behind linux - I feel the same way and actually think about moving to Linux for great console and scripting experience plus all my favourite IDEs and tools are there already (WebStorm, PyCharm, Vim, python, nodejs, Firefox, etc.) the only things I'll miss are Total Commander and AutoHotKey.
Does anyone know of a PowerShell console application that supports advanced command line editing like posix shells do?  I'm particularly interested in emacs-mode editing, and I'd also like to be able to resize my window to an arbirary size, unlike the native console app that comes with Windows.

After all this time, I have finally found a solution I like: ConEmu + Clink.  And not just ConEmu, but Ethan Brown's ConEmu config:
