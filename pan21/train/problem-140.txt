I've been bitten by weird failures of both Cisco's and Dell's stacking technologies that I will not depend on them to provide redundancy.
Stacking configuration for the upstairs and downstairs pairs of 8024's gives you a huge advantage in ISL link bandwidth without having to sacrifice any of the 24 ports available on each switch for a LAG connection.
As per the diagram below we have 2x 8024's upstairs and 2x downstairs providing links over MMF fiber for redundancy. Data being transferred is a mixture (70/30) of iSCSI/LAN on separate VLANs.
If redundancy is a big concern and you have the links to spare, I would agree with longneck on suggesting the LAG connections.
The craziest example would be a stack of 3 Cisco 3750's where two switches appeared to have failed. After a protracted support call with Cisco, we figured out that the problem was the third, seemingly functional, switch. If I removed the third switch from the stack, the other two switches came back to life. And no, the third switch was not the master. But simply having it connected in the stack ring caused the other switches to stop working.
How can we best configure these switches to allow for redundancy and throughput, 2x stacks of 2 8024's or 1x stack of 4 switches and where should LAG be employed?
The problems mentioned by longneck are definitely one-off scenarios, and are not something you're likely to run into with these newer switches (especially if you stay somewhat up-to-date on firmware). In comparison to a LAG link though, a stacking link probably isn't going to provide the same fault tolerance (single connection vs multiple links).
We are constructing a new networking infrastructure to replace out 1GbE backbone and have decided upon using 4x Dell PowerConnect 8024F's as our "core" switches.
