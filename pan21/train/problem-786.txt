This searches the domain or Organisational Unit specified for machines which have not logged in for the last x days, and provides you with reporting or the facility to disable those computer accounts. 
Similar approaches are available involving reports in SCCM to investigate the time when a machine was last able to give a heartbeat; provided the machines have functioning SCCM clients, this would arguably be a better approach than pulling a report and attempting to ping them - a technique which would be incredibly labour intensive and prone to false positive results.
The tool and representation in Active Directory is only representing what the domain knows about, so you still need to build a reporting process external to the Active Directory environment to enable you to track the machines which report as having not been used to verify they have actually left the organisation and should be removed. A prime example here is indeed laptops: the tools may report a laptop as being out-of-use when really this is hiding the fact the laptop is simply in-use offline.
