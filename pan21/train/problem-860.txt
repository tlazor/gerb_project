The concept is loosely based on Social Bookmarking. However here there is a very private component which you may appreciate (I certainly do).
Another way might be to export or import bookmark from one to another one. Not sure if this can be done by script?
If you move the focus of your bookmarks to the web, you can share them across any web browser. Free services like BookmarkSync allow you to do this. With the advantage that bookmarks stay in your browsers.
One option is to drop bookmarks altogether and use Delicious tagging instead. I find tagging much more intuitive and useful than bookmarks stored in a purely hierarchical structure.
I have a Mac with both Safari and Firefox as my primary browsers. I like to use both. Is there any way to share my Firefox bookmarks with my Safari? I guess one way is to change my browser configuration settings to let both to point to the same bookmark file. However, I am not sure if the bookmark for Safari will be compatible with the one of Firefox?
There are addons for both Firefox and Safari that will make your interaction with Delicious more streamlined.
