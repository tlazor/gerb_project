For example When user searched near my site return other words that are near that, like near,pear,dear,rear,here
Once you've got phonetic equivalences, you can use a variety of heuristics to minimise the difference between them. For poetry, you probably need to excessively emphasise the weight of terminations - rhyming mostly depends on word endings. You may want alliterative runs for poetry, too - a different weighting would probably be needed for euphonious alliteration. 
I am going to create a dictionary that users can find each words that are near each other from pronouncing and word Letter.
I think this is tolerably complex. It's a branch of Natural Language Programming (not the other NLP, Neuro Linguistic Pap). You need to be able to match "here" and "hear" - so you need to break down the elements, and map them to a phonetic equivalence (h-"ere" and h-"ere" for both). And some spellings have variant phonetics (cough, plough, through) or have even worse homonyms (the there, they're, their group) and those can be regionally different (in the UK, the long or short 'a' in garage, graph and glass, for example). When you're making phonetic equivalences, they aren't always singular. 
I'd join one of the free online university courses on NLP - there are several, currently. Much better grounding in modern techniques for parsing language. :)
