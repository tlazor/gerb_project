You can use conditionals in your spec file to set certain dependencies based on the value of the %dist tag. This is generally done to handle dependency differences between major releases, but you could adapt it to point release.
You would then need to ensure your build environment provided the correct dist tag value to the build process. There's a number of ways this can be done and we would need to know more about your build environment.
The developer provided the source with the spec file. Is it possible to build a RPM that works across all CentOS 7.x builds and is that a good idea?
Unless the package depends another library update or something that was introduced in a point release, a single build for all of CentOS 7 will suffice.
You can see examples of this in the updates repositories. Many packages will use a %dist tag that is el7, but you can also see some that are tagged el7_4.
All Centos 7.x are juste minor upgrades, so I don't think you need to make the difference in your rpms. All centos packages are suffixed with el7, not with el7.6 or similar so I think you can do that safely (we are doing it for at least two years already).
