Output from 'whoami /groups' yields nothing out of the ordinary which is not suprising since locally everything works anyway.
Obviously I'm trying to do this as a logged on domain admin - the same things (using the same admin user) works fine with any other machine.
Default SMB shares (i.e. \machine\c$) yield a password dialog, upon entering my credentials the dialog comes up again (normal behaviour for "Access Denied"). The security log shows successful authentification though.
It sounds like a rouge user (with local admin rights) removed the domain admins group from the local Administrators group. There are a few registry hacks that can also achieve the same results you describe. Is the primary user of this workstation a "Power User"? Do they have local admin rights? Do they seem like the type of user who would hack their own workstation?
When trying to (remote-) access a specific Win 7 workstation (which shouldn't really be any different from the others) most remote adminstration tasks yield 'Access Denied' for example when trying to use the MMC to open the scheduled tasks, services (this one requires some special registry key which I distribute through a GPO), events or using the explorer to browse default SMB shares (dollar shares) etc.
