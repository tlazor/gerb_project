This is a very common need, and I'm surprised there are not more solutions to it.  It is extremely common to script a session, then somebody has a need to review the procedure.  You want to cut out all the little typing mistakes, and color escape sequences to create a "clean" script of the procedure for future reference.  Simple ASCII text preferred.
col -bp processes the backspaces as desired (AFAIK).  But it mangles the color escape sequences.  It might be good to remove the color sequences first, then process the backspaces, if possible.
For example the screen might be blank except for Andrew $, if you then typed rm /* and pressed backspace twelve times (far more than needed), what gets shown on the screen at the end of that depends on what shell was running, what your current stty settings are (which you might change partway through a session) and probably some other factors too.
I'm using the linux 'script' command  http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/script1.html to track some interactive sessions. The output files from that contain unprintable characters, including my backspace keystrokes.
It's been 4 years since I last updated/used it, but I don't remember doing anything fancy that shouldn't still work today.
For a large quantity of script output, I'd hack a perl script together iteratively. Otherwise hand edit with a good editor.
The above applies to any automated method of continuously capturing input and output. The main alternative is  taking "screen shots" or cutting and pasting the screen at appropriate times during the session (which is what I do for user guides, notes for a day-log, etc).
There is unlikely to be an existing automated method of removing control characters from script output in a way that reproduces what was displayed on the screen at certain important moments (such as when the host was waiting for that first character of some user input).
