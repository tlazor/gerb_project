The performance for the exchange server is great however I am having trouble reaching the webrick server from outside the instance. The virtual machine is connected to the network in bridged mode and is assigned an IP which I can ping and access IIS 7 websites from. The virtual machine also has windows server 2008 R2 installed on it. 
I am starting the Webrick server on port 3000 and I am even binding it to the static IP given to the instance however I believe that IIS or some other process is intercepting all http requests to the instance. With apache I could make a VirtualHost and handle it that way, is there anything similar for IIS? Or is the problem something completely different. Do I need to get rails working with IIS 7 via fcgi? i rather avoid this. 
Since I am not using IIS for hosting websites can I just remove it? (I am not very experienced with windows server)
I am setting up a separate external server (as a virtual machine) and decided to run Microsoft Outlook 2010 server on it as well as Webrick (temporary, will move to more robust server for production).
