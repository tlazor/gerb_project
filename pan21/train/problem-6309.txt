I was running into this issue while using a home OpenVPN server and connecting to it using the Tunnelblick application on Mac.
What was happening on my end is that a route with my home IP as the destination and an incorrect gateway was getting leftover after disconnecting from the VPN. Deleting this route solved the issue, simply
I can't under any circumstances connect to my home network (VPN, ping, anything) after this happens. If I then just delete the route:
Example: I am at school and after a fresh computer boot, I connect to a wireless network. I connect to my home OpenVPN server with Tunnelblick. 
There might be an issue with how the OpenVPN server/client is configured which is leaving this (and I'd be interested in finding out what that is), but I installed a Tunnelblick post-disconnect script that automates this route deletion.
First you need a route for your network interface. If the VPN is disconnected then just take your network interface down and then bring it back up with ifconfig. Then use the route commnand to build in your default gw. So something like: 
You need to flush the routes . Use route -n flush several times . Afterwards add your routes with route add.
