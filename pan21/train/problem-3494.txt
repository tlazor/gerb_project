If there is any automated solution then great, otherwise if I have to write some tool by myself, I am still open to the idea.
With great efforts finally I was able to setup Mysql replication (both on windows) from one host to other as simple one way asynchrounous master-slave replication. Now purpose of this replication is just to have upto date backup, and we can switch to slave server at the time of crash.
For Monitoring the Slave lag, i use mk-heartbeat. Its output is processed by a simple nagios plugin. So the alerting stuff is handled by nagios via SMS, Mail, ...
It works really well to monitor mysql slave sql_io_running, sql_thread_running and seconds_behind_master
There's also nagios plugin mysql_slavestatus available here https://www.claudiokuenzler.com/monitoring-plugins/check_mysql_slavestatus.php#.WRKpt8akLIV
I made a scheduled program that queries "SHOW SLAVE STATUS" and I notify myself in case of any error.
I also have another small script, which daily counts the number of rows in every table and then calculates the chunk-size and stores it in the table given at --arg-table ... so things should be kind of automagic ...
To make sure the data is the same on all replication nodes, i use mk-table-checksum. I have a small script which runs mk-table-checksum every day and checksums 1/7 of all my data on master and slaves and then verifies the checksums. So in every week, the whole data should have been checksummed. I'm currently working on a small wrapper arround this script to get the results back into nagios again. For mk-table-checksum i recommend to dig into the arguments --arg-table, --replicate, --modulo, --offset, ...
