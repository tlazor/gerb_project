I'm a bit of a storage geek and have used HDS boxes and their HP XP equivilants, HP EVA extensively, HP MSAs quite a lot (love their new'ish 2000fc G2 model btw), a few NetApps and the odd EMC box. Also worked a bit with Openfiler and LeftHand too.
Only drawback (apart from the price) which we encountered is snapshots not being replicated from one unit to another. Other than that, we are extremely satisfied with performance, reliability and usability.
It all comes down to what you need to achieve and what support resources you have available. If you need as close to 100% availability or the best performance under load then I think it's hard to beat top-end FC boxes, of course these need some fairly specialist skills and don't come cheap. If you're after the best bang for the buck then some of these software/VM based solutions can't be beat, they're cheap and fast but not as reliable as others. For most a compromise is perfectly adequate and in that case you can't really go wrong with EVAs or NetApps (with MSAs useful if the space/power/cash budget is low). Most people with a sensible amount of experience will naturally lean towards one model or another, I'm no exception and like EVAs as they're plenty fast enough and very simple to manage indeed.
A drawback of using iSCSI if you're not aware of it, VMWare do not support MicroSoft Clustering Services on iSCSI/NFS storage under ESX/vSphere. This may change in the future. This was a bummer as we were looking at clustering our SQL Server's on to VMWare/Lefthand.
We have two Dell Equallogic PS6000. One is our master SAN replicating to another unit in a different part of the building.
Looked at FalconStor, Compellent, HP Eva, EMC and a bigger NetApp before going for the Lefthand, which did most of what the NetApp/EMC did but at half the price. We wanted something with good 'enterprise' grade 24x7 4 hour response support for when it hit the fan so this ruled most of the freebies/low cost solutions out.
Those are very nice pieces of hardware. You get dual power-supplies, dual-controllers (firmware upgrades without downtime!), each controller has 4 gigabit Ethernet connections, a webbased platform-independent management, SNMP, replication, stackability (up to twelve? units, doesn't need to be the same models), SATA, SAS or SSD drives (hot-swappable), different RAID-levels (including RAID6) ...
Our service-plan is 24x7x4 and the units have a phone-home feature (which can be turned off), which alerts Dell/Equallogic in case a drive is failing.
Why have you got iSCSI in the title, are you only interested in iSCSI solutions as SAN can encompass more than just that.
It can be something preconfigured from storage vendors (EMC CLARiiON, HP EVA, HP Modular Smart Array) or custom-built systems running OpenFiler, NexentaStor, OpenSolaris Storage, StarWind Server, etc.
Especially the integration with Citrix XenServer (Volume creation, snapshots, Thin-Provisioning, Desaster-Recovery) caught our interest.
