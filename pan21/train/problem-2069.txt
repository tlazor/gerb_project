I came across a lot of the diagnostic information above while trying to get SSL working, but Im not sure what to make of the information and now I am stuck.
The website is working fine over normal HTTP so I won't post the configuration for that (I can if you wish to see it!)
My apache version is: 2.2.14 (running on Ubuntu). The information below seems to show that SSL is configured and running fine, but when I try to access https://website.com the request times out.
The most likely problem is either with your iptables configuration or an external firewall run by your hosting provider.
Ok, so I'm trying to configure my server to accept SSL connections and I cannot get it working. I'm aware there are a lot of similar questions on the site, but each one I have come across so far doesn't seem to help. 
If GoDaddy is also your hoster, I would suggest taking it up with them, as it seems to be a problem on their side.
In particular the Allow from line. So basically it is only allowing connections from localhost. So connecting to localhost:443 will work fine, but connecting by the external facing IP address won't work.
When using localhost, everything appears to be normal (can't say I know what normal is, but there is a lot of relevant information output and doesn't appear to be any errors).
