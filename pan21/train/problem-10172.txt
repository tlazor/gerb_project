Protect the sheet, allowing selection of Unlocked Cells Only, should be under the format menu on the Home tab of the ribbon.
This is what I had to do for the different scanners that we were using for physical inventory at my company.
I've been asked by our warehouse guy to help him with an excel spreadsheet to increase his productivity. The problem is, I'm not what you would call an "excel expert". What he wants sounds very simple, I'm just not sure how to do it ...so here goes.
The solution for me was to set the global suffix "tab". Excel recognize 2 scans (or even more scans one after another) as one input and if you press enter Excel will jump one row down and to the left side, where you have started scanning one row above. That means: A1 scan (suffix=Tab) -> B1 scan (suffix=Tab) -> C1 Enter (pressing on keyboard manually) -> A2
instructions on how to do this.  Typically it involves scanning a single or sequence of barcodes that programs this function into the scanner.  
But I had a similar issue today and we are using a Datalogic Quickscan L QD 2300. We want to scan and an automatic jump to the right cell in Excel.
Right now he has a usb barcode scanner. When he scans to an excel spreadsheet the default action after a scan is that it moves down one cell. So, if it's in cell A1, it moves down to B1. What he needs it to do is move in this sequence when he scans: A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2,D1,D2 etc all the way down the page. The reason for this is he needs the part and lot number right next to each other. If someone could help me with this I would be eternally grateful. Thanks!
