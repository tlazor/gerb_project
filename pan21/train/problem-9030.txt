I just found a friend running windows 7. Its /boot/efi/Microsoft partition is 17.2MiB. Refind occupies another 7.1 MiB, making the total well under 32 MiB. It is unlikely Windows 8 or 10 uses much more than that, but it would be nice to know anyway. A 64MiB partition should be plenty.
I'm installing Linux on a new computer with a blank hard drive. I would like the option of installing Windows on it later if I need to, and I would like to know now while I am formatting the partition table how big I need to make the ESP in case I do decide to drink that kool-aid. I know there are recommendations to allocate ~200MiB of space, but I can safely assume that there is a massive safety margin I know I won't need. I do only have a small SSD so it's not like I'm made of gigabytes here.
My own purposes notwithstanding, this would be a good thing to know in general and I'm sure there are others who require this information for all kinds of reasons.
As a pre-emptive stfu to all the people who say 200 megs isn't a lot, think of it as a 50% savings and you'll see why I care. The entire system is comprised of little pieces of 200MiB or less, and a 50% reduction in each of these components across the board is huge.
