Yes, you can use the AWS console to modify anything that was created by CloudFormation. You can also use different CloudFormation templates to launch various AWS resources. Here's how: enter link description here
For example, I created a LAMP stack with multiple EC2 instances using Cloud Formation. Now, I just want to assign a temporary Security Group to one of the instances for next day or two. Can I do this via AWS Console? Will this cause any issues with future Cloud Formation update?
You can use the AWS Management Console to update pretty much any aspect of an AWS CloudFormation stack, see Updating a Stack. While the most common approach is to have things that are anticipated to change modeled as input parameters, it is also possible to modify the stack template itself in principle:
Each property of every AWS Resource Type specifically states whether or not a resource can be changed and whether an update requires No Interruption, Some Interruption or a Replacement (see section Updates to stack resources in AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates for details).
