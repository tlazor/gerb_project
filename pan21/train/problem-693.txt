Then, just look at the last number of the company- name to determine if machine is odd or even, and group them by month that way.
Our server names all contain a number (e.g. site-service##) and then we group servers by even and odd.  Updates and patches are then applied to the even or odd group only.  We even use this system to balance power feeds and maintain network gear.
Well I guess a policy like 'even server serial numbers this month, odd next month' could work fine, it seems like a lot of work to me to maintain that list.  If you could query all your servers for their serial number over the network you could automate this process, which would make it manageable.
It's a relatively simple system that allows us to easily document changes like "Update XYZ applied to odd web-front ends today."
There are an almost infinite number of ways to do this and the suggestions here are going to be subjective. Here are my suggestions:
I guess I don't really understand this concept of 'monthly maintenance'.  What sorts of things do you need to batch up like this and do manually?  Are you talking about applying OS patches or firmware updates or what?  OS and software patches you should automate as much as possible and probably do on a fiarly continuous basis.  For firmware or bios updates I can see how you would want to group servers, since you have to reboot machines and that sort of thing is a fairly manual process no matter what.
Of course, this may not be helpful for you if your starting in an environment where servers are named after Disney characters or something else irrelevant.
How about this: just name all your machines with a prefix and start at 1.  Guesstimate how many servers you might ever have and pad with zeros.  Thus your first machine is company-00001, next is company-0002, etc.  You should probably assign functional names for regular use, for example use extra dns records to assign company-00001 web-00001.
