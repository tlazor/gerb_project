It works when exactly the same information, bssid and psk, is provided via the configuration file to wpa_supplicant instead of /etc/network/interfaces:
I suppose if your software has the smarts to look up the SSID associated with a given BSSID, and then use that SSID with he supplied passphrase to feed into PBKDF2 to create the PSK, then it could get on the network with just a BSSID and passphrase.
If you're using WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK with a passphrase, the passphrase is mixed with the SSID and run through a function called PBKDF2 to generate the actual PSK.
But using this configuration the system stays offline. I think the ssid is mandatory for wpa_supplicant but I don't understand why. Is there any technical reason? How to bypass this?
I do know the BSSID and passphrase of my wireless router and I want to connect my wireless interface to it without caring about the SSID. Thus, I do want it to work even after the SSID of the wireless router has been modified.
So unless you're passing the raw PSK (64 hexadecimal digits) to your software, it can't derive the PSK unless it knows the SSID.
