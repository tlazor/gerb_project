I also looked inside about:support to determine my profile directory and looked in every .cfg and .js files but still no lockPref that could explain why network.proxy.type is locked
When looking at C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\default/prefs/localsettings.js there are only 2 lines:
If you're in an enterprise Windows environment, it's possible that the setting has been enforced using a Group Policy Object rather than through config files.
If you want an approach to modifying the value that's GPO resistant, note that it's possible (in 60.6.1esr) to trick Firefox into not making use of the registry values by modifying the binary Mozilla Firefox/browser/omni.ja accordingly (just search for network.proxy.type). Note also that modifying it too much (e.g. changing its length) will just cause Firefox to crash when opened.
During my web search I found a lot of pages explaining how to lock some options etc but nothing on how to understand why an option is locked
If so, you should be able to dig up the the relevant setting from somewhere around HKLM\Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\Proxy in the Windows Registry.
