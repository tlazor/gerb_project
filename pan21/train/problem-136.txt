Any hotfix released between November 2014 and December 2015 and is Not included within the November 2014 / December 2014 Rollup Update MUST be installed manually AFTER April 2014 & November 2014 Rollup Updates (minimum) have been installed
Finally, you may need to update the CMOS.  This is essentially updating firmware.  But I want to make you aware of the need.  I lost hours by not updating these things BEFORE I installed Hyper-V.
April 2014 Rollup Update MUST be installed prior to any later Rollup Update being installed.  Note: April 2014 Update includes ALL prior Rollup Updates (for 2012 R2).
Will MS release later Rollup Updates for Windows 2012 R2?  Yes, MS will likely Roll all hotfixes between Nov 2014 and Jan / Feb 2016 into a later Rollup Update once Win 10 / 2016 has been released, etc.
Massimo's answer looked fine.  I want to emphasize one thing, change its order, and add one more thing.
Microsoft Rollup Updates are inclusive so the latest Rollup Update includes updates from the previous released update, however, there are prerequisite (requirements) for installing most hotfixes, rollup updates, service packs, etc.
I want to emphasize the importance of updating the BIOS.  For the hardware server supporting the VMs, the Hyper-V OS may need the latest BIOS.  This is probably the first thing that should be considered.  If you fail to do this, you may (or may not) need to reformat the hardware servers with the OS.  (This is the re-order and emphasis item combined.)

Each OS version's hotfix / update stream of course will have it's own prerequisite as updates may be unique to the version or may be a back-port from a later OS versions, etc. 
November 2014 Rollup Update includes ALL prior (back to May 2014) EXCEPT for April 2014.  April 2014 Update is Required to Install November 2014.
Microsoft Windows Update Service will ONLY push critical updates and hotfixes that have wide-spread issues.  Windows Update will NOT show, recommend or push hotfixes for unique or specific issues unless they are wide-spread so you MUST install any of these hotfixes manually.
You MUST install (at minimum) April 2014 & November 2014 prior to installing any later (~Nov 2014 thru 2016 Hotfixes).  Minimum Supported is 2012 R2 with April 2014 Rollup Update but November 2014 Update should also be installed (DO IT).
December 2014 is the Last (Current) Rollup Update to date (11/30/2015) as development teams were (are) focused on Windows 10 / 2016 releases.  December 2015 Update does include additional patches, however, after applying December 2014 Update, you may need to apply later versions of hotfixes that were included in the December 2014 Rollup Update package.
