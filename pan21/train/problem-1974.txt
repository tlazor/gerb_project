I ended up moving the patch panel to the top of the rack AND moving the box up the wall to about shoulder-height.
We finally found a use for the instruction manual that came with our telephone system, after removing the side of a comms cabinet, which caused it to turn from a rectangle to a parallelogram. The front could be encouraged in with a couple of strikes from an open hand, but the back had sharp edges, so we had to use the manual to give us something to hit against..
The most recent was:  I needed to replace 20 sections of CAT5 that were just installed, but were all faulty (I bought the cheap stuff - lesson learned).  The 'run' was from a small server closet, through the ceiling, through a cinder block wall, under some HVAC, across another ceiling, through 20' of conduit to a junction-box, and finally down another piece of conduit to another box where they would be terminated.
So, I carefully measured twice, then instructed our intern to go into the parking lot and cut off 20 100ft sections of CAT5...and NOT to screw up.  "Cut long, not short."
I call these 'work-arounds' and like to strut, shirtless, through the IT Dept each time I save the day with one of them.
One fun one i did last year was using login script and the bios editor from dell to enable wake on lan for all desktops when people log on. Then using the mac addresses (from another script) I would turn the machines on at weekends to allow wsus updates to download and install without affecting users. Then another script to shut them all down afterwards. Works like a charm.
We bundled them together and began dragging them from the server closet to their destination.  Once I arrived at the destination I realized that they were all too short....by about 10 feet after stretching.  There was no way to reach the box and no way I wanted to make that pain-in-the-butt run again.  I was hot, sweaty, and angry.  The intern had cut accurately, I had measured wrong...TWICE.
