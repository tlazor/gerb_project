Recommendations for learning resources are (unfortunately?) off topic on gamedev.stackexchange so I won't answer that part.
The fastest prototypes are created with pen and paper. For interactive prototypes some specialized applications exist, but I recommend instead of specialized applications you create interactive prototypes using the very GUI framework you're going to use to create your game. This is another reason to use an existing framework: when prototyping you don't want to be stopped by the need to implement major features.
UI Design unfortunately is trickier, and here you indeed need some book recommendations (which are off topic here). Other than book recommendations, my advice is that you focus on rapid prototyping.
In addition, I strongly recommend you use an existing GUI framework for C++ and OpenGL - because these are the technologies you decided to use - then look for tutorials specific to that framework. Using an existing framework will allow you to skip many "minor" issues which become a lot bigger once you have to solve them on your own. A great example of these "minor" issues is UI resizing for different screen sizes and resolutions.
To learn about Development, the best you can do is to look at multiple existing complete frameworks (QT, WPF, etc), and try to figure out what is the same and what is different, and try to guess why.
