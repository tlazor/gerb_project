The "Blaster" worm exploited computers on the internet, simply by spamming itself to large numbers of random IP addresses:
However, for all practical purposes, Internet connectivity is a must in order to get the system updated - which is a fundamental first measure towards securing the machine.
During the OS install, there's not likely to be much risk since most of the actual installation is generally done without network connectivity or with very limited functionality enabled.  After the OS is installed though, and you're working on the first system boot, the system will be vulnerable.
An OS is patched often against vulnerabilities. If you're doing a vanilla installation (without the latest patches and/or Service Packs), there's a chance that the installation gets infected while connected to internet.
Is it possible for malicious users on the internet to gain access to my machine while I am installing OS on it?
Depends whether your machine is directly connected to the internet (like a single client device ADSL or Cable modem, or being behind a NAT, but chosen as DMZ). If it's behind a NAT it's unlikely to get infected.
Immediately after connecting to the network, update the OS and all pre-loaded software via known-good and trusted websites or built-in updating mechanisms.
