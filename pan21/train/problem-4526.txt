I would, therefore, say that answer D seems to be the most correct of those options.  (Though I would favor .192, as more groups = more addresses unavailable for host IDs.  But I cannot endorse an answer that includes clearly incorrect information, so answer B is unacceptable.)
Note that some people have historically instructed people to not use the last subnet.  I was taught that Cisco used to teach that as official recommendation, but their more recent official recommendations indicate that the last subnet is usable.  If you're using the older style of recommendations, the answer would be A.  So the preferred answer depends on what you've been taught.
.230 is 11100110 so it does not have all of the 1s on the left side.  This is not commonly supported by most modern IPv4 implementations, and is therefore rejected.
.192 lets you split it into four groups, which start with .0 and .64 and .128 and .192.  However, subnet IDs of .32 and .96 and .160 are not available when using the .192 subnet mask, so answer B is not fully correct.
It may be helpful for you to view a VLSM Chart.  At the bottom of the hyperlinked chart, you can see that a /27 has a subnet mask that ends with "224" (in the row showing the subnet mask's "Last 8 bits as decimal").
