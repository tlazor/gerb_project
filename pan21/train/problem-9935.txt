If they're just APs (and identical), and not wireless routers, you should be able to save the config from the first, import it into the 2nd, and just change the AP's IP. 
Or....seems like I have recommended this alot lately.  If you have another router, try running DDWRT on it in repeater mode.  
It can be thought of essentially a central access point with multiple 'antennas' on the network. However, this is comparatively very expensive.
My house is just a little too big to get good wireless access in all corners.  I'd like to add a second access point.  I can do this, but I have to manually configure this second AP to have the same keys, etc.  Is there any way I can get this second access point to get its configuration from the primary one?  What would this be called and what sort of hardware or firmware do I need to do this?
For a home setup, if you have two APs as the same model, you could write a script to run on a host on the network that automatically pulls the config via the network from the first AP, tweaks a few values (IP address, name, etc.) and pushes it to the second device.
However, unless you change parameters often, it's probably easiest just to configure the second device manually.
I agree with getting a range extender/repeater.  If possible, try to buy one that is the same brand as your router.  We seem to have had issues with DLink repeaters working with Linksys routers, but if we stick with Linksys it works fine.
