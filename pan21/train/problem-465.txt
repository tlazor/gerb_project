The 5GHz band, however, requires a license and so only the higher-end routers support it.  But because they cost more, fewer people have them and the 5GHz band is almost always wide open wherever you go.
One more thing I could suggest...  If your wireless router has antennas that can be unscrewed from the back, try investing in some high-gain antennas. The connectors are standard and you can buy them online.  You'd need to buy three sets though; one for each of the extenders and one for the router itself.
I don't know how regulations work in the UK, but in the US wireless routers come in two frequency ranges; 2.4GHz and 5GHz.  The 2.4GHz frequency is unlincensed, so practically everybody uses it.  In a crowded neighborhood with lots of WiFi stations, the 2.4GHz spectrum can become quite crowded, leading to a situation where your computer says the signal is good but you still can't connect (or the speed is garbage despite the link speed being reported).
If dual-band routers are a thing in the UK, I would recommend using the less-used band if you can.  Note that higher frequencies have a shorter range, so if you actually are having a range issue, this would make it worse, not better.
