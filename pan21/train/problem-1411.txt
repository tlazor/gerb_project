If the machine is not under warranty and you cannot find the replacement parts (and/or do not feel comfortable replacing them) then you could try and find an experienced repair center, they may have some advice.
Many laptops have replaceable keyboards, and you can usually search the manufacturers page, Amazon, newegg, or e.g. various parts sites for replacements. Be sure you get the correct parts. The X200's keyboard may not be replaceable, in which case, you may be out of luck, but do some research first.
Just to have other methods on record, I asked a (different) friend, who suggested two other possible solutions (yet to be tried!) for this problem:  
Ignoring the fact that Windex and other products with ammonia shouldn't be used on LCD panels ("These chemicals can ... permanently discolor the screen or cause other kinds of damage"), it smells of a hardware problem. 
If the Windex caused the problem, I suppose you could try removing the battery and spraying out the keyboard with electrical contact cleaner, although it might be a long shot if permanent damage was done.
If the machine is still under warranty and your warranty covers damage like this you could contact ASUS or the vendor for a service request.
