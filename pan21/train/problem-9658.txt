Since you already located most of the time spent in the kernel, I'd suggest enabling CONFIG_LATENCYTOP and running, well, latencytop to see more. Can be done with oprofile, too, but latencytop is way more convenient.
I suspect your system is running out of semaphores.  Check ipcs -l for current settings.  Here's some info about tuning semaphores for postgresql.  In particular I would try increasing the maximum number of semaphores system-wide (SEMMNS) and the maximum number of semaphores per set (SEMMSL).  You can use sysctl -p to modify these settings.
We ran across a similar issue (different in that the pauses were minutes apart) when we deployed our Oracle servers on servers with 96Gb memory for the first time. We ended up tracking it down to the kernel process in charge of identifying memory that could be paged out. Setting the process to check smaller chunks more often took care of the problem.
Ubuntu seems to have a bad habit of requiring real random numbers from the system when it doesn't need to, which can cause situations like this.  Try and get the hardware random number generator working, it makes the issues go away, if you have it.
