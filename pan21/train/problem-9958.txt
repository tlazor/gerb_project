Unless you specifically need this to be an FTP interface for compatibility reasons, you might want to try a different approach.
It would be a lot more helpful if you provided your usage scenario so we can cater the solution to your needs. For example, lets say you are a photographer and you don't want to download all of the 20 megapixel picture just based on file name. You can setup some type of FTP server that is also connected to a web front end gallery application. You browse the webpage to identify the images you want via thumbnail, then you go to your traditional FTP interface to download based on file name.
Something that might work really well for you use case is https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload. I used this to let people uplaod files for me and it does image previews. There are obviously more sophisticated tools out there, but this is just an example.
It sounds to me like you might be better off with a document management system that is web based rather than a pure FTP server. You can look into something like SharePoint or Knowledge Tree. These provide the ability to upload and download like an FTP (not sure if they have a native FTP interface, but I know they can integrate with the file system via DAV), but they are web based so they can show thumbnails.
