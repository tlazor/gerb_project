the bindings start in key_bindings_init() in key-bindings.c, but some of the details are spread out with the individual command definitions (e.g. cmd_select_window_key_binding() in cmd-select-window.c).
With tmux 1.7, show-options can also show you the value of a single option (prior versions can only list all the options from the specified class):
The default configuration is not available as a normal configuration file; it is part of the source code (thus built into the compiled program).
If you are interested in the default configuration that a “pristine” server would have, then you can examine those items like this:
The -L unconfigured bit specifies a server socket that you are probably not already using (if you happen to have a server using that socket name, then just pick some other, unused name). The -f /dev/null makes sure that the server does not use your normal ~/.tmux.conf configuration file (though, short of a custom build, there is no way to skip the /etc/tmux.conf system configuration file). The start-server command is necessary because only certain commands will automatically start a server.
