I am a network administrator with a company that operates on several Windows 2003 2008 servers. I restart servers on a monthly basis typically not waiting longer than 3 months, as it is very crucial to be down for that short period of time. 
Right answer is never unless you do software upgrade. Last time I rebooted my server about 2 years ago and reason was power failure.
I used to restart all my Windows servers each week and there was certainly a time when that was required. These days I only restart them when an update requires it. Of course that means they still get restarted every few weeks anyway.
All you Windows Haters should check out the Netcraft.com Sites with longest running systems by average uptime (http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/today/top.avg.html).  This shows the sites that have been running longest since their last reboot and 95% of the top 50 are Windows 2003 and 2000 machines.  As always, your mileage may vary.  
However, with patches and windows updates I will be installing WSUS on a domain controller to apply updates etc. on a schedule based on my liking. This is to avoid any servers from updating themselves and unexpectedly rebooting...
