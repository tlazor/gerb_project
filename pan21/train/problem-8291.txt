The commercial variant seems to aim to create a Windows Server "soon", but apart from that, I can't help you with the Windows side of your question.
There's a remote X variant called NX, marketed commercially by NoMachine and in open source variants by the freeNX and NeatX projects. It's basically an improved remote X protocol including local caching and being transported, compressed, over SSH. If you can use this (it will, of course, depend on the installation of a small server on your remote machines), it'll probably improve the situation far more than manual tuning because you can't configure a local cache for X drawing primitives, which NX does.
I like it a lot, but there's one difference to ssh -X: you'll be presented with a login dialog and the entire desktop of the remote machine, not just your app. That, at the same time, is a great advantage over VNC: With VNC, you can only ever have one mouse pointer on the machine, so it's essentially single-user. NX gives you real sessions and allows several users in parallel.
