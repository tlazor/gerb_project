When I install a Firefox extension, I am prompted a list of permissions required for the extension to work. I've accepted them.
Well, I've asked on Twitter and someone answered that these permissions are also displayed on the page of the extension itself (without requiring to reinstall it)
Today, I've heard about the spylish issue: one of the extension (Stylish) seems to be a big spyware (hence I've removed it).
But I'm wondering if some other Firefox extensions could do the same. Therefore, I would like to see the permissions I've granted to each of the extensions I already have installed. Is there a way to do such check? I don't remember the permissions each of these required, and I'm willing to recheck them now.
An easy way to review all add-on permissions in Firefox Quantum is with the extension Project Insight. It displays all permission of enabled add-ons:
Sorry I was dumb enough to not even notice this (and I admit, to haven't read the entire page at all)... I guess I'll need to open the page of every extension I've installed and see what permission each uses.
