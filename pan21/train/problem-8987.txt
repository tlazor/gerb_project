Now, if you're worried about protecting your data, please make sure that you don't solely rely on your RAID1 array.  It is not a backup solution!  Make sure you backup your important data, take it offline, and take it offsite.
I'm planning to buy a NAS (network attached storage) box and I've picked the Synology DS209. I want to set up a RAID 1 array and I'm wondering if I should buy a matching pair of hard drives or if it would be better to buy from different manufacturers. I'm concerned that a matching pair would be more likely to fail at the same time.
Go ahead and buy from the same manufacturer, the chance that they would fail at the same time just because of that is highly unlikely. There is also a risk that one of the drives is slower, meaning that the faster drive will have to adapt to the slower one.
I wouldn't be concerned with 2 drives from the same manufacturer dying at the same time.  The odds of that happening are tremendous -- probably equal to that of 2 drives from different manufacturers dying at the same time.
A general rule-of-thumb is to have matching disks in the array.  The characteristics of each manufacture will differ, so the more similar the disks, the less like the RAID controller will have to deal with data corruption.  That said, you don't have to use matched disks.  For instance, make sure you replace a failed disk with another the same size or larger.
