Ok, so it seems this should be called Move (or MovePiece if you prefer). To be honest, I think that should be a method of ChessGame rather than Board, but that's by the by.
temp as a name implies to me that the variable is being used in a swap, or maybe as a factored out part of a complex expression. For a loop variable, why not man? (Or piece, since that's what the base class is called?)
See previous comments about the identity of a man. You shouldn't need to do a linear search to find out whether a man is black or white.
So far I think I've found at least five bugs, and I'm only 40% of the way through the code. No interviewer would have stuck with it as long as I have, and I'm not going any further.
Also, what about the case where a white man tries to move to an occupied square? Not handled at all.
What are these doing there? (The obvious answer would be that you used the default template in VS and didn't bother to clean up, but I hope that you have a better explanation than that).
Generally the idea of a constructor is to construct, not to implement the logic of an entire program.
We're still in InitWhitePieces, so this looks like more copy-paste which either means that it's unnecessary code in both Init***Pieces methods or that there's a bug.
What is the identity of a chess man? I would say it's colour and type. Its location at any given time is a property of the game, not the man, so I don't understand why locations are being passed into the constructors, nor why the men are not being added to a 2D board structure (perhaps encapsulated by the Board class).
