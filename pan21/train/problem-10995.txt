The query search for businesses within a circle that contains certain character. Typical data looks like this 
Yes, an index is used in both cases, just with different operators.  The key to determining whether a query has used an index or not is the "cursor" : field.  If this says BasicCursor then no index was used (a table scan was performed).  Otherwise an index was used.
You have not listed what indexes you have defined, but if you wanted to attempt to speed things up you can try adding a compound index.  Remember a query in MongoDB can only use one index at a time and for the geo commands to work that must be a 2d/geo index, so if you have indexes on your other fields, they will not be used unless they are part of a compound index with your geo index.  You should also note that the 2d index must currently be the first field in the compound index, per here:
In your case you are using a "2d" geo index each time, in fact for $nearsphere and $within, $centersphere to work, you must be using a geo index.
As for the rest of the output, they are both returning 50 objects, the first is significantly faster.  You can see the explanation of the various fields here:
