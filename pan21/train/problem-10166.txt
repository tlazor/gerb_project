Since about 3 days (without changing any DNS records), my email does not arrive anymore on my gmail account. I have 1 other domains where emails are forwarded in a similar way (to the same gmail account), but they do still arrive.
I have my own (personal) domain where all email sent to this domain is forwarded to my Gmail account. For this purpose I use the ZoneEdit MailForward function.
What can be the reason that the email does not arrive anymore? The domain (website) is still active and has not yet expired. Is there some sort of mail policy introduced (like SPF?) that prevents mail forwarding?
I've already placed a couple of tech support calls with the company that owns Zoneedit, they're aware of the problem and tell me the guys that manage the server in Vancouver, BC are working on the problem.  It troubles me that it has been going on this long and still hasn't been resolved.
zoneedit has been having problems with their mail forwarding for almost a week now.  I noticed it when emails sent to my forwarded domain didn't arrive and people asked me what was up.  I experimented with changing the forwarding to point to several completely different destination accounts with no luck.  Then I used telnet to connect to port 25 of mail.zoneedit.com and test the connection and found that the mail server is rejecting connections due to it being unable to do a reverse address lookup on the IP address of the system attempting to connect, presumably a mail server attempting to send a message to the mail forwarder.
