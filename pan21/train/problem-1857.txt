Second, you'll probably need to use fdisk or parted or the like to print out your current partition table and the types of each partition so we can see what you have on the drive now, unless you have a second harddisk you will use for windows.  Some partition types can be resized and moved around without much risk, others will need you to back everything up and start over with a blank drive.
I hope that this is a joke, but if it's not you're going to have a problem with hardware compatibility. You won't be able to find any modern hardware that has 98(SE) drivers for it. Instead, you should use a virtualization platform inside of Debian that still supports 98
Honestly, though, I agree with MarkM's answer. It may not be fast but installing win98 in bochs is probably easier.  This guide is for running Win98 in bochs in Windows, but it should be mostly the same in Linux.
If you can resize the partitions (see parted's manual for resize and move) then you'd start by shrinking your Linux partition to make space for a windows partition, then possibly (again, depending on your partitions and drive) moving the linux partition to make free space at the beginning of the drive for Windows, then 
First thing: make sure you have a boot cd or thumb drive that can boot your Linux system because the windows installer will replace Linux's bootloader with its own.  For partition editing you'll probably need a live CD or at least an install CD with the partition editing tools on it as well.
