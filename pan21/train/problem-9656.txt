When I do go into safe mode, I have a limited time to do anything as the screen goes black without warning.
When turned on, computer boots up and starts loading windows, only to forcefully restart, and boot up again where I am greeted with the option to go in safe mode.
The CMOS battery seems to work fine, as the date and time in bios remains correct. I have no other computer to test my GPU. I have two power supplies, one listed above, the other a Rosewill 750W.
I've been troubleshooting a few problems recently, this is my most recent one. My power supply is the only one thats new, but everything else is only a few months old. I've ran the system with everything but the graphics card, so I'm pretty sure the problem lies somewhere there, but I have no idea how to go about it.
Just yesterday, I had the entire system working for a while. Everything was initially in a water cooling system and after taking it all down, the only thing that didn't have any kind of cooling was the GPU so I just had a room fan blowing on it. I managed to run it, so I ran a benchmark to see if the GPU still performed well while monitoring temps. It raised quickly to 80 degrees, probably cause the water block was still on it, and ended up restarting the whole computer. I didn't try it again. 
So, is my graphics card dead? I still have warranty on it, but I'd at least like to try to find a fix.
