The 255.255.255.255 in the logfile is the subnet mask, the IP addresses sending the UDP packets is 192.168.41.11. You need to allow UDP Traffic from this IP address.
I am under the impression there is a superseding rule that is blocking this broadcast message but i cannot find anything in the gpedit local policy. Below is the blocked packets for reference.
Our best conclusion was that the network was being flooded with so much traffic that the firewall was acting out of the norm. Once we reduced the network load, it seems this problem went away. 
We have a game server that is broadcasting updates over 255.255.255.255 to our wireless devices. The messages are reaching the machine (verified through wireshark), but are being dropped by the local firewall. We have created rules to allow inbound traffic from UDP port 2304 as well as local port to the range seen below. We have gone as far as allowing all UDP ports for inbound and we still had the issue with the ports being blocked and showing up in the firewall log.
