"General Concept" is a pretty vague term. If general enough ie. "a protagonist and his or her rag-tag gang of accomplices fight against an evil galactic empire/wizard/high-school principle for freedom and justice using magic spells/mutant powers/zany pranks" then you're probably within your rights to try a new variation on an old theme.  Obviously this entails creating your own story.
If you have any serious plans to share your game with the public (commercially or otherwise) the only responsible thing to do is seek permission from the copyright holder. Anything else is likely to attract some form of copyright "problem".
The safest way to avoid ANY "copyright infringement or plagiarism problems" is to NOT base your game on any other person's creative work.

By "problems" I'm including the hassle of responding to an allegation that your work infringes theirs---even if, according to the laws of what ever country your working in---it doesn't.  A helpful rule of thumb is: if the original work is at all recognizable in yours, someone will probably think you're infringing and may make an issue of it. Reproducing the original story thread, or setting your action in the original author's universe is pretty likely to raise a red flag.
