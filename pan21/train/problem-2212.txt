As for test software there are some things found on the Ultimate Boot CD that might help, but really if the CPU is failing you're going to get lots of quirky stuff going on that may seem totally random.
I've got a machine in which I suspect that the CPU might be failing, but the symptoms are weird enough that I'm not certain...
Is there any software that would test the reliability of a CPU? Like, check how all the instructions are working, verify that cache is not damaged, check for known CPU bugs, etc.
It would seem that the only way to truly test it is to get another CPU and swap it out to see what happens then. There's not too much that'll "stress test" a CPU other than just using it a lot. Otherwise symptoms could point to a bad CPU or to bad memory or poorly seated CPU/memory or something failing on the motherboard or socket...issues with these components are hard to track down, primarily because software used to test it can tell you potentially that there is a problem, but never that there's not a problem (it's like asking your brain to evaluate yourself...can't do it without bias in the perception of the brain's own state. There are plenty of cases where people ask about testing memory and various burn-in testing programs can say memory is fine but suddenly crashes go away after the module is replaced).
