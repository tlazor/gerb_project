The perception of "clarity" of the failure message is going to be different for non-tech personnel. A typical message like
For example if the user was supposed to receive an email from a third party but it hasn't arrived, they'd be able to check the web page and see a list of emails rejected by Postfix, along with a clear reason as to why.
is rather going to confuse any non-tech-savvy user than give her the comfort that everything is running as it should.
It would be easy technically - running something like egrep "postfix.*reject" /var/log/mail.info and posting the output to a web page (e.g. through a CGI script) is a no-brainer. As a more sophisticated alternative, you could use AWStats to process your mail logs and create aggregate reports which would expand upon request. 
The product is called Mailtrace. With a little begging (and paying) they will provide a version in your language.
A user would like to be able to view a web page showing any emails that a Postfix server has either been unable to send, or unable to receive.
There already is a solution for that. It is not free and the company has only a German Website and a German Web GUI. But it is amazing as it continuously parses the log files, assembles them (as one mail produces multiple [related] log entries), put them into a database and provides a web based GUI. It is also possible to map meaningless reject messages to extended valuable messages.
I've been unable to find an existing application that offers this functionality. Does anyone know of any, or is the best way forward to write a script that parses the log and display the results?
