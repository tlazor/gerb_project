What I need is to have LAN clients within 192.168.1.128/25 have all their traffic redirected to 192.168.1.5, even when their IP is set by the router's DHCP and their gateway becomes 192.168.1.1. In other words, clients within 192.168.1.128/25 should work as if their gateway was 192.168.1.5.
I'm currently using this hack as a proof-of-concept;  I'm still online, and a table query shows that the /1 route is being used.
I have a Debian Jessie box at 192.168.1.5 connected to the router (at 192.168.1.1) running an OpenVPN client (it's actually a Pi using this setup. The only part different is that the Pi's eth0 IP is static because of the router, i.e., the Pi is using the router's DHCP).
While DHCP supplied default route remains in place, either of the /1s will be preferred for IPv4 traffic because of their shorter prefixes.
A quick way to override the DHCP-supplied default route (which is a /0) is to add two /1 routes to the VPN gateway:
What's the iptables and/or route add setup the router needs to have to do this (the router runs Tomato 3.4-138)? These are the router settings:
