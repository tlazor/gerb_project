Periodical changing (with period near to DNS record TTL) between two IP also can make balancing. Same effect is using DNS server that support giving different IP to different clients.
For failover inbound traffic, is good to use dynamic DNS. When primary ISP changed, DNS name (with short enough TTL) of site changed to new IP and clients keep access to site.
We use palo-alto firewall as an internet gateway. We have 16 static ip-addresses. One is used for outbound traffic (users browse internet) . The rest is used for inbound traffic (mail server, webservers, etc). 
For redundant purposes we subscribe to second ISP. We buy 16 new static ip-addresses from new ISP. And here comes the hell with configuration. I've been reading for two days about BGP, PI addresses, AS numbers and other stuff. But I don't understand anything. Theory without practice and overall understanding is nothing. I call to these ISP's, and both providers say they won't configure any routes and won't sell AS numbers, try solve it by your selves. In our small asian country there is no LISP or any other cloud base routing solution. I don't know what to do next. Should I request AS number directly from APNIC? With policy based rules I may only configure outbound traffic redundancy. Is there any reliable solution to make redundant our small hosting? May it is possible to configure BGP without AS numbers and PI addresses?
