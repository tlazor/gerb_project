When I try to touch a file as a user (a user that exists on both systems with different UIDs), I get permission denied.  The user is a member of the proper group on both systems (the group has different GIDs on both environment, but the user is a proper member on both sides).
Based on that info, it looks like UID/GID translation is working properly.  Here's the rub (on the client box)...
There are other options for fixing my issue (using NFSv3 and re-mapping UID/GIDs), but I don't want to do that if I can avoid it.
My issue is the NFS mount.  I am trying to use NFSv4 due to it passing IDs as strings, not as numbers (which should help for mapping).  I can get a filesystem mounted on the old environment, and when I do an ls -l, I see the correct names on both sides (so the mapping is working).
So, from everything I can see...the UID/GID translation is working properly, I just can't write files as a non-root user on the client.
I am attempting to use an NFSv4 mount across two systems that do not share UID/GIDs.  This is for a system migration where the old environment used whatever UID/GIDs were available, and they now conflict on the new environment.  I've given all the users new non-conflicting IDs on the new environment.
