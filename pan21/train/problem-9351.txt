As noted by Toby Speight in the comments, there is no need to use Windows.h. SDL provides SDL_GetTicks() for timing, and SDL_Delay() for waiting on the current thread.
If the user minimizes or unfocuses the game window, they want to use resources for something else, so we should use Sleep or SDL_Delay to consume less CPU. It doesn't matter if we wake up slightly late and have a choppy frame rate, because the user isn't paying attention, so there's no reason to call timeBeginPeriod. (The physics will still behave properly if we've fixed the time step, and we may even have paused the game so there's not much to update anyway).
For a PC game, don't limit the frame rate while the user's attention is on the game. Generally we expect games to run smoothly and respond immediately to user input, and since they occupy the user's full attention, consumption of resources isn't an issue.
The SDL cleanup code should be outside the main loop. There will probably be other reasons to exit (e.g. pressing the escape key or clicking on a quit button), and we don't want to duplicate that code.
