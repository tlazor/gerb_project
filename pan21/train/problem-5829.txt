Dovecot is the modern choice for a fast, lightweight IMAP server that supports SSL and LDAP easily. It supports a whole lot of load faster and more efficiently than Courier or Cyrus and uses traditional Maildir - our Dovecot runs like a champ and is utterly reliable.
Since you mention calendar as well, I'd have to mention "radicale".  It a CalDAV server, lightweight, works, and easy-to-configure.  CalDAV is supported everywhere nowadays, so you shouldn't have any issues.
I don't know if nowdays the others have this feature but I can confirm that Cyrus administration is a real pain. Maybe there are some distributions that have a web interface for that but I'm now aware of them.
If you want a full Exchange solution what you want is to engage a product that has already done this, as it's no easy task -- in most if not all of the real solutions the clients must install a custom plugin in Outlook. Take a look at http://www.zimbra.com/ for one of the most popular solutions out there.
Dovecot works fine for me; Courier is a little creaky, and Cyrus has one too many non-standardnesses (mostly in it's storage format) for me to be completely comfortable with it.  All will integrate with LDAP easily enough; if you're trying to roll your IMAP server into your calendar, though, you're doing it wrong.
Few years ago, before switching to Google Apps, I used Cyrus because it was the most feature complete having shared-folders. These are very useful for small businesses because it does enable you to share emails by dragging them from one folder to another.
