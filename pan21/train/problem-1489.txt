For doing this interactively in an existing xterm, you can use the menu on the "Control middle mouse" button.  There is an item in the menu for "Scroll to bottom on TTY output" which is initially checked by default, you just click that and it will remove the check mark and the xterm will no longer jump to the bottom whenever there's output.
Depends on the terminal program you are using.  You should be able to find this information in the documentation for it.  Most are based around the original xterm, which is the one I use, so I'll answer based on that.
I knew all of these options existed, and just used man xterm right now to get the details.  One of the great feature of UNIX (followed for the most part in Linux) is that all of the documentation is right there.  You just have to look at it.
If you want a specific xterm to start off that way, there is a command line option -si which will start it off unchecked.  If you want this to be the default for all xterms, you can set the scrollTtyOutput resource (wherever you set your X resources, and you can use the Xresource structure to make it apply only to some xterms).
