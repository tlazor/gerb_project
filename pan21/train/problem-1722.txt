The windows backup is really just a large zip file. So, use your favorite zip utility (winzip, winrar, 7zip, etc) look at the files, then extract the files that you want.
What steps to take to recreate the users and restore their files to get back as quickly as possible?
Not a simple scenario and pray the user has not encrypted folders. Whenever i face this problem i attempt to organize the files in a folder and place them in the desktop of your user. Organize whatever you kows need tech knowledge and the user is unaware of, for example, firefox and thunderbird profiles or outlook files. With not much effort you can replace messenger history and internet explorer favorites and alike. Other files will be placed in thatbig folder for your user to organize by herself. The reason is the IDs of users are different despite they have the save name, a security issue, i guess... Ah, don't forget to set the permissions on the user files.
Situation: given a good user-level Windows 7 Backup (i.e. a "Windows Backup" of their Documents and Pictures and the like), but not an entire-disk backup.
