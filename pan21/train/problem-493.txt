You should save the contents of the drive somewhere and then reformat it as fat32. Then you can copy them back and it'll be read-writeable by both windows and macos. Note you may see some .data folders appear on the windows side, these are metadata folders, and aren't harmful.
As mentioned, your drive is likely formatted as NTFS right now. Tuxera and Paragon have great NTFS products which are not free, and in my experience ntfs-3g has been quite slow. On the other hand, MacDrive will allow you to access an HFS+ partition on Windows.
But exFAT is already built-in to both Windows and OS X and gets past the limitations of FAT32 while providing speedy native access to the data.
Alternatively you could download the ntfs-3g filesystem, this is a userspace filesystem based on fuse. If that frightens you in any way, i'd resort to the first idea above.
Intel-based Macs such as your MacBook Pro cannot boot from drives that use Master Boot Record (MBR) or Apple Partition Map for mapping out which partition is where, and they cannot boot from any volume formats other than HFS+.
Along with the other good answers, I'd like to point out that if you want to have the option to boot the Mac from the external hard drive — which I highly recommend for the sake of future system troubleshooting — then you must use a GUID Partition Table (GPT) on the drive, and have at least one HFS+ partition big enough for Mac OS X (I usually use 20GB for bootable Mac OS X partitions, as it's big enough for a full install of Mac OS X plus some files, but you might be able to get away with smaller than that).
If you're running the latest version of OS X Snow Leopard, you should format your external drive using the exFAT file system. It is fully compatible with both Windows and OS X and gets past the many limitations of FAT32 (the most annoying of which is the 4 GB file size limit).
