how many cpu/core per machine ? hitting 100% on many core would mean a multithread application eating all ressources.
We had a similar problem with our Internet monitoring software, and it turned out that the XTE (session reliability) process had corrupted the WinSock library and/or the TCP/IP stack.  To repair the TCP/IP stack, run the command "netsh winsock reset" on the Citrix server and reboot.
One of our clients uses BigBrother which is a remote monitoring/health status for servers. Had a quick play myself with the trial but left it as it's also in the big-corp arena.
As an aside, AppSense performance manager works really well at handling peaks in CPU load on XenApp. It would recommend it except it's too expensive IMHO. Each time we reach capacity of our servers we go "AppSense or another server?". We've always gone with the later as at Â£1,000 it's just over-priced for what it does. Even more the case now that we're running free XenServer and can clone an existing XenApp server in an hour.
ProcessExplorer (free) is a useful tool for digging down deeper into processes running, esp. those running under svchost.exe which are normally hidden. We had a case where a HP printer driver (a perennial problem) was running at 100% on one core. ProcessExplorer allowed us to a) find the command line that was used to launch it (which revealed it was HP) and b) kill just that task. Recommended...
