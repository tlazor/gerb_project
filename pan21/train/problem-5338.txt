Installation under Linux is simple because packages are provided â€“ instructions here. Before the first usage, go to the local target directory and configure access to your Google Drive with:
Without the -export option, Google Docs & Spreadsheet files would end up locally just as links in .desktop files. You can configure exporting to other formats as well [see].
You can use the open source command-line utility drive to back up your Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets etc. by exporting them and all other files in Google Drive by downloading them.
File->Download File As... and select the type, then you can save it locally to your desktop. Not really automated, but it will make a local backup.
(This seems to work for both traditional Google accounts and Google Apps Premium accounts, the only ones I've got available to test)
Click on the "Download" button, it might take a few minutes to prepare the ZIP file if you have a large volume of documents.
Change tabs from "Selected Items" to "All Items" and configure how you would like your different documents to be downloaded.
This is my favourite solution because it can be fully automated. However, "it probably doesn't work on Windows" [source], so may not be suitable for your case.
There is a Python script where you can choose output format. It simply downloads ans converts you documents and puts them in a directory.
There is a new feature in Google Docs where it is possible to download all of your documents as a zip file.
