Depends. You need SCVMM to do P2V migration and it does provide a nice overview of the status of the VM's and better snapshotting functionality, but no, you don't (and it's much, much cheaper if you choose not to use it)
We are ready to deploy our first Hyper-V server with 3 VMs. Just wanted to get other peoples thoughts on Microsoft SCVMM. Do we really need it with only 1 host server? It seems like a good option if you have more than 1 hyper-v host. Are many people using it with only 1 hyper-v host server?
I found that DPM had some serious shortcomings (we switched back to Backup Exec, thank God for technet subscriptions), but they weren't related to SCVMM. To do D2D you can't use removable disks (!!), but yes, it can be the same host as Hyper-V and SCVMM (same caveat applies, it can't be installed on Hyper-V Core)
Also, can it be installed on the Hyper-v host? Or does it require it's own server? What about the Microsoft Data Protection Manager. Are there any real benefits to using these tools with 1 host server? Can they be installed on the host server?
