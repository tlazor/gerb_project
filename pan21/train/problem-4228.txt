HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services can give you a lot of info that you might want.  Tread with caution.
xnet.exe available from a few locations (e.g. http://www.netware.se/en/downloads/) can list all the services running - you can then use something else to search the output.  Handlily xnet also reports the short name of a service, which can be used to manage it.
When you want to run a service, you have very limited capabilities, in all current Windows versions, as far as I can tell.  
I hope this helps and also hope that Microsoft implements the search box in the MMC view of Windows Services.
And the MMC snap-in in Win7 now has an Export List button, exporting to csv text file feature which I have used from time to time, to export and then search.   I have thought of writing my own tool. I'm hoping a better "service manager" utility exists out there that sysadmins use.  I'd like a search box at the top right corner, kind of the same way that the Add-Remove-Programs dialog in Win7 and Vista has a search facility.  
I usually start Services by typing "services.msc" into the Start->Run box, on most versions of Windows, this works.  I know how to click the "Name" column in the MMC view of Windows Services. If you know what the first few characters of a service name is, you can usually sort by the name, and type the prefix to scroll the list down (find Windows Search for example).   
The best I could do is "NET SERVICES" from the command line, and maybe add a grep in there, but that doesn't list every service, only a few of them.
This seems pretty weak to me, so I spent some time searching the interwebs for tools that do a better job of managing services.  Usually I have a keyword that I know "fooWare" might be the keyword, and I need to find the (usually badly named) service and start it and stop it. This is often WAY too hard.
