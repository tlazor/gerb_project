One thing I want to know is whether such a 6-month project is realistic for someone with no background in image processing and pattern recognition? Or is it going to be terribly difficult because I only have had experience with "data-oriented"/statistical machine learning?
I have done several machine learning projects but all of them have been connected to the traditional machine learning (predictions, classifications, etc.). I have currently been offered a project to finish in less than 6 months.
The idea is to develop/improve a pre-existing software. The software takes the image of a molecule from an advanced molecule and then tries to highlight the cell line with red, some times the software takes the background or the lines of other cells also as the highlighted part, and thus the user has to manually edit and trim such mistakes. The idea is to make the software learn from user's edits and behavior over time.
My other question is; what type of concepts/topics should I dig deep into to learn the fundamentals of carrying out this project?
