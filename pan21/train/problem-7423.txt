As it is a breaking change, I would like to have a domain redirection which redirects the old one to the new one. I've configured the same in my DNS Server (BigRock) using their Domain Forwarding System. After that, tamizhvendan.in is redirecting correctly to www.p3programmer.com but blog.tamizhvendan.in resulting in 404 in github pages. By BigRock's documentation, for subdomains will be redirect to path www.example.com\{subdomain} i.e in this scenario it should redirect to www.p3programmer.com\blog but it is not redirecting.
I've added a CNAME record in the tamizhvendan.in account with the value pointing to www.p3programmer.com but yet I am getting github page's 404 page error. 
Github seems to only support one external domain per repository, at least according to their documentation Adding a CNAME file to your repository:
I had my blog on github pages with a custom domain name blog.tamizhvendan.in and today I've moved it to a new domain name www.p3programmer.com by updating the CNAME record with www.p3programmer.com.
