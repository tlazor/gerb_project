According to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727005.aspx it could be in your local NETBIOS name cache.  You can use nbtstat (http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/nbtstat.mspx?mfr=true)  to query/purge this cache.
Also try to deactivate NetBIOS and LMHOSTS for your Network Adapter. You can change the settings in the TCP/IP Properties of the used Network Connection, under Advanced -> WINS.
I also know that @olefebvre already posted something similiar, but I didn't recognize it with its   abbreviations and it's not (only) related to odd characters, it is to bring windows to recognize the file at all.
I know the question has been answered, but it's clear that there are many different reasons and possible solutions. What did the trick for me was to delete the file, rather than to overwrite it. 
After trying many different suggested solutions, I checked the security on the ‘etc’ folder and compared its permissions to that of the ‘es-ES’ folder, and found that the group Users did not have Read & execute rights like they did on the other. After taking ownership (again) of the ‘etc’ folder, I granted group Users Read & execute permissions, and had them inherited by the folder contents. That fixed the problem for me–whatever part of the system queries the hosts file evidently is under the restrictions of the User group. I must have removed the group’s permissions accidentally at some point when trying to modify the hosts file.
