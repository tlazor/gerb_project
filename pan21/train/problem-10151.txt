I have a MacBook and while I can and do connect a second monitor to it, Iâ€™d like to be able to use the larger/nicer/identical monitors connected to my PC to interact with my MacBook.  It seems like it should be possible (using some manner of VNC magic) to configure the MacBook to simulate two monitors, and to access them via VNC on my desktop PC.  
I don't know if it's possible to have a Macbook emulate 2 displays. There are some USB add-ons that give you the ability to run a 2nd monitor, but it is extra hardware that you're looking for.
There is an application called Teleport, which acts as a software KVM switch. As long as they are connected over the network you can do this.
It is Mac to Mac only, but I just thought you may find this useful in a slightly different configuration.
You can use Synergy to access your macbook via keyboard and mouse, so you could conceivably use 3 LCDs (which i believe you already do today) 2 on the PC, and one on your Macbook, but you want dual lcd's on your macbook. I believe the only way to achieve this is with a device like this. You could use the same two LCD's that you use for your pc (assuming they each have dual inputs) and just switch between inputs.
