Saywhat?! That message only shows up for the nodes for Lid Close Action, Power Button and Sleep Button. I can change every other setting except for those three.
I had the same problem and just found the answer here. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110328121602AAFxtHH It worked for me. =]
I tried changing it to sleep in power options like we normally do but for some reason the setting here overrides it.
I have a Samsung 900x laptop and I want to change it so that when I close the lid, nothing happens (I often close the lid to carry it somewhere 10 seconds away, and by putting it into suspend it cancels any active downloads/etc).
Just right click on start menu and click properties and then in the "start menu" tab you will find Power button option.
Please change the plan right now you are having Samsung Optimized and it is like a default setting. You can change it then you will be able to change those settings. I hope this will work if it doesnt then please provide more info.
There's this little program that by doing its work, cancels our options on what closing the lid etc do. It's called Fast Start. Run it, turn it off and now you have a fuller command of your laptop. Hope it works for you as well.
I'm definately an Administrator on the computer, and I've googled the error and found dozens of hits on other crappy forums, but of course nothing on those worked (otherwise, I wouldn't be here). And as ususal the "Why can't..." hyperlink gives no useful infomation what so ever (just a generic Help document).
