Is this your normal template? If so, see the description here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918064, which has a number of suggestions as to what this problem could be.
I had the same problem. I found it was due to IntegriSign.dot, an electronic signiture pad. Once uninstalled, problem finally stopped. It would also change the date on the file from its creation date to today's date, which messes up my ability to find files by date.
You would not believe it but I got no extra dialogs upon saving/closing the document. Seems like I finally cured this illness. I have hardly half an idea of what could have been wrong though. Must be that Word did not save the changes everytime I clicked "yes" to the path the .dotx file was on, but to some mysterious temporary file that got deleted at random times.
I think I've just solved this problem, but if the solution is true it would make the cause of it quite odd.
The template I was talking about was saved in a folder on my data partition. I've recently cleared all Windows caches, MRU etc. and while I previously used the MRU in the start menu to create documents based on that template, I now had to do it via Word itself by opening the "New document" menu.
Strange thing is I used the same menu for creating a template and it just asked me where I wanted to save it.
Upon selecting "my templates", I could not find that template. So what I did is move it from the folder it was in to ~\appdata\roaming\microsoft\templates where ~ is my userdir. Word now found this template to create new documents with and I used it in this way.
