See this thread for migrating the domain controller roles themselves: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winservergen/thread/49afdc39-12b7-414e-9cd8-353fd01b4f31
I have Exchange 2000 on a Windows 2000 server.  The 2k box is also a root forrest server and domain controller and yes I know that's bad.  This Exchange box was the first one ever installed, upgraded from 5.5.  It has no mailboxes, etc.  All I know is that when I turn off the info store and associated services on that 2k box, the other Exchange servers fail (they start but mail stops delivering ).
There are a number of steps you have to take to transfer from Exchange 2000 to 2003. This article gives a good explanation on the steps you need to take. Because it is the first Exchange 2000 server in your organisation there are some extra steps you need to take, explained here.
Thank you for any help.  This is my first step in removing the existing domain controller, which is also the root server for our domain.
How do I get rid of this first Exchange installation?  I have another Exchange 2003 box that is not a domain controller that I want to be the "first" "main" or whatever it is called instead of the old one.
