OpenSSL 1.0.2k has removed 3DES ciphers in default which means some legacy browsers (e.g. IE8 on Windows XP) can no longer be supported.
Don't forgot the shared flag or libssl.so and libcrypto.so won't be built, and use -Wl,-rpath= to tell the linker(ld) to link shared libraries in which directory.
Plus, Can I cover the Openssl installed by DPKG(Debian Package manage tool) with the self-compiled, 3DES-enabled version? If it's practicable, How to?
After that, your custom version of OpenSSL will be installed into /opt/openssl-1.0.2 (rather than cover the version shipped with your OS).
Then get the latest release of OpenSSL, verify the signature and compile it with the option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers, if you want to regain the support of obsolete SSLv3 for the GOD D**N Microsoft IE6, enable-ssl3andenable-ssl3-methodshould also be append to the compile option.
First you should get the tools for building software and the dependencies for OpenSSL.(e.g. On Debian-like distros)
Your applications may also have to be re-compiled, with these options to force the linker to link your custom version of OpenSSL libraries (Override the config from /etc/ld.so.conf or PKGCONFIG variable)
According to OpenSSL official blog, to re-enable 3DES ciphers, we should add enable-weak-ssl-ciphers flag when compiling.
