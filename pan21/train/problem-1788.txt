The actual OS is on a separate partition than boot. You need special software to access this partition if you are using Windows or Mac.
Partition 2 is the root partition and is the main partition containing the Raspbian operating system. It is formated with the ext4 filesystem, a more powerful one than fat. But MS Windows and MAC cannot read this filesystem without helpers. The easiest is to boot your computer with a Linux operating system (Debian, Ubuntu etc.) to access the root partition. There you will also find the /home/ folder.
To elaborate the answer from @Milliways a bit. Raspbian is installed on two partitions. Partition 1 is the boot partition and contains essential files like the kernel to load and firmware and drivers. To be easy readable on boot up it is formated as fat filesystem. This filesystem is readable by nearly all operating systems including MS Windows and MAC.
If you are using a Mac, you can use software called OS X Fuse (instructions on http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/20/mount-ext-linux-file-system-mac/).
