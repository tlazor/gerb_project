In case you have configured kerberos correctly (klist shows krb ticket after kinit) probably there's issue with your machine account in the AD.
The next thing you need to do is verify kerberos keytab. It is used for holding ticket signing ticket. It is created by net ads join or on AD.
Joining AD requires Administrator account or one with permissions to join clients in the domain, because it had to create machine account with unique SID for your pc.
I'm trying to join my RHEL 7 VM machine to our company's AD. I can validate my login credentials just fine with kinit (No return if I enter the correct password, error if I enter the wrong one), however, when I try to join using realmd it says I have insufficient permissions to join. Using net ads join --user=MyUser returns "Failed to set account flags for machine account (NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED)". I do not have administrative access to the AD, however, one of the administrators added my RHEL machine to the AD. I've tried reinstalling samba and krb but that didnt help. I've also played around with the configs but I just can't seem to get it working. Any help would be much appreciated.
As the machine account exists, you probably will not need admin privileges in AD. Also, you do not need to extend the AD schema to cover rfc2307.
