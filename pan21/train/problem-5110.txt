Yes. About that. In my particular case, gpresult is returning the correct list of policies but they're not actually doing what they're supposed to. Evidence in the event-logs suggests they're attempting to apply but failing. This is what suggests a bad profile (specifically a badly created Default User profile, as these are computer-lab stations for students). 
Having spent entirely too much of my life for the past three weeks banging my head on GPO/Profile issues (only on the admin side), I felt some fear reading this question. Happily, we have no ERP deployment going so I feel safe whew.
When a station can't even figure out what GPOs it needs to apply, it's usually pretty noisy about it in the event-logs. I had that happen a month ago, and it turned out that the workstation in question had the NetBIOS TCP/IP Helper service disabled. Another one managed to pick the one Domain Controller it couldn't get to. Both were diagnosed through event-log reading and some network diagnostics on the machine in question.
