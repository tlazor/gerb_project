I am working on a Vagrant + Ansible configuration for my team that sets up a developer VM, some of the artifacts needed are only available from my corporate network either by being physically on it or connected by VPN.
My question: is there is clean way to do such a check in an Ansible "when" statement or something like that. 
If we are provisioning on a machine that is not on that corporate network, I'd like to automatically connect to our vpn (using the openconnect client), copy the file and then disconnect, all from Ansible.
After being registered you can access any of those attributes with dot notation in later parts of the playbook execution.

Without getting too fancy, you may just want to use the command module and register the output, like the following:
