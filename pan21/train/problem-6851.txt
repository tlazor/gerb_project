Additionally, good, actually... perfect DNS and reverse DNS and the lack there of, are at the root of a good NetBackup deployment. 
BRU has a GUI console that works on most *nix machines as well as OS X. Zmanda has a web based gui. BRU abstracts the idea of tape management away from you, instead you define a pool of tapes you want to backup to for a particular job or jobs and it will put data where it can while following your retention rules. Zmanda is just as configurable. 
I'd recommend Symantec's NetBackup if you can afford it.  BackupExec from Symantec is pretty good until you add the Unix clients.  It doesn't do that nearly as well.  
As far as cost is concerned you can get zmanda for free, but BRU will cost you at least $299 for 30 hosts. Both are simple if you've done backups before. 
While NetBackup is infinitely configurable, (with Multiplexing, Multistreaming, Storage Units, Storage Unit Groups, etc) for an easier life resist the urge to configure it infinitely!
NetBackup has an excellent command line interface, as well as a GUI that is good.  I will say it has a few pitfalls in the setup phase, but if you follow the documentation and best practices guides, rather than just jumping in blind it's great. 
HP Dataprotector scales well in a multi-OS environment.  Just check the flavor of Linux you use,  they certify some flavors but not all.  We use it for HP-UX, and Windows.
