The error code you got stands for ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND, some dependent dll is missing on your system that both of those two programs rely on.
One tool I have used a lot for finding problems like these is Dependency Walker, it analyze the dll or the ocx and tell you what other dll's it depends on. 
I'm trying to install a 32bit Oracle instant client onto several Windows 7 PCs.  This version is the one required by the customer's software.  I have successfully installed it on about a dozen PCs using the same installer, but two machines refuse to register a DLL.  The two PCs are of different make and model.  I have been able to install this software in the past on these models.  This is the error that the installer throws up:
To further complicate the issue, one of the two PCs also will not register an OCX file from a different 32bit installer:
Both PCs are relatively new and have standard software installed.  We use MS Forefront for security, but disabling that didn't change the behavior.  What am I missing?
The file copies to the location referenced above.  If I choose to ignore the error and manually register it later, I get the following error:
If it can't find it by static analysis you will need to do it by dynamic analsys and "profiling" the program. I have only worked with exe's so I am not sure how you would run the dll for profiling, perhaps you need to load regsvr32 in dependency walker and launch it with the arguments to load your dll and it may pick it up that way.
This error is returned whether I use the 32bit (syswow64) or 64bit version of regsvr32.  Command Prompt is run as admin, and the ID with which I'm logged into the PC is an admin.  I've tried copying the file into the syswow64 folder, but I get the same error.  This same installer works on other PCs.
