Also, I don't know a whole lot about it, but this sounds like a really good application for a torrenting protocol. It is designed for this kinda thing and plus if the connection to local(internet) computers is dependable but not to computers far away(like, USA and whatnot) then this may allow you to setup an ad hoc P2P network so that when one of their computers gets the update downloaded then it can share it everywhere else without having to download it from such a remote location. 
Symantec Anti Virus Corporate Edition and Symantec Endpoint Protection will support this.  A single file can be dowmloaded to the one with Interent and distributed to the other systems
I also know for a fact that MSE includes an option to scan every USB and CD before it allows access to the rest computer. I have scanned several Flash drives and found viruses.
I say "current" because MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials) doesn't update itself online and doesn't check for the updates, and in your case is not an issue. Once you update MSE once with the definitions, it will not prompt you to do so again and will run without a problem. So download MSE for free at Microsoft and download the definitions and update MSE once and it will give you protection offline. As the computers will not be exposed to the most current viruses, the one time update should be sufficient, but at anytime you can update again easily.  
Microsoft Security Essentials can be moved onto an unconnected computer, installed, and opened, however it will not run unless is has a "current" update of virus definitions. The virus definitions and updates can be downloaded and instructions can be read here on how to do it
