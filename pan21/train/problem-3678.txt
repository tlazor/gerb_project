Appending a dot onto the FQDN ie dev.sc-asphalte.fr resolves correctly, but users don't expect to do this and browsers are not mad about it either giving bad host responses some of the time.
From time to time - which is a bit weird - I have a problem with Windows 2003 DNS resolving these entries. It adds my local domain (cazburo.co.uk) to the DNS search eg sc-asphalte.fr.cazburo.co.uk shown below:
My method is to add the given client's domain to a zone on my DNS server; copy across all the MX records from the primary nameserver; add a www A record; and then my own dev A record.  This way users on my domain (graphic designers, etc) and I get to see the public website and the development website, but the public at large don't get to see the latter.
I am a dev-op (a software developer who has to do IT on the side).  As a website developer, I create DNS host entries on my local Windows 2003 DNS servers - there are two DNS servers in the local domain - so that I can set up IIS7 websites on my Windows 7 development box.  
The rationale for appending a suffix onto the DNS query before attempting to resolve the query 'as is' first eludes me.  However this is the behaviour I would like: attempt resolution 'as-is', then resolve with suffixes, go to fowarders, etc.  Is there any way of achieving this with Windows 2003+ (I'll upgrade from Windows 2003 if necessary)?
