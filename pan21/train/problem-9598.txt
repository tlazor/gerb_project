If - and this is a big if - your provider also supports DOCSIS 3.1, you will benefit from Active Queue Management. AQM is intended to solve bufferbloat, where network devices such as cable modems buffer data in an attempt to increase link utilization at the expense of variable latency. Bufferbloat wreaks havoc with TCP's congestion control algorithm. Instead of real-time rate adjustment in the face of packet loss - what TCP expects on a saturated link - congestion control kicks in only after the buffer fills. If the buffer is large the user sees a pause and latency increase while the buffer drains at the reduced rate. TCP then slowly increases the rate as the buffer fills back up, and the cycle repeats. This whipsaw effect has a huge impact on perceived performance.
No there will be no benefit for you to buy a DOCSIS 3.1 modem vs a DOCSIS 3.0 modem, especially based on criteria #4, does not exceed 50Mbps upstream or 100Mbps downstream (as in, I'm not buying service that's faster than that in the foreseeable future)
DOCSIS 3.1 was made for gigabit speed internet. It supports the following, a whopping: 10,000 Mbps download, 1,000 Mbps upload. 
Even in the 10s of Mbps you may see vastly better day-to-day web, streaming, and gaming performance with DOCSIS 3.1 hardware - again, assuming your provider also supports the standard.

Unless you plan on having multi-gigabit connections very soon, you don't have any reason to buy a DOCSIS 3.1 modem.
