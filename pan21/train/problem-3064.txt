I think maybe the intention of what is being asked for here is getting lost by the distraction of trying to address the literal question of how to get the RAISERROR to work. @wBob asked a great question: "why are you watching it?" The intention here is to have insight into where the process is, how far it has gotten, etc. That doesn't require PRINT or RAISERROR.
Make sure that IF you are grouping the statements inside the loop in a transaction, that this INSERT happens before the BEGIN TRAN.
A better approach would be to create a status table to keep track of this process (although, to be fair, there is merit in @wBob's suggestion to refactor this process to be more set-based, but we don't know the situation and refactoring this might be unfeasible for one or more reasons). So, think about whether you want just the current ID (i.e. just a status) or a running trail of what has happened so far (i.e. a log / history). Assuming you might want a log/history table (it would be the most similar to having the individual messages printing out), create something similar to:
