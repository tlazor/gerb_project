I had the same problem with my Lenovo yoga pro 2,the mouse would just jump around and select thing. I tried different setting for the mouse but it didn't work. I ended up uninstalling the mouse and point devices driver and it fixed the problem so far. If you uninstall it, when you restart the computer it automatically reinstalls the driver for you. It asked me if I wanted to delete it and restart now, I just didn't check that box for deleting and selected ok restart now.
I just reinstalled Windows 8 on my Dell XPS 15 touchscreen laptop and I am having a strange problem. My mouse (apparently) randomly jumps around the screen and clicks something. I was having this problem before I had to reinstall, but it's much more noticable now and is making my computer practically unusable. It has happened 4 times since I started writin...make that 5 times. Once it tried to close the window, another it clicked an ad, another time it minimized all, etc. No apparent pattern.
I have seen similar behavior when the "snap to" option in your mouse settings is enabled and one of your enter keys is sticking.
I have disabled the trackpad and unplugged the mouse and it still happens. I'm up to date on as many drivers as dell will let me download and I am getting to my wits' end.
