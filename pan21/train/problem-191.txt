pull one sata cable off. print label with the missing drive from view disk aka ada1 stick label to side of drive.
I'm building out a FreeNAS based server in a Supermicro X6DHE-XB 3U enclosure with 4G of RAM, 16 SATA hot-swap bays.  It comes with 2x8 port 3Ware RAID cards, but I'm planning on just using the ZFS capabilities instead of the hardware RAID.  My initial drive set will be 8x2TB HITACHI Deskstar 7K3000 HDS723020BLA642 drives.
Step 4 is identifying your failed drive - you will know which by the missing or damaged information reported on the drive. Get the Enclosure # and The Slot # and use them to blink the tray LED in 
LSI maintains versions for FreeBSD, Linux and Windwos. With FreeNAS you will need the FreeBSD version.
You will now see a closeup of the volume and its individual hard drives listed something like ada3p2, ada5p2, ada6p2, ada4p2 etc.
If I was using hardware based RAID, it would give me a red light on the drive bay where the drive failed.  How does it work with ZFS when a drive fails?  I don't think there is any guarantee that sda=bay1, sdb=bay2, etc, so how do you determine which drive needs to be replaced?  Can ZFS report back to the SATA controller to turn on the "failed drive" light?  Does it just report the drive serial number?  What if the drive fails so hard it can't report it's serial number?  I suppose it is a good idea to write down every drive's serial number and which bay it went into before you go live. Are there any other "pre-production" tasks to make replacing drives easier in the future?
