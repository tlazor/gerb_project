Exchange doesn't drop attachments. Exchange 2010 is now in extended support, so nothing will be changing with that product - and hasn't done so for some time. 
I would be looking at the path. AV software installed somewhere, firewall scanning SMTP traffic. As you don't receive the attachment in a Gmail account suggests the problem is between Exchange and the internet. Looking at the headers as received by GMAIL may also give a clue. I have seen attachments get malformed in the past and have ended up in the headers. A firewall scanning SMTP traffic for example could damage the attachment meaning it isn't rendered correctly. Looking at the size of the mail can be clue here - if the size is the same or close to that received by Exchange then that points to the attachment being there but not seen by the client. 
The fact that you getting a copy of the email correctly on a transport rule means the email is passing through Exchange correctly - I think you are too quick to blame Exchange because nothing you have written tells me it is Exchange. Everything goes through Exchange transport - if the problem was with Exchange then the attachment wouldn't reach your mailbox. The attachment is being dropped after it has left Exchange.
