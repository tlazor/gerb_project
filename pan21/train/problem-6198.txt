The ESX userland software is in reality a virtual machine, with limited hardware resources. The vmkernel is the OS with the actual resources aviable (wich distributes it to virtual machines). Doing anything against a ESX server via SSH/FTP/etc is considered to be generally slow.
vmkfstools -i (import) is the recommended way to do this from the command line, you can find some details on the syntax here but use man vmkfstools from the ESX console for accurate syntax.
The vmware service console is rate-limited for network and disk throughput. I do believe the client would run the process faster than performing the operation from the service console.
I have a 8 CPU VmWare ESX server (3.5) with 4 HDD drives in RAID that is not loaded at all. I enabled SSH and installed mc (midnight commander) in order to be able to copy(clone) virtual machines but I observed that if does copy the files very slow - around 3.5mb/s on local drive.
Since you don't provide any info about your RAID hardware I can only guess that you have a low-end RAID-card, with limited cache on it and a 4-disk RAID5 setup. This generally kills I/O performance when copying from/to the same array.
As the others have mentioned the ESX Service Console user environment is not really optimized for performance so apps that are not specifically designed to interface with ESX tend to perform very poorly. Veeam FastSCP generally outperforms anything else that I've tried for copying data directly to\from\between ESX and ESXi hosts and it's worth trying that if you are dealing with multiple ESX(i) systems but if you are moving stuff around (or copying) within the one ESX host then the VI Client or the native console interface\remote CLI tools are what you should be using. 
Also, why are you trying to clone virtual machines with midnight commander? The vSphere Client is the tool to clone virtual machines (right click it).
