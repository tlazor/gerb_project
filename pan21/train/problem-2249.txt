Client server is the big picture, we can also say cloud computing is a derivative of client server architecture.
think cloud as it floats...yep the services also floats in cloud computing, u can use it when you want it and release it after ur work ends, by this user doesn't need any additional resource available with him to use the service, all resources were provided by the cloud. Main advantage of this uses can get things done from anywhere, with any device. 
In some ways, there is little difference. I see cloud computing as very much a subset of client/server architecture; the only difference is the where and how of the server side of things - it doesn't matter if the server is in my data centre or Amazon's "cloud", it's still client/server architecture.
"A massively scalable computing system providing computing power, networking and storage facilities mostly using consolidated virtual computing and storage methodologies to provide on-demand services, resource pooling and fast provisioning (elasticity)." 
Having said that it is obvious that such a system incorporates (actually any serious system must do so) both clusters and client-server services. But also note that the above definitions does not mean that a "cloud" is something super big. Actually a single server with (two) Virtual Machines is a cloud. It is scalable - you can add systems and VM's ad nauseum. it pools resources and has on-demand capabilities. The rest, clusterizing, parallelizing etc etc - are entirely optional which extend capabilities.
I want to know the difference between cloud computing and client server architecture. I mean how is cloud computing different from a website that provides me some services. And what is the meaning of elasticity in terms of cloud computing.
