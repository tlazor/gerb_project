This might seem a little nieve, but I just inserted my unusable SD card into my digital camera, and it seemed to reformat it to a condition where I could proceed with another partitioning.  You also might want to use the minipartion disk tool on windows or the SD card formatter (https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html) to just put one big FAt32 partiton on the card before other Linux partitioning.
I recommend to you to list disk again before clean command to check disk 1 is selected (you can see the exact sizes on list so you can understand which one is your sd card and which should be selected)
console show you disks available on your pc generally disk 0 is local disks (C:,D: etc) and disk 1 points to others like usb flash disk sd card vs
so you have done with the cleaning stuff and assigned the card as g: as a virtual drive you can chose any letters that does not stands for any other virtual drive
You can use a third party software to format your SD card like AOMEI Partition Assistant Download here on Windows or GPARTED on a Linux Distrubution
