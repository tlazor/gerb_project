Testing the connection to the ODBC source only works in SSMS when I use the 64-bit source. When I use the 32-bit ODBC source no connection can be established and the following error is shown:
I found out I can indeed connect to the Salesforce ODBC source and access the data using a 3rd Party Database Manager (Database5Pro 64bit, an SSMS alternative) - but this does not allow me to access both data sources at the same time (no linked objects available).
The Devart driver requires (as mentioned in the installation guide, see page 41) the same bitness of all moving parts. 
Whilst I can connect to the 64-bit source I cannot access the linked server object in SQL Server Management Studio 17.x (32 bit - I believe there is no 64-bit version of SSMS):  
I have problems to access a linked server for a Salesforce ODBC data source with our MS SQL Server 2016 (Standard 64-Bit) using the Devart ODBC Driver for Salesforce in SSMS and SQL Studio Management Studio (17.8.1).
Can anyone suggest a way to use a Salesforce source as a linked server along with SQL Server 2016 in an SSMS-like way? I am open to alternative solutions and 3rd-party tools.
I have also tried an older version of SSMS (2012) and the beta version of SQL Operations Studio (basically VS Code like SSMS, actually a 64-bit application) to no avail.
