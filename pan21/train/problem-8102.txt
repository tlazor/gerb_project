The reason for changing the home directory and/or data directorys would obviously be space. one 'best practice' is to keep the /var directory rather small on a *nix server however sql databases tend to grow big, easiest thing to do then is move them on another partition.
2. Where does the 'mysql' owner and group come from? Does the installation of MySQL on a Linux machine automatically create the 'mysql' user and group? or People need to manually create a mysql account for the linux machine?
1. Why would one run the above command?  If I create a table in my_db database, by default, there will be .frm, .MYD, and .MYI files (data files) be created automatically by MySQL under /var/lib/mysql/my_db/ . So, does the above command changes the default MySQL data directory to /data/tmp/ instead of /var/lib/mysql/my_db/?
on top of that you can change datadir= under [mysqld] in the mysql config file "my.cnf" which will be the place the actual data files are stored
On Ubuntu (which you tagged this), MySQL is usually installed by apt-get. The MySQL APT package includes script that automatically create the MySQL user when the software is installed.
I get confused, I know the meaning of the above command, which is to change the owner of /data/tmp to user 'mysql' and change the group of it to 'mysql' group.
