The initramfs has to be able to mount the root filesystem, and for that, it'll need the kernel modules neccessary to reach that disk, partition & filesystem, unless they are already compiled into the kernel itself. It also needs some way to specify your choice of root filesystem, and the mount options to be used. Some implementations have to update the initramfs image when changing some settings, choosing a different root filesystem, or using different mount options. However, it is possible to write an initramfs implementation which does not need any update, except when changing/upgrading/recompiling the kernel & the modules, by reading the neccessary parameters from the kernel command line. So to know how exactly your initramfs implementation works, you either have to read the script inside, or read the documentation specific to your distro.
What is present in initramfs, and how it gets configured, depends on your implementation. Usually, your Linux distro contains its specific initramfs implementation (so it all depends on what distro you use).
This boot partition has to be readable by grub, so it cannot be within LVM. It is a good practice to create a separate, small primary partition at the front of the boot disk (I usually use 100MB for this, normally mounted as /boot).
