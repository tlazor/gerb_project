You don't see any phpmyadmin folder when accessing your hosting via FTP because it's an alias, some kind of virtual folder.
I've found that many distributions would rather install an application's web files within /usr/lib or /usr/share as a convention. As such, you may want to verify your apache configuration files to determine the exact path. 
In this case, most likely you'll have the phpmyadmin apache directives within a file located within /etc/apache2/conf.d or /etc/httpd/conf.d or the like. The configuration file will have a  statement which will detail the location of your files. 
If you have an SSH access to your hosting, phpMyAdmin is usually located in /usr/share/phpmyadmin. If you don't find it there, try to locate it :
i have www doc in html folder. i go to 192.168.1.1/phpmyadmin to pull it up. but when i ftp there i dont see any phpmyadmin folder under html folder. how can i find where phpmyadmin folder is? i am using centos
It's probably in /var/www/html/phpmyadmin, but take a look at your Apache configuration files to make sure (try grepping for phpmyadmin in all your Apache config directories).
