It looks a bit of OOP bloat there. Personally I don't like a class with getters and setters working with side-effects all over the place. I don't see why not write a simple function. To add some notes to the other answers:
Finally, the method names seem slightly opaque.  Since I don't unserstand exactly what your doing, I didn't attempt to fix this, but it appears "parse" would be the public method used by clients, and that name is vague.  What is the action really accomplishing?  I'd pick the name based on that.  It seems you are syncing with s3, and then returning the results of that sync.  Maybe "sync_results" would be appropriate?
I don't know how widely used or important this class is for your company, so feel free to file any of these under "over-engineering" as appropriate :-).
Depending on how you intend clients to use it, you may want to expose sync (with no output, but storing it's raw results in the object) and sync_results separately?  Parsing is really an implementation detail that has little to do with the intent of the method (I think) and so should not be the name of the method.
