I now Arch. You can't accidentally install over anything as long as you don't choose the "partition automagick" option during install. You are free to use cfdisk before you start the Arch installer, then you can note down the names of the the drives you want to keep. You need room for Arch, so you do indeed need a free partition. You can create this with Ubuntu live disk and Gparted. Resizing is easy with gparted. I don't know how to do that part with the arch install media. 
My new computer's a Samsung R530, and comes with Samsung Recovery Solution 4, which forced me to partition my hard drive before I could get up and running in Windows.
I've just got a new computer with Windows 7 pre-installed. I want to keep Windows but dual boot Arch Linux (I've already installed Arch on another computer so don't need any help with that).
I'm a bit paranoid about installing Arch, because I haven't had much experience with partitioning hard drives. I don't want to accidentally remove the Windows partition (the computer didn't come with Windows install discs).
