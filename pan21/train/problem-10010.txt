After you do this you may notice that you can't get to your printers, etc. do a route add 192.168.1.0/24 -interface $INTF where $INTF is whatever you are using wlan0 or eth0. 
The VPN makes it so that it is "as if you are at work" when you access work machines. A VPN can also handle general Internet traffic, but it doesn't have to, and generally that just wastes resources and isn't done unless there's some specific reason to do so.
If you want to send your traffic through your work for some reason, there are a couple things you can do.
That's because it defaults to split tunnel vs. full tunnel, which is better in many cases.  You wouldn't want your torrents or random browsing habits to be monitored by IT, also that will increase latency, introduce bottlenecks, etc.  
Notice how this makes all your traffic go over the VPN endpoint's Internet connection twice? And what benefit does this provide?
The difference here is basically where your default route is pointed in your routing table.  If it's pointed at your work gateway, that's full tunnel, and if it's pointed at your "home" router gateway that's split tunnel.
For Windows 8: Look if after connecting to the VPN your IP is still displayed as your home country (Google: What is my IP). If yes, open Windows Network center. Look if there is a new network adapter that has no internet connection. Click on it and as an admin, choose properties. Here, allow other users to use this connection und allow the connection for HTTPS and HTTP (or whatever you need to show the VPN IP). You may need to run the automatic Windows 8 troubleshooting wizard for the network and disconnect and reconnect the VPN service. Then, check if the new IP is displayed in your browser.
