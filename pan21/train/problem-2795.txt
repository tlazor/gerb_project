What you might want to do, is use an application (NetLimiter - Block applications, ports from using internet) / firewall (block applications and ports, from internet / network) / proxy (block specific url's) to determine what applications get to use the internet, what ports are allowed, what sites are allowed.
The most effective would be a proxy hosted on a separate machine, a small linux box would be suffice, configuring which url's are accesable, some proxy programs might allow you to limit duration (more accurately, only allow users internet access to specific sites between certain time frames or not at all) as well as bandwidth while being smart enough to know when data is network specific or internet specific
Removing IE is a rather simple task, blocking it from being installed again, that is an entirely different matter all together requiring you to disable the ability to install programs entirely. You will also have to take care with Windows Updates automatically attempting to install IE on your machine again.
I procrastinate a lot, and my Firefox have a plugin that control the time that I spend on some sites.
