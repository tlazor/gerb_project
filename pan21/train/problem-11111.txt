Simply using a Y-shaped cable is likely not to work for two reasons. The first one has already been explained in Overmind's answer. You need to know if the power bank can actually deliver 2.4A simultaneously on both ports. Not all power banks can.
However, I cannot find a portable power bank that will output that much current through a single USB port.
Then again, many kinds of non-standard implementations exist. I wouldn't risk it for a potentially expensive project. I'd recommend you get some guidance from someone that knows about electronics so that you can build a proper mobile power supply.
My project uses a barrel jack, so I would need a female USB to barrel jack cable connected to the end of the USB Y cable.
A better way to power up your project: maybe so - judging by the case, it has either 5 or 6 cells of 3000/2500 mAh. 5 or 6 cells means at least 5A continuously guaranteed. If your consumer does not need exactly 5V and can function correctly with 3 to 4.2 V, you can connect a solid cable directly to the combined cells terminals and get your high current. If you need 5V you can't bypass the internal circuit of the bank - you'll have to actually see how it is constructed (if it's case 1 or 2).
I am thinking of creating(or buying) a USB Y cable to connect both ports in parallel which would keep the voltage at 5, while adding the current together for a total of 4.8A. 
Secondly, USB devices have to communicate to the charger how much current they want to draw. Otherwise they are supposed to fall back to 500mA for USB 2.0 or 900mA for USB 3.0. This communication is done by connecting the data pins with a resistor. The resistor value tells the charger how much current the device would like to draw. The charger should support this kind of communication to actually deliver the requested current.
With multiple cells in parallel you certainly are not limited by them, but then you have the problem of how the internal circuits are designed.
