Are those backdoors built in for use by wireless contact? I don't know. It is technically feasible, it just means a bit more power drain when totally powered off. Is it universally true? Not unless there is something that breaks the rules.
With low-level software control, which NSA and other agencies can obtain via hacking or backdoors as Snowden claims, it is completely feasible (even EASY) to make the phone appear to be OFF to the owner, while still keeping a connection with the agency.  
The possibilities are endless: Just use the phones microphone to permanently "bug" the owner. Use the GPS to track where he is. Use the camera (in case the phone isn't in his pocket) to take photos of his surroundings.
Now, events that are software generated, such as a button being tapped or some such, could ping one of these lights-out devices.
There are lights-off management systems in high end servers from 9 years ago. Those systems "keep a flame burning" and when an event happened they woke up the whole system.
