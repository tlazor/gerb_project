Also, in the bottom right part of the screen when you can usually see most of the programs running in the background, like AntiVirus, wi-fi printer etc. there is only 1 icon, some weird blue logo with chinese signs as a description (according to google, it's the logo of Tencent). 
I've been asked by my parent's to help them with their computer (windows 7) today, but I'm afraid I ran out of ideas. It could be a virus, but they had the latest Kaspersky AntyVirus installed on their computer, and I'm pretty sure they weren't browsing any suspicious russian webisites in their free time.
All the other programs that should be opened after launching the pc aren't there, and what's more - the internet is also turned off, even though the router is right next to the desk.
I'm sure the system isn't completely frozen - I can see the mouse and browse through directories, but besides that, nothing works. 
I cannot open any .exe file - not only Internet browser, AntiVirus and all the other "basic" programs, but also regedit or cmd, and even Task Manager.
