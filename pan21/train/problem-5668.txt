since you only really need three lines to do serial communication (and in this case we are not using hardware flow control, which would require two extra lines), a DE-9 to stereo jack is all you need for serial communication with anything with an embedded microprocessor. 
The two cases I've used this are a serial programming cable to a TI cable modem, so you could get boot messages and command line access for firmware upgrade purposes; and a OneTouch UltraMini Glucose meter. Here the parent company will sell you an overpriced cable just so you can download your timestamped historic testing data into their "free" software app.  
I found a cable like this too, and finally figured it out that it came with my old late 1990s Olympus D-360L digital camera. It was used to transfer pictures to the computer (before card readers became common) and as I recall it would use a lot of battery transferring the pictures. 
There are some devices (like say a RAID box I have at work) that use a 3.5mm jack instead of a standard 9 pin port to access their built-in console.
Some devices (such as graphing calculators) use 3.5mm jacks to transmit data. They use similar signals to normal serial ports, but use a different connector.
