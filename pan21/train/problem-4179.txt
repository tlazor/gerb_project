Stick A is bad. I suppose it is remoteley possible that the stick component that is bad is not an actual memory chip, but some other supporting chip used for slot addressing. If that is true, you should be able to run fine with Stick A in slot 3. I encourage you to leave stick A in slot 3 and test by seeing if the original issues persist. If they do, buy a replacement for A and make note that Memtest86 has limitations.
Just because you're using Memtest86+ doesn't mean that every block of RAM is accessed and tested just most.  This means that the test with just the single stick will have a "higher" chance of more of the memory blocks being accessed and read.  With the two sticks there's a "lesser" chance.  How much higher and lesser they may be, I'm not sure.  My best suggestion is to replace memstick A and see if that changes anything.  If not then there is a possibility that the motherboards memory socket is failing, which then means replacement of the Mobo (however I doubt this).  
Finally, I'm assuming that you've done this but just in case, make sure that the motherboard memory sockets and the actual memory sticks themselves are free of any dust or debris.  You can clean them with canned air, and also rubbing alcohol (just make sure the alcohol has completely dried before seating the sticks of RAM).
