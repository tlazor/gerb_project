Your (first) command should be giving you a permanent pre-routing rule as you wanted, so long as you do not stop firewalld. I would tend to think that should be sufficient, but I may very well be missing something about your needs. 
Both approaches work the same, have the same effect, and absent other changes to your firewall policy, should be doing what you need.
tl;dr: I would just keep firewalld running, and use its commands to create and manage your rules. While the firewall-cmd vs 'raw' iptables commands have slightly different visual effects, they have the same effect on the network traffic.
If the PREROUTING is no longer working when you stop firewalld (and I am not clear why you would do that), then I would assume that is because firewalld is removing its entire policy (e.g. iptables -F/iptables -X). In which case, the fact you added another version of the same rule manually would make little difference. 
Just to be clear: there is no practical difference between having your prerouting rule in the PREROUTING_DIRECT chain or the PREROUTING chain.
The only difference is that firewalld is essentially doing a little admin behind the scenes for you, and placing your actual rule in a user-defined chain rather than a system defined one.
