My gut says that your "Information Store" service is being stopped, either because of an unhandled exception, or because something is stopping it. Watch the "System" and "Application" event logs to see if there's any evidence of the MSExchangeIS service stopping. Be sure to look at the "Services" list and see if all the Exchange-related services that are marked for "Automatic" startup are still listed as "Started".
What do you mean by "crashing"? Are you seeing one of the Exchange services stopping, or are you just making a general statement about some kind of availabilty problem?
I suspect you'll find the "Information Store" service stopped, and I suspect that re-starting it will alleviate the symptom. If that is the case, determining the root cause will require more information. One thing is certain: If the IS is crashing I'd be certain that I had good backups ASAP. The database engine behind Exchange, ESE, is a really nice and very solid database engine. If it's crashing there's probably a hardware problem or filesystem corruption on the volume hosting the database or transaction logs.
