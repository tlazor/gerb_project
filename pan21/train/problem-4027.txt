The Account Lockout Policy for domain users is defined by the settings in either the Default Domain Policy or the Default Domain Controllers Policy object.  The documentation is unclear (see here and compare to here) as to which of these contain the domain user settings by default, and does not describe how the settings for user accounts are located in non-default configurations.  It may depend upon the version of Windows Server.  In any case, we can easily avoid depending on the exact behaviour.
I don't have now domain to test, but I think that if you apply setting locally (for example via secpol.msc) you will change this only to that machine. Of course if it's not Domain Controller. 
Provided that you don't apply your GPO to the root of the domain, the Domain Controllers OU, or at the Site level, it definitely won't affect domain user accounts, even if those accounts are logging into the servers in question.  (It should be possible to apply the GPO at the root of the domain and make it work, but the details are a bit complicated so I don't recommend trying it.)
Is it possible to set an Account Lockout Threshold via Group Policy but have it only apply to local accounts on member workstations and not to domain logins?
Your member workstations should already be located in one or more OUs.  If you create a group policy object and apply it to those OUs, the Account Lockout Policy settings in that GPO will take precedence over the settings in the Default Domain Policy object (if any).  The Default Domain Controllers Policy object only applies to the Domain Controllers OU so they will not affect your member servers in any case.
