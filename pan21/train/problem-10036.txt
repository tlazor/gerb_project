A network connection (notice I didn't say adapter) may be associated with only one network profile at a time. It isn't possible for a network connection to be associated with more than one network profile simultaneously.
A firewall rule may be enabled for a specific firewall profile or for all firewall profiles, which means it will apply to connections associated with any network profile (Domain, Private, or Public).

A network connection may be associated with different network profiles depending on where it's connected. If it's connected to the domain network and the machine is domain joined then the connection will be associated with the Domain network profile and so the Domain firewall profile will be in effect. If the machine is connected to  a wifi network in a coffee shop then the connection will be associated with the Public network profile and so the Public firewall profile will be in effect. Same machine, same adapter... connected to different network types and with different network and firewall profiles. If your firewall rule is enabled for all firewall profiles then it will be in effect for all network profiles.
So the answer is a bit opposite to your question. A network connection can be associated with only one network profile, but a firewall rule may be enabled for all firewall profiles and applied to each type of network profile.
