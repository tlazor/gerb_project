If so, then your outlook was launched in safe mode. Windows released an update which causes this to happen.
Another example: I hit CTRL+ENTER to send mails. When I do this now, Outlook tells me "You have just hit CTRL+ENTER. Do you want to send the e-Mail and Outlook to remember this setting?" Then I hit yes and tick the box, so Outlook should not ask again the next time. However, when I close and reopen Outlook it does ask again. Hence, it forgot the setting (similar to the placement of the reading pane).
Now from the list, search for the following update: KB3114409 and uninstall it. Directly after you uninstalled the update, restart outlook and notice the (safe mode) is gone and everything works as expected.
Although the update was released december 8th and Microsoft already removed it, you might still somehow gotten this update.
Since a few days I observe the following behavior of my Outlook 2010: It seems to forget settings, which I define. For instance, I observed that my reading pane is gone. I then change the setting, that reading pane shall be displayed on the right hand side. When I close Outlook and reopen it, the reading pane again is gone.
