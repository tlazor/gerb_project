If you want to get fancy you can research the three different technologies I mentioned above. But, primarily you’ll want the Windows 10 ADK. With tools it provides you’ll be able to capture and deploy images, customize your deployment with unattend files, inject drivers and updates to an offline Windows image, create a WinPE environment, etc.
The possibilities are endless. It’s really quite amazing some of the technology Microsoft builds in to Windows that most people don’t even know exists.
Your desired approach is not impossible, but extremely difficult: on installation, Windows makes itself comfortable for the chipset and capabilities of your motherboard and other non-Plug and Play hardware, the details of which remain undocumented.
Although there is a large amount of customization and automation you can do using the Windows 10 ADK, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, and Windows Deployment Services, the most simple method for your needs should be this:
If you make drastic changes to this hardware, especially by moving from virtual hardware to physical hardware, it is very likely that Windows will not have the right drivers available or registry settings set correctly to start the system cleanly.
For future maintenance of the VM, first rollback to the snapshot you made. Then you can install updates and do any other maintenance. Then do steps 3 through 6 again.
However, you can still use tools designed for making images for quick installs, as this is done routinely in enterprises. See Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer, Microsoft's provisioning tool for Windows 10.
Each version of Windows gets even more flexible and easier to do this with. Windows 10 is extremely easy to image and deploy because of its vast array of drivers and automatic download of drivers it needs.
The simple answer to your question is, yes. What you suggest doing is done all the time, but typically on a larger scale and utilizing some different technologies to make life easier.
