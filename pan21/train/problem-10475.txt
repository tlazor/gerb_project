this is especially useful if you have proxy filtering traffic [ and eg preventing attempts to tunnel ssh over port 80 ]. 
If I understand what you are asking, you can do this with source and destination NAT for iptables as well.  This link explains the iptables commands.
or you can setup mod-proxy on apache and forward traffic to many different sites [ radio stations ? ] - as long as they use http to steram music.
You can create it from your client machine if you can ssh to your VPS. Otherwise, you can just do a tunnel on the VPS and keep it alive before you go to work. Make sure you allow it to "Accept connections from other hosts"
then - at the office - you just turn on your music player and listen to http://your.vps/radio1/a.ogg or http://your.vps/radio4/ etc
Forward your VPS port 80 to destination port 8080. Then when you connect to port 80 on your VPS it's as if you had connected directly to the destination.
By far the easiest way is to set up xinetd or similar to 'redirect' all your connections. You won't need to touch your web-server that way. Do something like this for xinetd.
