When the cost of switching to a dedicated server is lower than that of optimizing the code to get the required performance on your current system (when you have reached the limit of your hardware, it goes to infinity).
As far as the dedicated vs VPS, it all depends on your application.  If you find yourself using most of the resources allocated, or need ridiculous specs, then moving dedicated may be cheaper in the long run.  But there's no easy calculator that says "input X, Y, Z and we'll tell you which to go with".  It's a judgment call that takes experience to make.  Personally, I like to err on the side of less expensive (it's easier to throw more money if you need it, but it's harder to scale back)...
I suggest you contact a hosting company that provides both options. Before signing up, discuss this with them and in particular discuss migrating from VPS to dedicated. If they are unable or unwilling to help simply move on to the next one.
On paper, storage is one thing you can judge on; storage in VPSs (in my experience) tends to get expensive past, often being cheaper per gb. on some dedicated servers on the same provider.
There should be no reason why you can't start with a VPS and move to dedicated if/when the need arises.
People often comment on lousy disk performance on VPSs. My extra low end VPS's disk, according to hdparm is nearly 9x slower than the hard drive in my 5-year old Thinkpad...
