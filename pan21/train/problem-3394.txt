I have noticed if you delete the policy from GPM they will never go away. You have to do it by the right steps or re-image the computer to remove the policies. 
Remove workstation from the domain. Go to C:\Windows\security\database and rename file edb.chk to edb.old. Run a gpupdate /force three times and restart workstation. When done reconnect to domain and test.
It is a win7 ultimate x64 machine. The machine was in a domain where it got those group policy settings. Now it has left the domain but it still receives the settings from the group policy. For example, the power options. I set a certain power option but soon it will be reset to another power option which is endorsed by the domain.
The system was PHYSICALLY removed from the domain? Has it been removed via the OS yet? Basically, does the system know it's not on the domain? If you are still logging into an account that was used while it was on the domain, chances are it hasnt been removed from the domain. Group policy will apply if it is a domain account, regardless of physical connection to the network that the domain resides on. Try logging in as the local administrator and see if that alleviates the problem. If it does, you need to disjoin the machine from the domain through the computer name tab in the advanced system settings and stop using the domain level account to log in.
If it is physically off the domain, and you ARE using a local account to log on, and it still carries the group policy settings, not only would i be very surprised, but something is wrong.
I have seen this but on my domain. I have computers that I've moved out of OU's that still keep OU's GPO's. I've moved them back into the OU and removed the check from Enforce and Link Enable. This helped remove the policy.
