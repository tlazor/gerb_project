You are running a pre-release of a Windows OS, so there will be bugs. I don't believe anyone can answer your question with any certainty.
As has been pointed out, you installed a Beta version of Windows 8.  You are expected to be able to troubleshoot your own issues, as well as report them to Microsoft when possible to assist them in being able to resolve these issues for others.  Feel free to read the Windows 8 FAQ for more information.
I downloaded Release Preview and installed it. I have a problem when I shut down the computer. After I press windows key + I > Power > Shut Down, a box pops up titled "Winlogon.exe - No Disk. Then under that is the message "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into Drive G". After hitting the retry button a couple of different times the screen finally goes dark. When I was going to turn it back on, I noticed the Power Button was still list. The only way to do a complete Shutdown is to hold in the power button directly.
