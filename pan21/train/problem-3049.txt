However, if your drive is showing significant numbers of bad sectors (which I assume it is, if Windows can't see it..), it's probably better, and definitely safer, to spare yourself the misery of backup restoration later on and go get a new drive.
If you really still insist on hurling caution into the wind, there are some hazardous tricks you can do with hdparm's --write-sector option, which can force a firmware-level remap by writing all zeroes to some busted block.
Failing that, another month or so of bad-block checking mkfs might be the only way to get it working again, and you'd better hope no new bad blocks come up later on (which is probably likely)
If your drive is showing bad blocks, it's probably, for all intents and purposes, borderline paperweight-status. 
All modern drives (and their billions of sectors) will have some inevitable faults, which is why all drive manufacturers provide a sizable chunk of unused sectors for drives to do a firmware-level remapping to in the event of one or two coming up bad. You can use smartctl under Linux to take a peek at this, and run other online and offline integrity tests. smartctl --all /dev/whatever will spit out tons of diagnostic info, and smartctl --help gives all sorts of info on the many test types.
