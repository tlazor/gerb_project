For outage detection, things get a little more tricky as 'Internet' isn't really that 'big homogeneous network' everybody seems to think it is. Your route toward a single IP depend on your upstream and all the peer along the way. Normally, a outage should be automatically detected and 'next available peer' used, but... 
Reverse-DNS to gather the 'owner' of an IP really isn't the way to go. The reverse tables are most often not updated by IPs provider and doesn't provide much in term of diagnostic. (This is different in the email world - as filtering rules are often added to determine the validity of reverse lookup).
For more in depth investigation, I like ROBTEX (http://www.robtex.com). It shows you the owner (as per their own database) along with its registered peers and AS numbers (required for BGP).
To get the 'block owner', you should go to the attribution authority. RIPE is only 1 of 5 Regional Internet Registry (RIR). AfriNIC, ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC are the others one. Their WHOIS tables are SUPPOSED to be up-to-date and give you the official owner & some contact informations.
The easiest way to detect that kind of problems would be to use "Looking Glasses" (such as http://www.bgp4.as/looking-glasses) to see if you are the only one having problem to route traffic toward that target network.
