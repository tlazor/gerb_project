I don't know of a tool that does exactly what you are looking for, but I have played around with MusicIP.  
Used the linux / java version - it takes a long time to completely analyze a music library, but it really does work.  You can find songs that are similar to other songs.  You can right click on the playlist generated and select option to select more or fewer songs like the one selected.  You can also choose to eliminate certain genre's.  It's kind of cool, but after the wow factor wore off, I stopped using it.
However I've not found any beat-detection software that could have helped me. Have you ever used one? CLI, preferably. Also I'm interested if there's anything alike for tagging FLACs with the same 'bpm' field.
Amarok 2 can search through music collection using ID3v2 tag's 'bpm' field. That would be very nice to retag the entire music collection so I can find the 'mood' of the track I like.
I used kolypto's original script using bpmcount and rewrote it for bpm-tag (utility of bpm-tools) which I had better luck with installing. I also made some improvements of my own.
