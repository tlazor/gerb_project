I'm logged in with the same Chrome account at two laptops sitting next to each other. Often I want to transfer tabs/windows from one to the other. I could copy&paste the URLs to a .txt file, then use Homegroup sharing to access that .txt from the other PC and copy&paste the URLs into the browser there, but that's inconvenient.
You can create a shared folder, attach that as a toolbar on the taskbar for both laptops, and then you can drag the tab into the taskbar folder, which will create a shortcut with the URL, and then you can drag it from the taskbar to chrome. Delete the shortcut afterwards to keep things tidy.
1 If you only use Chrome on both devices, and do not need to transfer tabs from Chrome to another browser, then TabCloud could work. Also if you are connected to your google account on both Chrome browsers you may be able to see the tabs opened on other devices via the chrome menu>History (Source)
If you are running two computers side-by-side, I strongly suggest using Synergy. This will let you use one mouse and keyboard to control both computers (just move the pointer to the other screen to switch control). There is a shared clipboard and other nice features. Then the problem you describe, and many others, simply disappear. You just copy the url and paste it into the browser on the other computer.
