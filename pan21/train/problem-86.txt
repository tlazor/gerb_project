Suppose I'm using Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (2010 or 2012, it works the same way) to backup, amongst various other things, my Active Directory environment (as in "the System State of my domain controllers").
How can I restore my Active Directory environment starting with only new servers and DPM tape backups?
Then, a complete data center lost occurs. I have to start fresh on new hardware, I only have my tape backups available because they were stored off-site. So I buy some new servers, a new tape library, new storage, and so on.
N.B. Using virtual domain controllers and backing up the full VMs could make the restore easier, but actually doesn't change the question at all: a working AD environment is still needed in order to even install DPM.
This solution is clumsy, long and somewhat awkward, but it should work; my only concern is about restoring the DPM database for the first time (the step marked with (*) in the list), because I don't know if this could work when running on a different AD domain. If this doesn't work, then the only solution would be manually importing the tape containing the system state backup of a DC... and good luck finding it if you have decent-sized backups.
So far, I've been able to come up with the following procedure, but I really hope there is some simpler way:
Howewer, and here's the catch, DPM needs Active Directory in order work; it won't even install on a standalone server. But, of course, a working DPM server is needed in order to get back those backups from the tapes.
Now, everyone knows (or should know) that in order to perform an Active Directory disaster recovery I need to at least restore the system state of a domain controller; of course, this can get... tricky if I need to restore it on different hardware from the original server, but let's also assume this point is covered.
