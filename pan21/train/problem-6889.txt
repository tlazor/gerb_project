Look up Dynamic Disks and Spanned Volumes in Disk Management help. This should allow you to do what you need; I don't know the details, though. 
Windows (now) can mount volumes into folders instead of drive letters, just like UNIX does. Each folder then corresponds to a separate drive.
RAID0 is what you're looking for in this scenario, though you may need a hardware RAID controller to make it all work.  In that setup the RAID controller would take all of the disks and turn them into a single logical drive that the operating system would see.  The entire thing becomes one large block of space.  The problem is that if one of the member drives in the array fails, the entire array fails and becomes inaccessible.  I've seen people use RAID0 arrays for doing temporary work such as video editing and the like, but never for long-term storage because of the dangers involved.  Tread with caution if you take this road.
One option is to set them as RAID 0. Being all of the same size, this means the final volume will be 4 x minimum size, or 4 x 1TB.
As Zoredache says, you'd be safer with a RAID5 volume (which I think can also be set up using dynamic disks) -- but as always, RAID is not a backup!
