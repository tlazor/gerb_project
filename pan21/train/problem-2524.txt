If you want a trusted cert the domain must belong to your organization. It wouldn't "interfere" with some other site, but it's a security issue for everyone else on that domain. I don't think any reputable provider will allow you a wildcard cert for a domain without a valid WHOIS, or at least something on company letterhead that says that you own the domain.
Yes, but you will need to transfer your Private Key to all the other servers as well. How to do this depends on your OS and web server of choice.
I have a suspicion you might be using a service like freedns.afraid.org. Getting a wildcard certificate when using a service like that could prove logisitcally difficult.
Yes. A wildcard certificate that is installed on your servers and bound to your sites will not interfere with anyone elses subdomains, however anyone else could actually do the same thing (get their own wildcard for that domain) and imitate your site without anyone knowing.
The one question you haven't asked that I will answer for you though, is can you even GET this certificate. Sure, if you can get it, it will work, but when you purchase SSL certificates, the most simplest form of validation is them sending an email to a fixed email address on the domain (e.g. admin@example.com) - they will give you a selection of email addresses to choose from, but if you don't own the parent domain you will at least require their co-opreating to get your copy of the certificate.
