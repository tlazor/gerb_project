Now: Every other wifi I connect to is working. School, work, public hotspots. Perfectly working, down- and upload. 
I have brand new acer Aspire V15 Nitro, instantly after opening it, I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. 
I am more than sure that something is wrong with my router, but the logs say everything is fine (no errors, no warnings). I just wanted to ask, if anybody has ever encountered a problem like that, and if anybody could help me with that.
And the other thing is: Every other device that is connected to my home wifi router is working with down- and upload perfectly (LAN or WiFi, it works). Only my laptop doesn't work over wifi, but it works over LAN of the same router. 
Don't get me wrong, there is still a little bit upload left, so I can surf without noticing too much, but when I really want to upload, it fails. Even speedtests fail when it comes to upload, they just endlessly try to load.
- Router: Fritzbox 7390 (default from provider, due to that I don't have the possibility to update the routers firmware)
Connecting to home WiFi functioned very well. It is just recently (the first time I ever wanted upload) when I wanted to send an email and it took ages to send. And when sending emails with attachment it was way too long. I never waited until it was sent and cancelled it after 45 min of waiting (just so you have an image).
