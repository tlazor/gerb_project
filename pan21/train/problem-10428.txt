Although this isn't as straightforward in Word as it is in something like Adobe FrameMaker (which has conditional text functionality), it can be done. Here are the 2 approaches that I've used (or partially used) in the past. There may be others.
Especially if the differences are at the level of whole sentences, paragraphs, or sections, or if other character styles need to be applied in the text that changes, you can save the variant blocks of text as groups of Quick Parts. You can then insert a Building Block Gallery Content Control (available on the Developer tab) at each location where the text needs to vary, and assign the appropriate group (gallery/category) of variants to that control. 
Presumably, you could also record a macro or write code that would automatically select all the 'Version 1', 'Version 2', or 'Version 3' text variants in the whole document, and save the output in the desired file format; but I've never tried to do that.
In both cases, I think you'll want to save your base document as a (macro-enabled) Word template, which you'll then use to generate the three final versions.
You can then just select the appropriate variant for each block of text in a drop-down menu. I recently used this approach in a template that's used for various document types, each of which requires slightly different copyright text.
Needless to say, this approach would be a bit of a pain (though if you're not familiar with the controls used in method B, it's probably the better choice). In addition, because Word allows only 1 named character style at a time to applied to a given bit of text, if other character styles need to be applied to the text that will be hidden in some versions, you'll lose those styles when you apply the various version-specific styles.
