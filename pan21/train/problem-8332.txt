VMware suggests to still use 512n disks as they have the highest performance due to no need for emulation and the fact that 4kn is not supported even by VMware ESXi 6.0 yet:
An option, if you would like to try it, is to add two of the disks (one from each side of the R0) from your RAID10 on the 6405 to the 71605. The new card should pick up the configuration from just these two disks alone. Boot into a Linux live cd to check the disk stats. If this upgrade doesn't work, then you can easily revert back to the old controller with no harm done. If it does work, then you can just plug the other two disks from the old controller in, and you will be good to go.

Thank you for this great post which I have found by accident searching for the most reliable hdd solution for VMware environment and understanding the differences between 512n, 512e and 4kn.
Conclusion: For a maximum performance on VMware ESXi systems using direct attached storage I recommend to use 512 native formatted hard drives. I will first start using 4kn disks when my adaptec raid controllers as well the operating systems are capable to communicate with 4kn without any emulation.
I'm not sure if it is possible, but if necessary, you may be able to create an array with missing members from the command line on the new card, so that you can create the 4 disk RAID10 with just the two disks you were testing. Then you could sync from card to card. Maybe not though.
You should be able to plug the disks into any Adaptec controller and it will pick up the configuration from the previous controller, so there is no harm in trying this out. However, I believe that the configuration of sector size is integrated very closely with the RAID configuration, and you will also have the partitions to contend with.
