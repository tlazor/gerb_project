If you want to install syslinux bootloader for ISO files which are not meant to target USB drives, use -b option:
For Windows-based bootable USB drives, you'll need to add the bootmgr compatible code with bootsect.exe, then you can simply copy an entire Windows CD/DVD to the USB drive. Guide for Windows 7 found here.
Some ISO images already have the appropriate boot sector; for example, Arch Linux ISOs. In this case, all you need is to write the image using dd ... of=/dev/sda or similar. (Using a partition, sda1, will not work.)
Open the folder /run/media/<YOUR_USER>/<ISO_NAME> and copy all ISO files to the USB drive (pendrive) including the hidden ones.
IMPORTANT I: In order for the USB drive (pendrive) be bootable the ISO needs to be bootable. Use the same reasoning for UEFI ("BOOT/UEFI") compatibility.
IMPORTANT II: If the ISO is not compatible with UEFI ("BOOT/UEFI") method it may be necessary to enable the "Launch CSM", disabling "Secure Boot Option" and enabling some other legacy suports on machine bios.
It will also autodetect USB device if there is exactly one USB drive connected to your system, see it in action:
But if the ISO image is not specially prepared to be used from a USB drive, you will have to copy the .iso file to the disk as an ordinary file – mount, cp, all that – and install a bootloader such as Syslinux or lilo or GRUB. (There already are several pages on the Internet on this topic.)
For Linux Live USB drives, I'd recommend using Pen Drive Linux. They tell you how to make pretty much every distribution bootable from a pen drive, and they link you to the tools needed. 
bootiso will check that selected device /dev/sdd is connected through USB and fails if it doesn't, which is a big security plus.
