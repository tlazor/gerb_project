There is a straightforward way to do this with formulas.  Let me point out that the example shows cases that only involve matches that include the first column.  Any formula should be tested against an example that contains random matches.
I'll explain this in two parts since the number of columns can vary.  The first part is an expression that you build for the required number of columns.  I've added a column of data to illustrate the formula better, and included some cases with random matches:
If N is the number of data columns, the formula contains N-1 terms.  The first term counts how many columns have values that equal the first.  The second counts how many of the remaining columns equal the second.  And so on.  They can all be COUNTIFs but I've used as simpler term for the last case.  Instead of counting one column, I just test whether the next to last equals the last.  A result of True is recognized as a value of 1, False as a value of 0.  If all of the values are unique, this expression will equal 0.  Otherwise, it will be a higher number.  The expression goes inside an IF test:
