-Also, Pokemon has attacks with secondary effects. Consider how you want to weight an attack that does more damage versus a weaker attack with a chance to stun or that always goes first.
Generalized AI with modular components will probably result in smaller code, and will be easier to expand for a larger number of characters. Here are some example considerations, assuming you construct a generic weighting system for all characters.
-You could assign each character a 'personality' or 'attitude' from a set list (e.g. 'Aggressive', 'Defensive', 'Random'). Then, have your weighting formula take that into account. So, say, an Aggressive character would give more weight to damaging moves, while a Defensive character would give more weight to healing himself. Then, you only have to assign the personality to each character rather than writing unique scripts for each.
-Instead of always choosing the 'best' option, your AI can weight each option, then randomly decide between them. So, given 4 moves, if their calculated values come out to 60, 35, 25, and 20 in this turn, that adds up to 140. Pick a random number in the range 1 to 140, and check against the weights to decide which move is used. This will make the AI usually use the best move, but often surprise you with an alternate choice.
-Remember that Pokemon has a LOT of moves that do not do damage directly, but instead apply status effects, buffs, or debuffs. You can give each character a numeric preference for damaging versus non-damaging moves. You could also give them a set number or possible range of non-damaging moves that they will use before starting to attack directly. Current self and opponent HP values could also be a factor in the formula to weight attacking versus using strategic moves - when you're both at full health, you've got time to set up, but when it's down to a sliver of HP each, it's time to use an attack (hopefully one that hits first!).
-You can give each AI character a numeric "skill" rating that is used to scale the chances that they will pick the best move.
