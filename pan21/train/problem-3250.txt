The minimum Ethernet frame size was defined for the original, half-duplex variants. With half duplex, you need to reliably detect and propagate collisions while they happen. A signal needs to propagate over the longest distance between two stations in a segment, allow collision detection, and propagate the jamming signal back to the sender while it is still transmitting. Putting everything together, you end up with 512 bits or 64 bytes in a frame.
However, there's much confusion about these details and much is quoted wrong. The reference is IEEE 802.3 Clause 4.4.2 MAC parameters.
Switched, full-duplex Ethernet makes these considerations obsolete. However, Ethernet is built on compatibility - all physical layer variants can coexist and interact with each other. So, the minimum frame size was never changed and an ancient 10 Mbit/s half-duplex node can still work in a modern multi-gigabit network without much ado.
Gigabit Ethernet initially included a half-duplex mode, requiring padding to increase the minimum Ethernet packet size (not the frame size). Half-duplex GbE wasn't actually used anywhere and is obsolete now.
For Fast Ethernet (100 Mbit/s), the inherently, half-duplex coax cable was abandoned and only full-duplex capable media are used (=media with dedicated signal paths per direction). This speeds up collision detection considerably and allows to use the same minimum frame size even though a frame over Fast Ethernet is much shorter in time.
