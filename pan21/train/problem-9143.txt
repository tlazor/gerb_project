It really depends on your application, check if it supports unattended installation or silent installation, then you may use suitable command line parameters to install.
It depends on the applications being installed, some installers just don't support silent installs or even actively prohibits them. 
If silent installs is possible you can use most installer makers. This seems like a good resource on sourceforge.
also you can use Auto-it to make an auto installer script for most of the applications and it's quite easy and suited.
For silent installs - as others mentioned - you would need to ensure that you package silent versions of the programs you are planning to deploy.
Windows has a built-in installer creator that can bundle multiple executables located at %SYSTEMROOT%\system32\iexpress.exe
You'll want the redistributable version of the Adobe AIR installer (this version is optimised to allow silent/unattended installs, and doesn't include any bundled bloatware or toolbars). Get it from http://www.adobe.com/products/air/runtime_distribution1.html
