IE I have a node C which is able to ping B and D. It is my understanding that if I send a multicast packet to a certain address/port that all nodes within the transmission range of the node which sent the packet should at least have a chance of receiving the packet. What I'm not sure of is whether that packet also gets forwarded.
If I set the TTL to 1 and send a multicast packet from node C, the packet should reach B and D because they are within the broadcast range of C.What I'm wondering is if nodes A and E receive the packet as well? Or will the packet not be forwarded to them?
So I have an ad-hoc network made of 5 nodes. Assume that each node has a physical broadcast range of 1 arrow (nearest neighbor)
I'm using some raspberry pi's which are using the linux rtl8192cu driver in ad-hoc mode and I'm wondering whether or not they would be propagate the multicast packets to other nodes within the network if they are all on the same subnet (due to physical constraints some of the radios are not within each others transmission radius).
