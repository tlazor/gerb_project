Its obviously removed several modules but not all of them. I tried to stop the vzlmond service and manually remove a couple without any luck. 
Out of curiosity I ran /etc/init.d/vz status and it reported vz was still running even though it reported it successfully stopped in the previous step. I took a look at the init script and found the command that it uses to test if it was running or not. I thought perhaps there was a pid file that was not being deleted or something along those lines but that was not the case. It checks for vzmon in /proc/modules and if anything returns it reports as running. 
The update process finished downloading the packages it needed but as soon as it tries to install them it fails with a message about not being able to stop Virtuozzo. I manually stopped vz using /etc/init.d/vz stop and it claimed to have successfully shutdown. I then re-ran the vzup2date process and it failed at the same point with the same error even though Virtuozzo is stopped. 
I tried to prevent vz from booting with the system using chkconfig vz off and rebooting. Regardless vz was still running after a reboot of the hardware node. I stopped vz manually again and tried to re run vzup2date to perform the upgrade and it failed with the same error. 
I have some servers that are running Virtuozzo 3.x on them still. This is VERY old and starting to cause some serious problems. The machines are leased machines in a datacenter in TX while I am in WI so I am trying to upgrade with vzup2date.
