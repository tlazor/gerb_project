My script has not found any 3rd party access by now, but we had a user last week asking if he could use a smart inbox and GTD tool. So at least we have some awareness, and well behaved users. But I am afraid that at some point people will start using suspicious stuff.
Since we are in the EU, and thus hit by GDPR, and we consider e-mails as containing personal data, then we can not legally allow 3rd parties access to users e-mail without a data processor agreement, risk assessment etc in place. The 3rd party would process data.
I know that we tend to have wishes way forward of the leading edge, or vendors just being incredible slow to implement sensible features.
We can disallow all 3rd party apps, by tuning integrated Apps off. But we still would allow the user to grant simple consent like: "openid profile email", "User.Read openid email profile offline_access"  or "User.Read"
We can get the granted permissions on a per user basis, and do our own reporting and followup. But it would be better to say users can NOT give 3rd party apps any sort of e-mail, calendar and Contacts (that is by definition personal data) permission. 
I am currently running a report, extracting info on what people has already granted consent to, so I have some data to justify the disabling user content completely (if that is possible). But for my 75k identities in AAD (not all with a license) it takes some time.
