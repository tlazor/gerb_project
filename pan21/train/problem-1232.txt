If you're seeing it run for 30 minutes, it's so tempting to say that it's probably the Windows Defender service... Are you certain it's not still running? Consider checking Task Manager - see what's using up the largest percentage of CPU or Disk resources durning that time and that will likely give you the culprit. 
There are a good number of tasks that can be run as part of auto maintenance in Windows 8.1, the most common being malware protection scans/updates, and disk optimization. 
Anyway, when it runs, take a look at what processes your machine is currently running (consuming most of the CPU/RAM). This usually leads to a good indication of what the automatic maintenance is doing.
And while that is a decent PC build, keep in mind that any of those components can still become the performance bottleneck during some lengthy job.
Auto maintenance is intended to be something that runs without you ever even needing to take any notice of it; if it's catching your eye, you might just consider changing the settings so that it runs at a different time of day when you don't typically utilize the system, and just let it do its thing. 
It runs defrag (useless on SSDs - it uses trim instead), anti-malware (nearly useless), checks some of it's .dll files (useless since they are alter-protected and mirrored) and searches for registry/configuration conflicts (finally something good), optimizes  .NET-related stuff, digs into error reports.
Given that you're running with an Intel SSD, no defragmentation takes place during disk optimization - only TRIM (SSD write performance optimization, typically completes in less than 1 minute on a drive of that size).
