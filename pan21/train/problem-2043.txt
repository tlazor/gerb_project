And what screwdriver would be the most apt for the work? I see that a common household Phillips screwdriver just fits, but wonder whether it would be better to use a JIS or Pozidrive? What tool would do the cleaner job? 
When doing some maintenance work on a Lenovo Thinkpad (like installing RAM), the  manual instructions recommend using new screws. Is that so important?
And yes, it's a shame that you can't change memory or the harddrive by just removing one or two screws. Thank you Lenovo!
My particular laptop does not have a service bay to replace HDD or RAM, you just have to pry open the whole back part. So I assume I'll could be opening it for new HDD soon, then new RAM sometime, new battery,  clean the fan. 
Just be careful when you have to fiddle with these plastic clips. I tend to use those cell phone / ipod opening tools which are also made of plastic. Well, if don't use my fingernails...
You don't need to buy a new screw kit if you don't lose any screws and if you have a screwdriver that is in good shape. I have a Phillips Wiha PH0 x 50 mm that fits most of my Thinkpad screws (X250, T420, X61).
If I decide to use new screws, what screws exactly should I use? Lenovo does not offer 'official screws'.
