I am very to new to .NET projects and I am wondering which is the best tool to store binaries of .NET project. How good to store binaries of .NET projects in artifactory and why? can some one answer generally Any comments can be helpful.
There are multiple options in terms of package management. The 2 largest are jFrog Artifactory and Sonatype Nexus. Both offer support for multiple formats such as maven, NuGet, Docker, npm, ...
If you only have standard requirements, both of these will suffice. If you have specific requirements, it's best to look at a comparison such as this one to find out which one has got what you need.
I'd recommend ProGet. If you're familiar with Artifactory you might find this comparison helpful: https://inedo.com/support/kb/1115/a-comparison-artifactory-vs-proget 
When it comes to choosing one: If you have experience with one, i would suggest taking that one. Otherwise, you can't really go wrong with either one, since both are widely used by small and large teams around the world.
