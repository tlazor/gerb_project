I think you've done a good job identifying the trade-offs in this situation.  If you impute missing values before visualization, then you won't be visualizing the "true" data.  But sometimes a lot of data is missing, and if you drop all examples with missing attributes then you're unlikely to be visualizing a representative sample of the data you might use to train a model, or, worse, you might miss out on some important insights because so much data is missing.
That's correct. Think of it this way: if the percentage of missing values is too high, then you have no basis on which to accurately fill the missing values. You might just be inventing too much data. How will that play later? Are you adding something valuable, or are you putting in too much invention on your own just to save that one attribute? 
Maybe there's a way you can get the best of both worlds?  I would recommend imputing missing values before visualization, but marking them visually.  For example, you might generate a plot where examples with no missing data are colored green, examples with one missing field are yellow, and examples with 2+ missing fields are red.
I think there's a crucial detail to answer here which might deepen your analysis a bit. How are you planning to imput the missing values? That might well depend on two things:
