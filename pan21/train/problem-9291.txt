I've got the reverse proxy working and I can successfully send requests matching example.com/site/folder/ over to site-internal.example.com/folder/ 
On server.example.com I added the pre-configured URL rewrite rule to append the trailing slash for me --- but when I enable this rule it seems to be too broad. Although it fixes the 404 errors and forces the client from folder to folder/ before it is proxied, the rule also adds a / to regular requests (ie. example.com/site/images/test.jpg becomes example.com/site/images/test.jpg/) This causes a 404 at the VM level because there is no file that matchines test.jpg/
I'm trying to setup a reverse proxy for my website. Basically, I have an external site example.com/site/folder that needs to reverse proxy to some internal VMs. Here's a little background
Any thoughts on how to get around this? I'd prefer to make all changes at the host machine level (rather than the VMs) -- but if I absolutely have to change the VMs I can do that. 
However I'm having problems with 301 redirects that are returned by the internal VMs. When the user goes to http://example.com/site/folder without the trailing slash, the internal VM shoots back a redirect to go to folder/. This causes a 404 at the host machine level because example.com/folder/ does not exist.
