If there are unmanaged switches on your network that you would like to keep but protect STP and prevent loops you could enable a feature called root guard. This would allow that port to still receive bpdu packets, but it would not forward those that try to alter STP.
If you want to be more proactive, you can consider configuring SNMP traps for spanning-tree and storm control events. Your switches can then send trap messages to a central SNMP trap server when a loop occurs.This SNMP trap server can then send you an alert (via mail, SMS, IRC, or whatever you have in place). 
The level here indicates the percentage of the total interface bandwidth which can be used for broadcast/multicast/unknown unicast traffic. You can then set an action on what happens when this level is exceeded:
The best solution would be to block unmanaged switches entirely, except those that you explicitly allow. This can be done by enabling bpduguard on access ports, which would disable any port that receives a bpdu packet.
Typically, an unmanaged switch wouldn't send BPDU's, since it won't support spanning-tree. So you can only see your own BPDU's coming back to you on another port then. If you're running spanning-tree, you can use a BPDU guard on Cisco to stop the loop by shutting down the interface:
Another way to monitor and prevent them is by implementing storm control, which can help you to detect and stop broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast floods.
Method 1: View the MAC address table, if you see multiple machines connecting on a single port, that is a pretty good indication that their is a switch connected to that port.
