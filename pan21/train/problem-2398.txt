The latest version is Emacs 23, version 22 does work on i386 of course, but it may be an issue with the packaging system which hasn't been fixed because everyone installs 23 instead. Is their a reason you can't install emacs 23?  
Then switch to the "Other Software" tab. Temporarily disable everything here, but make sure to not which ones are checked.
Which ever repository your Ubuntu install is pulling Emacs from is provding the x86_64 version (well, that's what is sounds like).
If you're a heavy EMACS user you might try ensuring you have an emacs-free environment when you do these things.  I.e. don't do the upgrade in a shell inside an emacs buffer... and in general make sure EMACS isn't running while you're doing the upgrade.
Bizarre.  The problem is not your computer type, since Ubuntu Emacs 22 is installed on thousands of i386 machines (including mine).  Try installing the package emacs-snapshot.  It's the latest dev version of Emacs 23.  This is just a shot in the dark, though.  My guess is that you may want to upgrade (or even reinstall) Ubuntu when the next version comes out (Oct 29--- a week away), since I suspect that installing Emacs may not be your only problem!
Did that work? I'm really guessing here. The only time I've seen the same or nearly same error was when trying to install a 64bit package on a 32bit machine. Normally I run only 64 bit workstations and server, so I don't see this often.
