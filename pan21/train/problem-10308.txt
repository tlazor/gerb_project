Remarks: Notice that I parse the number of characters after the decimal point as inputted by the user. I think this is inefficient since I must store another int inside the class. This is slower and increases the size of the binary file. I want to be able to serialize and deserialize this object as fast as possible. I will eventually extend this to parse millions of objects. My professor told me that the location (i.e. XXX-XXX) should not be written as ASCII. How could the task be accomplished without writing the location to ASCII? 
For example, suppose the user imputed the building object: age = 45, location = "345-789", quality = "2.3829. 
Goal: Serialize the object into a binary format and then deserialize the object to display (on console) the exact same building info as inputed by the user.
Attempt: Although my application works exactly as specified by the goal, I believe there are major inefficiencies in my code. I am asking for feedback directly related to efficiency. Does there exist a more efficient method to accomplish the same goal? This project is for educational purposes and I cannot use any serialization libraries.
