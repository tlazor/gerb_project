I'm currently in a three floor apartment where we share the internet with the two units below us. The WNDR3700 worked fine for this. I have a cheaper older router plugged in now and it is struggling. We will probably be moving to a house next year and I want the ability to add extra access points so I can saturate the wireless signal. I like the idea of having individual components so later on I can upgrade the AP to 802.11ac or whatever the current standard is and still keep all the other hardware. We have the usual wireless devices (laptops, phones, tablet) and I also have a PS3 and a QNAP NAS that I connect via wired ethernet. 
While I'm fairly tech savvy, I'm new to this level of the networking, but I want to learn more about it. Thanks!
I was thinking I need to get a router, switch, and a wireless access point (and a second AP in the future). Ubiquiti seems to be pretty good from what I've read online other than some difficulty with initial setup. I assume it's better, but not required, to have all the components be the same brand? Would I plug everything into the switch and then just one cable from the switch to the router?
I've gone through too many consumer routers (most recently it seems that a capacitor failed on my Netgear WNDR3700) and a friend suggested I look into Ubiquiti.
