What I usually do is this: On the image resize screen, I first copy the width of the amount of pixels I already have, then I change the DPI setting. The width changes. I paste back the old value, and now the CM measures change. I hit OK. The image dimensions change, but the amount of pixels stay the same. And the DPI has also changed.
You usually set this at the document resize screen. You can choose to change the DPI setting but keep the resolution in pixels the same. You may have to calculate what the width and height will become in CM using the new DPI setting for it to scale properly, but it will keep all the pixels the same.
Also note, that if you keep the amount of pixels the same, and you increase the DPI, the physical size becomes smaller. The image will be sharper when printed, but also smaller. If you decrease the DPI, the physical dimensions increase, but the image becomes pixellated.
The applications that can actually deal with DPI settings should allow you to specify the DPI when it converts.
That said, do note that if you don't alter the DPI setting in anyway and not resize the image, the same scaling automatically happen when you print out the image.
