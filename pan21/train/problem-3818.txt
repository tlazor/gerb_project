This is actually less good than without BPDU guard as in that case, the port would not be shut down but just in a blocking state, continuously looking for the flow of BPDUs to cease (meaning the loop had gone) without any periodic re-enablement to full forwarding that causes temporary storms.
Initially there is no difference in the outcome: the loop is suppressed. However, when the timer auto reactivates the port, the physical loop may still actually be present and there will be a < 2 second broadcast storm in the network until the next BPDU is seen causing the port to shut down again. When this occurs repeatedly at the configured interval, it starts to be noticeable by users as intermittent poor network performance. 
(I actually have this issue on an HP network but will use Cisco terminology since I think more people are familiar with that)
A side effect of this approach is that in the event that there is no rogue switch but a port is looped back to another on the same switch (or another in the same VLAN) by a careless user, the switch sees its own BPDUs and errdisables the port under BPDU Guard rather than using a conventional STP blocking state.
We also have a timer set to automatically re-enable ports that have been shut down by BPDU Guard after a suitable time, (errdisable recovery cause bpduguard, errdisable recovery interval 1800), so that ports can be automatically reactivated after the rogue device hopefully goes away.
