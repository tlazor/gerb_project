If you have the interfaces available, a physical DMZ for managing that switch would be the safest option. (consider the effects of typos, misconfigurations, stray cables, and hackers -- but that's a question for the security SE)
Since the management IP of the managed switch has to be in the same subnet, I can only assign a WAN IP as the management IP of this switch. That means anybody can access this switch if I assign the IP, with password being the only defense.
I never keep a managed switch outside the firewall. However, I have a situation where I have to do that. I am connecting two Sonicwall NSA220 in HA configuration. So I have to use a small Ethernet switch in front of the firewall to connect the WAN cable to X1 port of both primary and slave firewall. I have ordered a pair of NETGEAR ProSAFE GS105Ev2 for that purpose.
What is the best way to deal with this? Not set the IP at all? I prefer to manage this switch, but not at the cost of security.
There are a few options with different security risks.  You will have to decide which one(s) meets your needs.
If your firewall supports it, use secondary (private) addresses on the outside interface. NAT internal hosts to this subnet to talk to your poor choice of switch. This is logically creating a DMZ riding on the public network.
