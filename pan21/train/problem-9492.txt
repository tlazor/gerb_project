But I remember from AD that if you delete an account, re-create an account with the same details it would be considered a new user, and it would create a new user folder and the old user session you would not be able to logon too. Would this be the same? and if so is there a work around?
So the environment has been setup with Azure AD, all the computers (Windows and mac) are using Azure AD credentials to logon.
If we recreate the on premises AD - and sync with Azure AD - will this cause the user accounts to be still recognized, or will all workstations need to be reconfiguration to open a new session under the user account and then transfer the data? Or would it re-associate the same session?
Now we would like to create a hybrid environment, I already figured that we will need to rebuild the AD - export Azure AD and recreate on premises AD and then sync with azure AD - now for the questions;
So we're mostly a cloud based company (G suite, Azure AD etc.) Azure AD has too many limitations, we're going to work with new HR soft that wants a full fledged AD.
