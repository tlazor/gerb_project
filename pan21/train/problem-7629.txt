I believe the "badblocks" linux utility can do this.  (You might need a Linux boot disk to use it, unless you have a Linux like OS).
Would partitioning around unrecoverable sectors even be a workable way of reducing the disk of losing data?
I've seen a lot of hard drives with only a few bad (unrecoverable) sectors (as indicated by SMART). Of course the proper thing to do with a bad drive is replace it, as there's a good chance of the drive crashing completely in the near future; I'm aware of that. However, in the interim, or for those who don't want to spend $70 to save data they don't value highly anyway (sigh, non-technical people), or just to get some use out of old hardware instead of throwing it away, I'm wondering if there's a way to identify where the unrecoverable sectors are ("where" meaning numerically, from 0 to the number of sectors on the drive), so I could stick a blank partition in that general area. Yes, this would involve low-level-formatting the drive and reinstalling the OS, of course.
As the other posters have said though, this is an incredibly bad idea, and I would refuse to do it on principle.  Once a disk starts going bad it is likely to get worse.  There are many reasons for this, one of the easiest to understand is a tiny bit of the surface coming off the disk, and then being used as an abrasive which scratches the rest of the disk - which is spinning at high speed.  Invariably if a drive is getting damaged sectors it is an early sign its going to die.
