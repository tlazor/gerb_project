We recently set up a Windows Server 2008 box, and attached two external hard drives to it to use as backups.  
The idea is, the backups go to drive one nightly during the week, then someone takes drive1 home over the weekend and the backups go to drive2 while drive1 is not connected.  They come back, drive1 is plugged back in, and the backups direct back to drive1.
The only way I've found to do this is to unplug disk2 as I plug disk1 back in.  It starts sending backups to disk1, then the following morning I can plug disk2 back in...
It's not at all clear from the Microsoft documentation (what else is new!) but I believe having two backup destinations doesn't split the backup over two drives (which I kinda like) but actually writes the same backup to both drives.  So in theory, if you have both drives plugged in, both should be getting a nightly backup and your plan should work.  After you plug the drive back in after the next night does it get written to?  I'm not surprised that drive2 was still written to, but according to MS docs, drive1 should have had the same data written to it as well.
