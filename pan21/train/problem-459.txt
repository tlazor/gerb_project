but as Brandon indicated in his answer, I also had to edit the lightdm.conf file. Otherwise I got the graphical login prompt and an "x" placeholder above the login field where the Raspberry Pi logo would be. The auto login worked after the lightdm.conf edit.
I had changed the pi user name and disabled the root account password, then followed direction in the previous answer including the suggested edit to this:
I just want to add to the above that sometimes the auto-startx line can be found in /etc/rc.local especially when dealing with touchscreen images obtained from vendors. I once was trying to disable startx and did not think of it being here. The line will before exit 0. Just change the "pi" in that line to your new username and reboot!
I changed the default username using usermod from pi, but since raspi-config assumes the user is "pi", I am now unable to have it automatically boot into the GUI. Is there another way to do this other than manually starting X?
In my case, I did not actually change (or delte) the default user "pi" user, I simply created a new user for myself and wanted to boot to that user by default. In that case, even after doing the above, I still ran into the issue of the system booting to the "pi" user by default. For some reason, the sed line was not actually updating lightdm.conf. So I simply edited lightdm.conf, which implicitly lists "pi" as the autologin-user, to my username. After that, it would successfully boot to my new user by default.
