What these are for is securing your otherwise open browser for that page. I've experienced this sort of thing with government pages where you have to fill out important forms; so on top of removing your bookmarks and extensions they wont let you view source, type into the address bar or even right click in some cases.
Other than here, where windows are described as having types (normal, popup, panel, and app; but not explained) I can't seem to find any information on it.
I found this searching for way to keep my tool bars open in Firefox, This is October 24, 2016 and you may have already solved, but in case not here is what I just now figured out, right click the 'open menu' at far right on the menu bar tool bar, then 'de-select/un-check' the 'Slim Chrome' option, then your toolbars are locked open for you. 
Basically there's nothing you can do about it, this isn't a hack EA has done to get the browser to behave this way, it's enforced by the browser itself. No add on or extension will have jurisdiction to override this.
