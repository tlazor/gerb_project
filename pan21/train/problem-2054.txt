The last of which is written as "MouseIsXterm"=dword:00000002. Which is not binary; it's hexadecimal (dword or "double word" is 32 bits wide, which is written as 8 hex digits in .reg files).
I am fixing presets through the .reg file instead of in puTTy because I am going to make this an open source registry. Mostly changing themes, and my school doesn't know what the hell they are doing and most of us would rather have the right click (context menu) option available to us. Here is a quick example of what I am editing::
The easiest way to get a .reg file with your desired settings is to first set them through PuTTY – which conveniently has all the options described – then save into a session, and export that from Registry Editor. (You can even run a diff between the exported default session and custom session, to see what exactly changed.)
Which I am guessing dword accepts binary. Can someone tell me where in these options is the right click override? Or if there is documentation for dummys basically of what each of these properties mean give me the link so I can read it?
