Ultimately you're running out of IPs because you're targetting emails to people who don't want them, they're complaining and thus the IPs are being removed from your options.
Defining the line between hard and soft bounces is not easy and everyone seems to do it slightly differently.  It sounds to me like the company you're using is not doing a very good job of it.
You can use Senderscore to get an idea of what other mail servers think of these IP address's reputations.  (Hotmail use Senderscore so this is a good indication of how well you will reach Hotmail users.)  There are other reputation tracking companies around and you will usually have similar scores in all of them.
Because many receiving mail servers use IP reputations as a strong indicator, if not the only indicator of whether a mail is spam, it's not smart to mix customers with a good reputation and customers with a bad reputation on the same IP addresses.
There's no real technical way around this, other than moving email provider anyway but even that is really just postponing the issue. The process to protect internet users from people like yourself is working well here, and that's obviously inconveniencing you but in the scheme of things the ratios are about right.
If the reputation of your email provider is poor, I would recommend letting them know and then voting with your feet.  There are plenty of email providers out there and some do very good jobs.
On a purely personal level perhaps you should consider a job in another area as I don't believe what you're doing now is benefitting humanity in any way and think that what you do professionally should be thoroughly outlawed internationally - but as I say that's just my opinion.
