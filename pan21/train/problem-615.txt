This shows you can at least write code that reads and presents well. If you're coding in a professional environment, other people have to read the code you wrote as well and they need to understand it quickly. If they're scanning through the code then suddenly there's a random comment floating in the page it's a real distraction.
If I was to take your code then multiply it out 100 or a thousand times into other files (the size of a regular commercial/enterprise application then it would be a dog's breakfast and not maintainable at all.
A good book to read is Clean Code by Robert Martin. You must read this as if your life depended on it.
You need to take more care with your code and make it readable and consistent. Think of it as formatting your resume for a potential employer. Use consistent whitespace between characters, consistent comments above the code (not multiple line breaks between) and above all adopt one of the common style guides for the language. Winston posted an excellent example earlier.
