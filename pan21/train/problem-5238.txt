Just in case it makes a difference, I have been restarting docker each and every time I make a change.

I have the same problem here, using docker with snap. A look into the /var/log/syslog showed me issues with apparmor. 
It's like it is looking in the right place but can't read the file but I can't figure out why.  Permissions look like this:
I am trying to set up a docker registry on Ubuntu 18.06 that may be accessed from another PC (windows).  The connection is encrypted with an ssl certificate obtained from letsencrypt. 
Again, I can perform this login on my remote Windows system without any problems whatsoever.  It's only when I try to login on my local docker (in order to pull the image that was pushed up remotely, to run it) that it fails.
All permissions should be right.  Just in case it was trying to read that location as a file rather than a directory, I also tried a variant on this where I renamed my ca_bundle.crt as a file rather than a directory, at /etc/docker/certs.d/:.crt.  When I do that, I get an error stating that "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority", indicating that it cannot find any cert.
That's why the certs have to be placed in /var/snap/docker/common/etc/certs.d instead of /etc/docker/certs.d as written in the docker snap documentation.
The problem is that I cannot reach the repo from the local machine.  Upon attempting to log in, I get the following error:
