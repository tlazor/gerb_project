Now when checking Chrome's inspector, it seems my local web pages are loading slowly because of the DNS Lookup part. On a mygreatwebsite.local url also defined in the /etc/hosts file. 
After a quick check, it would seem that reducing the hosts file to a couple of lines, drastically speeds up the DNS lookup part. So my question, is it possible to be confronted with differences of about 5 seconds for 50 lines, and insignificant times for a couple of lines? Or am I completely missing  something? 
For various reasons I have hosts files on some machines with hundreds of entries. This has no impact on DNS lookups simply because once the machine has found an entry in the hosts file it will not do a lookup for the same information. If everything else is configured correctly educing the size of the hosts file won't affect performance because even with a thousand entries that file can still be parsed faster than performing a DNS lookup. Check the order in which your machine is resolving addresses. The hosts file should be first.
I'm facing a little question here. I have a long /etc/hosts file. (working in the web, so I'm hosting a lot of sites locally for developping). Let's says it is about 40, 50 lines long. 
Your tld .local could be the problem, zeroconf uses this. There is no real standard, but the suggested tld for an internal tld is .site or .internal. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain#Pseudo-domains for this.
Based on my testing, a 34 MB hosts file with a few million entries slows down browsing in Windows a bit even when the "DNS Client" service is disabled. So, there is a maximum size beyond which you probably don't want to go.
