I still keep Internet Explorer 6 in my Windows XP and I’ve had the 100% CPU issue in svchost.exe / wuaueng.dll. This only happened every second tuesday of these last two months, that is, Patch Tuesday. I managed to work it around in October, but last Tuesday I had same problem again.
Since I refused to update to IE8 and I read that there is some correlation between these two facts, I tried to manually download and install KB2888505 (Cumulative security update for Internet Explorer: November 12, 2013). It installed fine and after that, Windows Update detected, downloaded and installed remaining updates without any CPU hog. I guess that as long as I keep IE6 I’ll have to manually download and install its security patches from now on.
Running XP Pro 32Bit new install on a Dell Latitude D800. I had the same problem with Genuine Windows Update KB905474 freezing and using 100% CPU. I updated IE to IE8 but the update would still feeze and use 100% CPU. I shut off Automatic Updates and then used the Windows Update link and the custom install to install all updates except for KB905474. I then downloaded and saved the KB905474 update to my desktop. I shut down then rebooted into Safe Mode With Networking. I ran the KB905474 update in this mode and it installed with no issues. Shut down again rebooted back up on Normal Mode and turned Automatic Updates back on. The computer is run ning fine with no issues. This worked for me with the KB905474 update hopefully it will help you.
So, the key here is IE6; the easy solution is to upgrade to IE8; the workaround is to manually install its security updates when Windows Update Agent gets stuck using 100% CPU.
I gave up and installed Windows 7 Professional x86_64. svchost ate up the CPU when I checked for updates, but updates were found a minute later, so everything's good now. Something must be wrong with Microsoft's Windows XP ISOs on DreamSpark
Finally I managed to download an IE8 install program (found mine on Clubic but should exist at MS for your particular language).
