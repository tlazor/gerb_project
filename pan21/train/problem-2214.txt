In short: yes, you can setup a network with a single switch, and a single router, and it may fit all your needs.  Probably not... but it might.
Questions about security should first be thought in terms of "protect what/who from what/who".  i.e. protect students from visiting websites with questionable content?  protect outside hackers from gaining access to your systems? etc...
Without knowing the requirements for security, reliability, bandwidth, etc... you could be talking about a huge number of possible answers.  It's like telling a librarian you need a book... and not offering any information about your needs in that book.  (fiction? reference? subject? etc...)
This really isn't a well-formulated question.  It really does lead to too many tangents, and opens itself up to a lot more questions than it will ever answer.
The most important question to answer first is: "What exactly do you want to achieve?"  You cannot reliably/accurately hit a target that keeps changing.  Come up with a list of specific things you wish to provide.  And by specific, I mean things like "Access websites on the Internet" or "Share files" or "Provide Email".  You can also get more detailed things like "Access 3 specific websites on the internet" rather than a general "Access the Internet".  (the more specific you can be, the better)
If this is not your full-time-job, you probably should consider talking with a consultant who does this for a living.  There are many MANY things that should to be considered.  (for liability reasons, as well as simply wanting to provide features)
Maintaining the systems should also be a consideration.  After you turn them on, who will be "mr-fixit?"  Do you plan on growing?  Do you need to share resources?  (files/printers/???)  Do you wish to require usernames/passwords to access certain resources? etc...
