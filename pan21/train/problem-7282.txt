I figure maybe it'll create the PDF when it doesn't exist so I enter in a non-existent PDF and get a "File not found; Check the file name and try again" error.
Before Acrobat X and later XI were released there was an option in the Acrobat menu to create a blank PDF. This option has now been moved to the Tools Pane under 'Pages > More Insert Options choose Insert Blank Page (Shift-Ctrl-Q or Shift-CMD-Q)'.
Going to File -> Create says I can create PDF's from files, scanners, web pages, etc, but there's no option to let me create one from scratch. I guess I could create a blank page in Word, print that to a PDF and then open that but that seems like a rather indirect way. Is that really the only way to do this?
I'd recommend downloading one of the many free A4 PDF Templates online and making your own A4 Template (with margins, etc) from that.
If you want to add the option to create a blank PDF back to the File menu then you can do that using a small JavaScript that that is available from here:
