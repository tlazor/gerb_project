I've seen that OSX lets you create application shortcuts, however they don't seem to be working for me for iTunes. I've tried to create a shortcut named 'Play', which matches the name of the command in the iTunes menu exactly, yet when I use the shortcut I just get a standard warning sound from OSX that you get when you're trying to do something that you cannot do.
I've found an application that took care of this nicely for me. I should also note that this was made more difficult because I have a non-Mac keyboard, so I couldn't just use OSX's built-in shortcut for iTunes, as that only seems to work on Mac keyboards.
EDIT: I have found that I can create a shortcut for the 'Stop' command, just not 'Play'. And the 'Stop' shortcut I've created only works when iTunes is the application in focus. So now I'm even more confused.
It took about 1 minute to download and install, and another 1-2 minutes for me to figure out how to make a trigger for iTunes.
I listen to music while I work, and it can be tedious to have to locate iTunes to turn my music on/off, which I have to do often. I want to setup shortcuts so I can start/stop my music no matter what application I'm currently in.
