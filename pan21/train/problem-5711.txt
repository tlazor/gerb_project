Trying to measure the actual memory usage is long and complicated. It's much simpler to look at the output of 'free' and compare that with the number of httpd processes running - although in your case, with such low traffic, you might want to reconfigure your server to reduce the number of idle httpd processes.
no. If only it were that simple. I had a quick google to find some links about memory management on Linux but there's an awful lot of bad information on the internet. While this kind of description is kind of workable (if inaccurate) for a single instance of a process, the picture for a self-forking daemon is very different.
Wordpress and Joomla are both in that category that needs to be given enough memory and an efficient server platform that has been optimized beyond the OEM out-of-the-box installation you normally get on cheaper web hosting.
This is a standard observation on any resource intensive PHP application being run with the Apache PHP5 DSO module interpreter. 
I've had a farm of 1Gb boxes comfortable handling 200+ clients each via Apache/PHP.  While a lot will depend on the nature of your application, I certainly wouldn't expect to be running out of memory with 11.
An all time world renowned resource hog, Magento is really good at testing out and proving that you need either a Fast-CGI installation to quit converting Apache into a very inefficient PHP interpreter, or better yet move over to LiteSpeed and lsphp5 for speed and efficiency.
