I have this chipset, and I too had problems with debian.  What worked for me was installing Ubuntu, since it ships with a much newer kernel (it is based on Debian).  My wireless card is supported out of the box in version 12.04 (long term support release) and in version 12.10.  I personally prefer elementary OS, which is based on Ubuntu 12.04.  You should decide what desktop environment you want and choose your variant based on that (Ubuntu for Unity, Kubuntu for KDE, Xubuntu for XFCE, Lubuntu for LXDE).  These are by no means your only choices, you can also go with Linux Mint (which is also based on Ubuntu) which includes either the Cinnamon or Mate desktops.  Best of luck.
Building the module requires the kernel headers to be installed (it took me a while to figure this out).  Then it’s a matter of downloading the compat-drivers source, uncompressing it and following the instructions available in the [compat-drivers documentation] (sorry, I wasn't allowed to post a third link).  I’m happy I found it out:  this looks to me like a complete answer  by all accounts — except my own.  I’m so much of a newbie that I couldn’t manage to build the module.  I did generate a makefile using the driver-select script to specify the ath9k driver, but the make command failed — here is the output (the actual output is in Portuguese, this is my own fallible back-translation into English):
I continued to snoop around and found a solution to my compatibility problem (although I wasn’t able to make it work so far — in the end I’ll describe my attempt).  So, here are my answers to the main questions posed above:
