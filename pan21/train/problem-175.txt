What I have discovered is that if I change my local LAN to 192.168.2.0, I am able to reach 192.168.1.1 on the remote LAN. But since I travel a lot and cannot always connect to a network I manage, I cannot ensure the local subnet will not match the remote one. Thus I wish to be able to reach the remote LAN regardless of the local setup. How is this achieved?
First I should mention that the local and and remote LANs sit on 192.168.1.0. My local/client LAN router is sitting at 192.168.1.1. The remote LAN router is also sitting on 192.168.1.1. Actual VPN server is sitting on 192.168.1.73. What I want is to type 192.168.1.1 in the browser and reach the remote LAN. I have been able to do this on my Android phone, but not on my Linux laptop. I use absolutely identical settings on both devices. The reason behind this effort is that I want to be able to access my remote/VPN LAN regardless of the network I am currently connected at the moment - I travel a lot. Here's the config files:
I have also set up dnsmasq to make sure DNS queries are dealt with on the VPN server. This works fine. The only issue remaining as I said before is when I try to load 192.168.1.1 from the client. On my Android phone, this redirects to the remote router as I want it to. But on my Linux machine it goes to my local router, which I do not want. I fail to understand how and why the laptop sees the local LAN when I have instructed it to communicate everything through the remote LAN.
