You might be able to SMB mount a windows machine, but we don't have a built0-in volume driver for SMB.
We want to migrate some applications to google kubernetes. One of these applications is strictly bound to a folder, from which it reads files, which are exported from a third-party application. My dewy-eyed idea from an easy windows-mount or similar was destroyed at a great pace. My second idea with a google bucket, rclone and fuse is "okay" but not optimal for lots of small files.
I'm not sure that this is possible using default GCE/GKE resources/options, I think that you want to check FS on GCE but using the filer option since per what you are explaining a PD isn't going to be helpful. About best option for cp, I found this best practices for Google Cloud Storage. 
You would do better to upload to GCS and sync to your pods (or FUSE, I guess) or to upload your data to git and sync down to pods with a git-sync sidecar.  This has the nice property that you can pin versions, roll back, etc.
