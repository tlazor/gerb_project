I don't care about compilation time and the amount of modules that are not built-in. I'm concerned about performance. I don't know how much memory and runtime is wasted on huge kernels with almost everything possible.
Just use the default kernel for your (server) distribution. It won't matter for dev purposes and for tuning a production system you need an expert anyway (who will look at the kernel compilation options last). 
could please anybody recommend some kind of kconfig generator that would trim modules and built-in stuff that is not needed according to current hardware ?
I'm a java developer and I don't know what most of the modules and drivers are for. So there is not much I can disable and be sure that I don't screw it up.
You could look into genkernel from gentoo linux, it seems to deal with issues you are concerned about.
Is this for a specific embedded system? In general, changing compile options isn't going to make a big difference. Where performance matters, the modern kernel generally either automatically selects the best option, or else offers run-time tunables. You'd be better off working with those, or tuning your Java environment and your code.
