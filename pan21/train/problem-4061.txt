Only a single connection is required to the each of the power pins (you appear to have no understanding of parallel connections, these are not additive).
By the way voltages do not add up in the way you think.  You can have a hundred 5V pins on the expansion header, they all add up to 5V, not 500V, they are connected in parallel.
The display appears to use the SPI interface pins plus 3 other GPIO 11,18,22. Combined with the power and ground this could be connected with 11 wires.
You only need to utilise one 3.3V, one 5V, and one GND pin from the Pi.  The voltage supply pins and the ground pins are often referred to as rails, e.g. the ground rail, the 5V power rail, etc.  All the ground pins are connected together on the Pi.  Similarly all the 5V pins are connected to the other 5V pins, and all the 3V3 pins are connected to the other 3V3 pins.  There are more than one of each simply for wiring convenience.
So you can choose one ground pin and connect that to each LCD socket which was connected to ground.  How you do that is a wiring problem.  Breadboards typically have ground and power rails so you can plug in one ground and power wire but jumper it from anywhere on the rail.  Similarly choose one 3V3 pin and one 5V pin.  You will probably find that you do not need both the 3V3 and 5V power connected.
I have some reservations about the mechanical stability of attaching with jumper wires, but you could use a breadboard.
You should definitely connect everything which is not marked as 3.3V, 5V, or GND on a one to one basis.  I.e. use a (female-male) jumper wire from the Pi pin to the corresponding LCD socket.
