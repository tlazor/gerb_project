Fourth, could it be power related?  Is it possible that the power was not filtered or was the monitor plugged into a socket that could have power issues (say an airconditioner or some other large load was attached so the power dropped?)
First is the monitor a CRT or LCD flat panel?  The CRT is way more sensitive to electronic interference.  Put a magnet by a CRT and the beam moves around - the LCD is not affected.
Second, what was the screen resolution and refresh rate set to?  If the screen resolution or refresh rate is not capable of being handled by the monitor, you get strange issues.
Third, you should identify the video card and load the proper driver.  Do a search support.dell.com and search by the service tag.  Look for the original system configuration page and it should tell you what the original equipment was.  Failing that, open the system up and take a look.  If you're in luck it will be a discrete card you can pull out and take a look at.  If not, look on the motherboard for the video chip.
