Wifi speed ratings are a scam - outside labratory conditions you are unable to reach the promised speeds.  The most likely candidate for the problem is your WIFI connection.
Simply speaking if you download a single 1 large file and you get 30MB/s, it is entirely possible that if you downloaded 4 files simultaneously you will get 20MB/s on each, so total thoughput would be 60MB/s - depending on the protocol there is software available which can do this seemlessly. 
Getting back to WIFI, have a look at this article whic shows that you can't expect advertised speeds, and gives you an indication of what you can expect.  Although the information is from 2013, it has remained true since WIFI became commonplace.
Don't make the mistake of assuming that a 802.11AC 1.3 Gbps advertised rate will give you that speed for each device. The speed you get depends on how many antennae both the AP and the client have, and you need to realize that Wi-Fi is half-duplex, and it must take into account other radio interference. Likely, your wireless client on has one antenna, and, even at 160 MHz, you won't get anywhere near 1.3 Gbps. If your transfer protocol uses TCP (likely), you will lose performance due to the window size and wait for ACKs. Also, there will be protocol overhead in the packets which can significantly reduce data transfer rate.
I note that while a 1GB connection can give 1GB of throughput, it is quite common for a switch port to connect at 1gb but only provide a fraction of the throughput.
You should also look at packet sizes (Jumbo Frames).   Larger packet sizes will provide better throughput - although this can be hard to set up.  The alternative is to break a transfer up into multiple concurrent connections.
The first thing I would try would be to connect the devices so both use ethernet cables and see the performance.  If you get the performance you can be pretty sure its with the WIFI, otherwise you have narrowed it down somewhat.
