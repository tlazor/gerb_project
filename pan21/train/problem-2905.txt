I'm getting the following error when trying to launch the Virtual Console, but the Virtual Console Preview works fine (it displays a small preview about once a second). I've confirmed that my M610 DRAC has the latest firmware (3.60 build 3), that Java is properly configured to avoid security issues, and I have the latest version of Oracle Java (version 7 update 55). I'm running OS X, but google shows others having this issue with other operating systems. Perhaps it's an OpenJDK vs Oracle Java issue? I have not been able to test on another client system yet
It appears you need X11 started to get it to work too. It will start automatically, but that seems iffy vs. starting it ahead of time.  If you don't reinstall X11.app, it doesn't work - it really needs to be there.
Here's what we did. I'll admit this is one of the more strage ways to solve a problem... and it's total luck that we stumbled upon this as a solution (workaround, really.)  These are internal notes that several of use used to get it working.
We ran into this problem in the office.  Our setup is with Asus motherboards, but I think everyone uses ASPEED BMCs, and they all use the same base JViewer software from AMI.  The symptom is we would get the same traceback as posted in the original question, but it would work fine under Linux and Windows.
