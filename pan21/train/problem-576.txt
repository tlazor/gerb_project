However, if it's a real problem, and your testbed isn't generating the production load (real number of concurrent users pulling order reports or doing end-of-month activities, real stress-tests), then you can't do a good job of proving him wrong, either.
So, push them for evidence of the problem - under what conditions is performance impacted, do they have sizing guidelines, etc. It's possible that your install won't fall prey to what he's claiming is a known problem.
In general yes, but as I said above, it's not just CPU, RAM, and LAN bandwidth. There's also things like disk IO, and weird Windows things like Session Desktop Heap and GDI counters, that a single-user system very rarely has problems with.
There are still application vendors today that will not commit to saying that their application will work properly under Citrix, or VMware. In some cases, they even know that there are active problems. ERP apps can be tough nuts to crack, because in a lot of cases, you're getting all the install and support through a VAR, so you might not have access to a vendor KB or support forums.
It's possible that there are known problems though - if their application does stupid things like a ton of small disk writes, it can cause performance problems on a multi-concurrent-desktop-user system like Citrix or TS, especially if you don't have things like a write-cache on your storage system. Some software, and I've seen ERP software like this, assumes that only one user will have all the system resources available as needed.
