With electronic components it is not so difficult to achieve: one or two transistors, one capacitor and few resistances are enough. Just search for "Dealy circuit" in google and you'll get lot of examples. If still interested, I can calculate the values of the elements for you.
Specifically, the computer/BIOS is set to boot to the USB drive first, which I must emphasize cannot be changed. Also the goal is to leave the device plugged in because the computer powers on and off regularly and the port is located in a difficult place to reach frequently. The dongle is causing start up issues since it is not a bootable drive. I need a physical device to prevent power and/or data connection when it receives power with the PC is booting. Or some other creative way to get around this.
I've been trying to search for a physical adapter that would accept a USB (not a flash drive, but a software dongle) and connect into a USB port that would literally delay the pass-through of the device to the port. 
I suspect the most sensible solution would be to get a extension cable, and a USB hub with switches for each port - that way, you can get the USB drive in reach and switch off the port when not in use. I can't think of anything that would delay connection, without a lot of soldering an a microcontroller.
