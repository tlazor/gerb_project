No all 127.0.0.1 traffic never hits the physical network, it gets processed by a loop back adapter in the kernel.
It depends on what OS you're running, but Windows 2000 had a bug in it where requests on the loopback adaptor would be slow. There's some useless trivia for you!
I'd rather say that you find your answer in it's name itself. The name says: "Local Loopback Address", which in itself means that the network never intervenes in the process and the request is in itself looped back locally.
You don't mention a particular OS but for most all that happens is that the data travels down the stack until it gets to IP at which point it's pretty much sent back. That's a massive oversimplification but means that the entire process is usually CPU bound so its performance is therefore directly linked to CPU speed plus stack efficiency. In practical terms modern CPUs and OSs should be able to 'bounce' loopback traffic considerably faster than 40Gbps - which is the fastest NIC I think I'm capable of buying today. Hope this helps.
