I'm not sure a SQL database is your best solution here. They're not really meant as end-user tools more as back-end storage for applications. 
I'm a literature student and I'd like to be able to annotate literary texts (originally stored in HTML or as text files) on a word-by-word or line-by-line basis. I hear databases like mySQL or SQLite would be good ways to do this sort of thing, but I don't really know where to start. 
Once you learn the basics of SQL, if you want to make a database for annotating lines, you could read each line of a text file separately into a table called LINES_OF_TEXT using the LOAD DATA INFILE command in MySQL.  You can then have another table called ANNOTATIONS that refers to entries in the LINES_OF_TEXT table; that way you can have multiple annotations for each line of text.  E.g.:
You might be better off with just a spreadsheet ... OR ... why not come up with your own annotation scheme, e.g. <!-- MYNOTE: This is a note !-->, and add it to the file directly. Then using an indexed search program (e.g. lucene) you'd be able to find your annotations quickly.
I'm comfortable with the linux command-line, and have done some HTML/CSS work in the past, so I feel unintimidated by databases and things...I just don't know what to start doing.
