By limiting that to one what will happen is the following: a browser will try to load the HTML that is your crappy web page. Once that succeeds it will see that that page depends on a number of external css files, images and script resources. Then  it will send a number of parallel request to load those. Rather than handling those concurrently those apache settings  will only allow apache to be able to send those resources one after the other, sequentially rather than  concurrently. That takes forever !
You don't want a web server that can barely support one concurrent site visitor... Adjust those settings. 
Consider placing a caching reverse proxy server before your dockers to reduce the number of hits forwarded to each docker container and adjusting the settings to something a little more sane to make each docker container more responsive.
You do realise that the pre-fork MPM is designed to spawn child processes for each request and each child process only serves one request at a time. See How do I select which Apache MPM to use?
