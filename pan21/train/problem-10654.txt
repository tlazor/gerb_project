Got myself a server connected to a SAN. We would like to install Netbackup on it (to back up this and one other server). 
With respect to MattBianco, I am leaving this job so I will turn the VG naming issue over to another (vastly more experienced) sysadmin to rename the second VG under controlled circumstances (in case applications depending on it blow up - you never know around here). By then he'll have reliable backup to depend on. If I were sticking around I might have tackled it or assisted him. I have no idea why the sysadmin creating this filesystem did what he did. One of the reasons I'm glad he's not there any longer...
@Bittrance, @Gilles, got me moving again, looking at the problem differently, and @Poige gave me the final big link I was missing. I ended up using the command LVM .... /dev/sda1 to create the partition within the existing local-disk PV. Turned out there was 18gb free space, of which I used 15. 
I would like to create a new partition within an LVM, about 10-15gb, on the local disk only. However, the Volume Group for the space allocated on the SAN is the same group name as what's allocated on the local disk. 
I think pvdisplay tells you free PEs on that physical volume. I assume that means PEs not allocated to logical volumes.
pvmove(8) can be used to move physical extents within a logical volume between different physical volumes.
How can I determine my available space on the local disk only, within the logical volume? I’d like to avoid using the SAN space as it may cause performance and/or other issues we don’t want. LVDISPLAY shows all LV stats, and VGS shows available space for the entire volume group. The physical volume itself has no available space to create a new partition or LV. 
If you hadn't already begun, it could have been a good idea to keep local and SAN disks in different volume groups.
