The other thing I would look for is connectivity... you would like a provider which is also a ISP or a Backbone.
By co-incidence this morning I was putting together an RFP on this very subject! Obviously you need to ask what their security arrangements are, and are they accredited - but probe a little deeper and find out how they have assessed the risks internally: how do they vet new staff and monitor privileged access, what is their procedure when an accident takes place, how do they learn from their mistakes?
Find out if they have a good understanding of electricity distribution as this is one area where in my experience some hosters screw up, e.g. they have highly reliable supplies into the building then overload the distribution unit in your pod, or they put twin power supplies in all your servers then run both sides of the rack from the same circuit breaker.
Look carefully at what monitoring they do for you. It will save you time and please your boss if you get a nice daily or weekly report which tells you when your mail server is running out of storage etc. There are many levels of sophistication in this area and you may want to tailor your performance monitoring to your applications so that the measures are as close as possible a proxy for user experience.
See if there are any options to have the shared site mirrored... I know personally that HostMySite.com used to set these up for a bit more than shared hosting... not so much now...
