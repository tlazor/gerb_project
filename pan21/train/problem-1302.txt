Do you have a group policy that deploys the software? While it won't redeploy automatically if someone removes the software you can use the procedure documented at http://www.frickelsoft.net/blog/?p=103 to force it to reinstall. 
As others have said it's a management issue but there is a way to reinstall an application if you have a client on the domain and deploy the software via group policy. 
This is not entirely true, it really depends on how much work you want to do and how savy you think they are.  Look at the idea posted here: http://discuss.pcmag.com/forums/thread/106231001.aspx  I'd be willing to bet that would work just fine
Is there a way to prevent a Windows Vista client who is a local administrator of her own machine to remove a installed program? The program should not be removed by clients either from normal mode or safe mode.
If you can remotely access the computer's registry you could remove the GUID of the application and then group policy would take care of it.
No. If they are a local administrator, they have full privileges over their machine, you can't prevent them from doing anything.
