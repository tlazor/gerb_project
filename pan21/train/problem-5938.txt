Also, do you have per-port ACL's? That could also require CPU switching which would be orders of magnitude slower than in ASIC. Do you have the same problem when running pings, in that the  first ping has 100ms delay, and then subsequent pings are <1ms? If it's a lower end switch and only getting delay on tcp/ip, I'd check that there isn't an ACL that is applied to TCP/IP packets.
I would also check the switch for CPU load, even if it's low usage, if it's got some stupid config that is causing it to switch in CPU, it can easily be overloaded. We've overloaded high end switches (10Gbps backhaul) with traffic in the 100Mbps range because we were inadvertently sending traffic that had to be switched within the CPU.
Have you checked the cabling?  Bad cables and/or punchdowns can result in retries that can greatly increase latency.
What model of Cisco switch are you using? One thing that could be happening is if the switch doesn't know which port you're server is on, it will need to flood all ports with the packet, which could take time (shouldn't take 100ms though). You can verify by running TCP dump on another server that isn't one of the two servers you are using. Once the server responds, it will then learn the port-mac assignment and do the forwarding in asic. This could be especially prevalent on lower end cisco switches.
