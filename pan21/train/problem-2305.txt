If you're afraid of administering a linux server, you could always install webmin as there is a debian package for it. Really helps me out (as a sysadmin) at work since I can create them an account on a server with webmin installed and the devs can actually figure out how to get their code running on it (our devs are devs with most of them having zero *nix experience).
Node.js is super simple to install and setup. If I were you, I'd just pickup a VPS at any hosting company (I prefer linode) and then you'd have a full linux machine that you'd be free to host other projects on as well.
I love my free ec2 instance and plan on signing up for one using my gf's Amazon account after it's not so free in hopes to extend the free-ness.
Both offer a Heroku-style platform-as-a-service, which I have fallen in love with. I have too much to manage in life already, and these service require very little time to get up and going and also maintain.  Unfortunately both are in some stage of beta, but no harm in putting in a request for a beta invite and seeing what happens.
Also, Amazon's micro ec2 instance is free for a year, allows for 10gb of S3 storage, and 10gb of EB storage - there are AMI's already out there, such as these Ubuntu Server AMI's that will fit on the 10gb EB storage limit (just make sure you install the elastic block version).
