That is possible if you work with a large workbook and the Calculation setting is set to Automatic. 
Here is additional information which might be helpful as well - What can cause slow copy and paste in Excel?
I frequently want to copy data into every other row, so I end up hitting paste repeatedly on the same set of copied data, until Excel freezes and I have to wait for it.
Using paste from the clipboard repeatedly may cause performance lag or freezing. To avoid this, use multiple select (Ctrl + Click) to choose all the cells you want the content in, then paste. 
Please try to temporarily switch to the manual mode (Options->formulas-> workbook calculation -> manual) and paste again. 
I'm hoping someone else has encountered this same problem and has a workaround or solution for this, as when I have to fill in a hundred columns of data this really slows me down.
I've had this problem on three different computers, in both Office Excel 2013 and Office Excel 2010, so it doesn't seem specific to any particular computer setup. 
I have had a frequent problem in Excel 2013 and Excel 2010 on several different computers, where Excel would freeze for 10-20 seconds when I copied a few cells into 3 or more locations. 
I cleared the conditions (Conditional Formatting / Clear Rules / Clear Rules from Selected Cells) and it worked. I even reinstated the original rule and it still works :)
Try to copy and paste in a new workbook. If it works, look into the problematic book â€“ VBA macro, many conditional formatting rules, links to other workbooks...
