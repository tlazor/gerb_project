They do make some switches with the power and ports on the back and led's on the front. They are usually called AV switches but they function the same. Example... luxul.com
In server closets, individual or small cluster of racks, as has already been mentioned, people will sometimes choose to mount the equipment reversed.  This is fully supported by the manufacturers who generally place mounting holes for ears both front and back.
The same holds true for large data centers, where primary switches will be centralized with distribution out to individual servers or network equipment housed in racks throughout facility.  Again, easier to change as needed by having everything front facing.
The reason is most environments (think business office rather than server closet) use switch ports primarily connected to patch pannels.  These, of course, run to office / cubes.  Very often all wall ports in a building are not live, but will be connected based on need.  By having both the switch ports and the patch panel ports facing front, making changes as people move is easier than reaching into the back of the rack.
Because typically, networking gear goes into its own racks, and servers go into their own racks. The network rack will often have patch panels in it, also on the front, so that the cables all just go into cable management - on the side of the racks and/or across the front of the racks.
We place all of our switches and firewalls facing the back of the rack. It cuts down on the blinking lights up front, but makes cable management easier. I never really thought about why they are like this, but I would love to know why if anyone else can add some insight.
