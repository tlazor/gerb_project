The CentOS box, which runs 24 hours, had a mod time on /dev/null of around 4 days ago (during which time it was essentially just being used as a web browser and multimedia player, although it would have had active but essentially unused Apache, MySQL and VMM processes running in the background).
The timestamp on /dev/null on the Debian machine, which was a just booted laptop, pretty much reflected the boot time, but I tested redirecting STDIN from, and STDOUT to it, and the modification time was unchanged (I'm not sure 100% sure if directing data to /dev/null constitutes "writing to it" in the way it would a normal file).
At present I can't entirely rule out this be something specific to the Application being used at my workplace, so I compared with CentOS and Debian based computers at home last night. 
I've been working on a problem with a /dev/null file on an AIX system (just for background it looks as though it was inadvertently deleted and recreated as a normal file  by somebody), but in trying to determine what caused the problem, I noticed that the timestamp on it seems to update every minute. I've observed this on several AIX servers at my workplace.
So my question is essentially, could anybody please offer any advice with regards to what circumstances (permissions changes etc.. aside) might cause the timestamp on /dev/null to update?
