The issue was actually caused by Nvidia. Their Geforce Experience program was updated recently and their "Share" feature was updated and when enabled, that's when the problem happened. As soon as the feature was disabled on the PC i was remotely logging in to, the issue was fixed. 
Would anyone know why after an RDP session either from my smartphone or from another PC, when I wake my computer and then proceed to log in, I get a black screen with cursor. I am running Windows 10 Pro 64bit, and haven't had this problem before. After the remote desktop session, it lets me get a lockscreen and prompts me to log in with my password but afterwards, either hitting enter or the arrow, I just get a black screen and the cursor. I am not able to hit any shortcuts or keypresses to make anything come up. ctrl+alt+del, ctrl+shift+esc, alt+f4, nothing seems to work. I only have one monitor so it's not an issue with windows not being able to recognize my default display like other Windows 10 users have been having, this seems to be different.
