I had a few builds failing for "no space left on device" so I suspect this is where all images end up going. 
Daniel's answer is right but I found an easier solution. In my case, I think I did migrate from docker-toolbox back in the days which locked by database to ~17G. I found it easier to follow these instructions:
And did a df -h. It says I have a /dev/sda1 mounted on /var/lib/docker/overlay2 with 64 GB of disk space. 
Docker Desktop 2.0 on MacOSX allows you to change the size of the disc in the GUI. Go to Preferences->Disk and increase the disc image size.
