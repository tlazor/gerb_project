It's called Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  Basically IPv6 (unlike IPv4) has autoconfiguration protocols in the absence of a DHCP server built into its design.
For IPv6 networks, in addition to the link-local address, you also have SLAAC. In a routed IPv6 infrastructure, routers can supply clients with network info via ICMP the way a DHCP server normally would.  And since IPv6 has these protocols built into the spec, any IPv6 router would support these requests from clients if configured to do so.
Also, the IPv6 address space is so incredibly big that clients can randomly assign themselves addresses with little risk of collision with other hosts.
The address start with fe80:: is link-local address .if your system is ipv6 enabled,system will automatically generate this address. It's called Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).For this we dont need any DHCP server.This address Scope is only with in the particular subnet..you cant not access that address from any other subnet.System automatically generating this address from system MAC address.YOU can check this link http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ipv6/ipv6_address_types.htm
In IPv4, if a network adapter is configured for DHCP but no DHCP server responds, it will auto-assign itself an address of 169.254.x.x(/16).  This is called a link-local address.  Any computer using a link-local address can communicate with other computers using link-local addresses if they are on the same network segment.  The key here is that link-local addressing is not a part of the IPv4 spec; it's a de-facto standard popularized by Microsoft.
The fe80:: addresses are link-local addresses. Every system automatically configures those on all its interfaces. They are assigned by the system to itself. You can't use them beyond the local link (network, vlan etc) as they are non-routable.
In this way, an entire IPv6 infrastructure could conceivably auto-configure itself entirely without any kind of IP address management system.
