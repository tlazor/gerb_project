I'm running Ubuntu 8.04 on this server. I had PHP 5.2 installed via the package manager. I removed it to install PHP 5.3.1 by hand. I built the packages like so
I had previously installed php on this system without apache and then I had tried reinstalling php from the same source directory with different config settings. 
Any ideas what's causing this error? All the references I can see have to do with building php5 packages for php4 or the like. PHP4 has never been installed on this machine.
You built php5 but you did'nt rebuilt the glue between apache and php5. Since you are using mod_php5, it fails (logical).
You may be able to run php script thanks to fastcgi (I assume your built-by-hand php 5.3.1 is ok), but anyway I recommend you to act in another manner.
You can get the packaging sources with: apt-get source php5, provided you have a deb-src source in /etc/apt/sources.list
Moreover PHP5 is a big piece of software, you really should not do that for maintenance and security purposes.
I had this same problem and what I did was delete my php source directory, re-extract the tarball and then compile again and everything worked fine.
As @zecrazytux indicated, did you install the appropriate apache-dev packages? PHP could well have built without them, even though you told it where they were. You need to look at the ./configure output.
