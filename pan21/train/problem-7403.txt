You both install. One of you creates a new share folder, generate a key. The other creates a new share folder, uses the key from the first user. Files are now automagically synced. There's some decent code in it for getting through firewalls and NATs and such.
Upside, no router craziness, you just install files for both of you. There are clients for most OS'es, including iOS and Android. And it's all local non-cloud (DropBox does fingerprinting of certain files).  There's even a way of getting a plugin for FreeNAS.  There's no FTP uploads. You "upload" or share by copying your file to a normal folder.  You can have multiple share folders.  One for your personal stuff. One for your neighbor share, etc.  Recent versions also do pic backup from iOS (maybe android too). You can even share from a distance - take your movies on the road on vacations.  Want to add a third? Give them the key.
Downside (maybe) these are copies of files. You'd both have these big files on your machines. (Though mobile OS versions don't automagically download files).
