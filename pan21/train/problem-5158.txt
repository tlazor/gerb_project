Once you come up with an appropriate firewall script, you would need to arrange for it to become active when your system starts up.  The man pages on launchd, launchctl, and launchd.plist may all be helpful.
You should be able to accomplish this using the "ipfw" utility from the command line.  The firewall available via the "Security" preference pane (new in OS X 10.5, I think) won't allow you to block outbound traffic.
DNSCrypt is a way of securing the "last mile" of DNS traffic and resolving an entire class of serious security concerns with the DNS protocol e.g. tampering, or man-in-the-middle attacks, and snooping of DNS traffic at the last mile.
You would use a firewall to (a) restrict all outbound network traffic other than traffic destined for your VPN server, and then (b) permit any traffic over your VPN interface.  The restrictions in (a) would have to include allowances for negotiating a DHCP lease, unless you're using static addressing.
Be aware that even ipfw rules can not protect you from a number of common leaks, including DNS leakage, IPv6 leakage and the time lag between when the network comes up and when the default route is changed! I use waterroof on my mac to work with firewall configurations, and the following sets of rules should import into Waterroof:
I'm using Snow Leopard and am using the shell script below. It only permits traffic through the PPTP VPN tunnel. Note that it doesn't make any exceptions for local DHCP traffic.
