We're not seeing any problems running a standard Sophos Endpoint deployment across 200+ Virtual machines on 5 hosts and dual iSCSI GbE connections to each host. Real-time scanning certainly adds some overhead but it's not a showstopper.
We're starting to ramp up our Virtual Machine operations and are increasingly running more and more Windows guests.  As far as I can tell traditional antivirus programs are not a scalable solution for large deployments because of the load they put on the guests and the storage while they're running.  At best we would be able to get away with a couple of dozen Windows guests, running staggered scans at nights and on the weekend..
Most traffic to the Virtual Machines is in the form of email and remote desktop sessions - however, some people do map drives to the virtual machine to transfer files.
Thus far we haven't seen any more problems with scanning virtual machines than with physical ones. If you have lots of machines then staggering is more important. We generally scan at night and don't have any clients who work overnight so it doesn't matter.
You need to do some obvious stuff like excluding file types that are going to cause you hassle (mdf ldf, \WinSXS, \NTDS  etc) and disable AV scanning entirely when you're backing up/restoring (use pre/post op commands).
What is the best way to handle antivirus scanning for Virtual Machines in the general case?  We're using RHEV so product specific options like vShield Endpoint aren't an option.
