First of all, it's worth mentioning that you should ensure you have the most up-to-date video drivers for your GPU installed.
Details can be found in the article linked above, as well as the ARB_pixel_buffer_object extension spec, but in general, you'd do the following:
Note also that with PBOs the glGetTexImage() call is asynchronous.  That is, you can do additional work on the CPU or GPU between steps 2 and 3, while the memory transfer runs in the background.  When you call glMapBuffer() it will wait for the transfer to finish, if it's not already done.
You might be able to get better performance by using a Pixel Buffer Object (PBO) to read back your render target.  A PBO can be created with a hint to the driver to locate the buffer in main memory; the GPU then transfers the render target contents to the PBO.  Strangely enough, on some (many?) systems it's faster for the GPU to write to main memory than for the CPU to read video memory.
However, all this being done, you may or may not see a performance improvement.  This is all down to the driver and how it decides to allocate memory, schedule work, etc.  Unfortunately, working on a PC you don't have much control over this stuff.
