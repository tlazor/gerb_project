This will remove (clean) all server and client side rules. There may be a rule that's become corrupted/hidden that's causing the problem. If so, this should resolve it.
Is it possible that a client-side spam filter that runs only within Outlook that is molesting these e-mails?  Check your Junk Mail settings to make sure.
Deleteing the mailbox and creating a new one seems like a pretty drastic measure to resolve this kind of problem. If the problem only occurs when Outlook is open then that tells me that Outlook is the culprit, not the mailbox. I would suggest starting outlook from Run using the following:
Make sure to set the default to the "Mailbox - User" folder group. This is the server mailbox, any other option will remove the emails from the server and move them to the computer locally, thus rendering all of Exchange recovery tools useless on that mailbox.
When the phone syncs with the server it sees the email, but outlook is naturally slower to sync than phones (I have no idea why, they just do). When the outlook client sees a new email come in it puts that email in the default folder group (Personal folders, Mailbox, Archive, etc). This can be changed in outlook (2003) by selecting tools> email accounts> view/change accounts> then there is a drop down labeled "deliver email to the following location:" This will have all the folder groups listed.
