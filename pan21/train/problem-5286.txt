The data link between the motherboard and the actual SD-card reader could be the culprit, but so could the SD-card reader itself be. This meaning that if the data link is slower than the data link between the USB-device, then you're going to get a slower performance. Other factors could depend on features such as write-cache, but such elements would usually be bypassed by benchmarking software.
On the first hunch, such a problem would be attributed to the fact that an internal SD-card reader is just another device; to you, such a device may seem as an integrated part of the system, but only in the sense that it's a part of the casing/tower/notebook.
The thing is you are talking about two different connections.  One USB the other PCI and although PCI supports bus mastering the chances are your built in SD reader was made to function at a standard pci speed similar to the mode 1-4 settings of old parallel hard drives(before they were DMA). Thing is most built in devices on laptops are poor or standard, often the wiring and other attachments are flimsy(look at the keyboard of a laptop). The main reasons being weight kept to a minimum. Those speeds look almost like a USB 1 external hard drive and a usb 2 Ext' HDD's speeds. But keep an eye on that usb reader if its as cheap as the one I had use insulation tape too hold on the outer caseing
Firstly, I'd like to make a note that only speculation can be done on the basis of the slightly vague question of yours.
It depends on the internals of your laptop. The internal card reader might be connected to a slower usb bus than the usb port of the external card reader.
