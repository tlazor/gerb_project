An MMO server has more load. A multiplayer racing game might run fine with 10 people connected, but will crash and burn if the server gets unresponsive under heavy load from hundreds of users.
You have to deal with network latency and syncing the game state across the network. The faster the cars move the more notable the network latency becomes. Players might crash into a wall, because their game client fails to update the game state on the server due to network issues. Which isn't an issue when players move at walk speed ;-)
Garry's Mod is pretty much all physics. I don't think it counts as an MMO as such - though it will support 32 players per server - and that has the most realistic physics I've seen (not just vehicles). 
They tried to accomplish this in a major fail of a game called all points bulletin. Well the concept was great the execution not so much.  Random cars would appear out of nowhere.  You would be driving and just hit a wall which would then turn into a car.  I can see it being done somehow in the next five years though more cpu less gpu.
