I run Vmware with some virtual machines, but as you know, if the OS fail, I would lose all of them, so, there´s only a solution: Installing a hypervisor type 1 over the hardware ( bare metal ), and then, installing everything again, so, if my Win7 got a problem, it will not cause problems on the other virtual machines. I would like to know if there´s a way to install the type 1 WITHOUT uninstalling my whole windows or formating the physical machine. 
There´s many hypervisors. I was thinking about ESXi, what do you think ? The problem with ESXi is that ( may be ) I would need an external laptop to control it. I know that windows server 2012 has an Hyper V bare metal, but Win7 has nothing ( only Win8 has ). So, do I need to format my machine and install everything again, or at least can I make a copy of the complete OS and import afterwards as a new virtual machine to the new system ?
As you may know, hypervisors type 1 are called bare metal, and are intimate to the hardware. Hypervisors type 2 may be installed over an operating system, to run virtual machines ( like VMware workstation ). The problem is that I already run a Windows 7 in my physical machine, with dozens of software installed and I don´t want to lose them by formating...
