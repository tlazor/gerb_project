Pinging is for machines not for doamins (who should answer the pinged domain?). I don't know your exact domain name but here is what is probably happening.
As Igal mentioned above, the reason that ping works against the FQDN is because of the round-robin A-records of domain controllers.
EDIT: Actually, this only works if your AD domain is in 3 parts or more. I can get it working on one of domains who are named "lan.domain.com", but not a domain called "domain.local".
your machine query the dns form mydomain and fail then try to append the domain name so it query for
I've checked DNS and that seems to be fine. We are not using WINS - but internet searching seems to indicate that is only needed when trying to ping a NETBIOS name across different subnets - we are not doing that.
I've got some general slight network errors on a network. As part of testing I've discovered that I can't ping the netbios name of the site.
Try pinging the fqdn of your domain. mydomain.local, or whatever it is. That should work. If you're not running wins, it won't know how to find the netbios name just like you mentioned. 
The reason that pinging directly for mydomain.com is that you have an a record in your dns for the address mydomain.com.
Your local machine query the dns for hosta ( and fail) then try to append the domain name so it query for hosta.mydomain.com and every thing is fine.
I'm guessing that your DNS suffix isnt correct on the client you're using ping from, as it fails to guess wich TLD "mydomain" is under. Please run ipconfig /all and double-check "DNS Suffix Search List".
and faile again. You local machine should not ( and does not) append the top level domain (e.g com org) to the dns query.
