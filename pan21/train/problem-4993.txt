I would personally start with a Windows 2003 environment (if you are wanting to go the MS IT Pro route) and add a few Win2008 servers as well in the mix.  That will help you be "current" and still ensure that you can support most of what is still out there.
Funny, I recently wrote an article about this on my blog (Getting Started in Information Technology is Easy).
Finally, I'd recommend reading books if you are a reader.  Books I'd recommend for general knowledge are:
This is an excellent resource for beginners to understand TCP/IP, fundamental networking skills like subnetting, vlans, routing, etc.  Regardless of if you use Cisco equipment or not
Emulate what you learn at the MS virtual labs in your own test environment, creating a domain and adding servers to it that perform various roles.
Find someone (friend, co-worker) who needs something done or can at least act like a customer.  Because until you have someone else making demands of your time needing their problem(s) fixed or their project(s) implemented, you won't get the understanding of what a sysadmin may spend a good part of their day doing.
I found this one to be more of a refresher for me, but I've had friends new to sysadmin stuff that found it a wealth of knowledge.  Great information and a ton of great ideas and concepts.  A worthy read
This book is simply amazing...way in depth but a worthy read to fully understand wireless, which is very important nowadays
The only real way to learn sysadmin skills is to play with things. Set up mail servers, dns servers, webservers, anything you can. The more you experiment with things, the more you'll learn.
