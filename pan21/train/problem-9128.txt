You can also specify the --host and --port of the MongoDB instance that the mongodump should connect to. For example:
Changed in version 3.2.1: The backup role provides additional privileges to back up the system.profile collections that exist when running with database profiling. Previously, users required an additional read access on this collection.
The data format used by mongodump from version 2.2 or later is incompatible with earlier versions of mongod. Do not use recent versions of mongodump to back up older data stores.
To limit the amount of data included in the database dump, you can specify --db and --collection as options to mongodump. For example:
To run mongodump against a MongoDB deployment that has access control enabled, you must have privileges that grant find action for each database to back up. The built-in backup role provides the required privileges to perform backup of any and all databases.
To backup data from a mongod or mongos instance running on the same machine and on the default port of 27017, use the following command:
When you run mongodump without any arguments, the command connects to the MongoDB instance on the local system (e.g. 127.0.0.1 or localhost) on port 27017 and creates a database backup named dump/ in the current directory.
The utility can create a backup for an entire server, database or collection, or can use a query to backup just part of a collection.
mongodump overwrites output files if they exist in the backup data folder. Before running the mongodump command multiple times, either ensure that you no longer need the files in the output folder (the default is the dump/ folder) or rename the folders or files.
This operation creates a dump of the collection named myCollection from the database test in a dump/ subdirectory of the current working directory.
