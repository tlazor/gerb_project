In terms of GPT itself, the extra partitions you're seeing are not necessary; a GPT disk with just one partition is perfectly legal. (Even one with no partitions is legal, but pretty useless until you add partitions, of course.) I can't guarantee that Seagate isn't doing something weird with extra software or drivers that might require those partitions, though.
This example is of one of my Linux disks. The most important data for your question is under the Code column, which shows gdisk's internal coding for the partition type codes. You can see what the codes are by typing L at the main prompt. Codes you're most likely to see are EF00 (ESP), 0700 (Microsoft filesystem data), 0C01 (Microsoft reserved), and 2700 (Windows Recovery Environment). The codes used on your mystery partitions might provide a clue about what they're for. If the code is FFFF, that means that gdisk doesn't recognize what it is, which in turn means it's probably something Seagate-specific.
It's possible to convert from GPT to MBR with any number of tools. Windows is supposed to have such a feature, but if it's not working for you, I can't advise on how to fix it. I can say that gdisk has a lossless GPT-to-MBR function:
I don't know why Seagate has shipped its drives like this, but my guess is that the three smaller partitions contain Seagate software of some sort. It's possible that one of them is an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is used as part of the boot process on EFI computers. You might learn a little more by looking at the disk with my gdisk program. (A version is available for Windows, or you can use a Linux emergency disk.) Its output will look something like this:
