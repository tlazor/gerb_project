In extreme conditions we could have 400 simultaneous users, 1,200 across the 16 critical hours in the day.
3.Is the disk topology optimal for the combination of servers and disks (I have some spare 300GB 10K, 147GB 15K and 72GB 15K disks). Might I be better with two RAID 1 arrays in place of the 1+0 array and split off Data/Logs/TempDB?
In general I think you're right to spend so much time confirming the build before proceeding but it certainly looks like you've thought this through in detail and already have a good config. Good luck.
For financial reasons we are limited to Windows 2003 and SQL Server 2005 to host Windows SharePoint Services v3, I am looking at the disk topology at the moment and a little unsure if I have got it right. I would appreciate any thoughts.
According to Jimmy May the following two functions should equal a natural (positive integer) number.
You only have room for 6 disks in this box so you don't have a ton of options. Certainly mirroring the OS is good so what to do with the other 4? You really only have 2 options and you've already picked the first one. As you suggested, two mirror sets to separate logs and db would also work. I would usually advocate separating the logs and db but that's generally assuming you can mirror the logs and build a bigger RAID10 set for the db. You don't have enough disks to do that so I think more spindles in one RAID10 is better than two mirrors and would leave it as it is.
Likely yes but its hard to say. 400 users viewing a few pages is easy. 400 users uploading content and doing other intensive stuff might be an issue. In general, I think you've got a satisfactory solution to start with.
