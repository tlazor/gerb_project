I have also heard of "pl2bat", but no idea if that would keep the CLI alive whilst rest of program run.
I developed several scripts using the command line in windows (which is needed because there are several 'say' comments that need to be shown) and using the line:
I then wondered about batch files, but they appears to close the window once batch has run, so won't be able to display the say commands!
You should be able to do this with a standard .BAT file containing the perl script. To preserve the CMD window put the pause command after the perl script.
That opens the command line, and sets the prompt to "D:/path to script_" (I also tried adding perl in between the two arguemennts as per when typing directly into window. That had no effect) I tried "perl D:/path to script" in quotes. That didn't work
This morning I created a series of shortcuts on Windows, the basic idea being they can click on the icon, and the CMD will open and start running the script. THAT is where I'm stuck !
This is running client side, and NOT in browser, or sending data to a server, the idea being with Perl on a USB stick, it will be 'self contained' with nothing being installed on PC
