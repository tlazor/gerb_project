One of our company's Apache/PHP/MySQL driven sites is being moved to a new server. It is not yet moved to production, so there are only two users or so. Still, loading a page using the database can take several seconds.
If no-one can see anything obvious from there, I suppose I'll have to start timing individual queries and portions of the code.
As an example: 13.8s at the first page load, and 0.01-0.02s on subsequent page loads. That's on a page with 30 queries.
It looks as if your tables are in innodb - looking at what you've published here, there are problems with your config. Assuming this a dedicated DB server, and not using MyISAM then you need a much bigger innodb_buffer_pool_size (not shown in metrics quoted?)
I suppose some kind of MySQL cache is involved, but my main problem is: why is the initial load so enormously slow? Can anything be diagnosed from this? Especially, there are some large numbers in the MySQL SHOW STATUS output that worry me. 
First thing to check is that name resolving is disabled, and authentication  is done based on IP address, not name. This can introduce huge latency for query operations.
Yes, running a query directly against the data on disk is much, much slower than fetching it from the query cache - a large proportion of your queries are being resolved from the Query cache, but making it any bigger is not going to have a huge impact. 
Whether your query performance is the issue will be evident from your slow query log - if you're using anything less than 5.1, upgrade your DB so you can set a slow query threshold of 0 seconds (i.e. everything gets logged) and start using mysqldumpslow to analyse the data.
