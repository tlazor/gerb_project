If that still fails, you need to ensure Memory Exeuction Prevenetion is also disabled in the target XP's box.
iF THAT still fails, then push the VNC paCkage to an XP FW disabled target and use an IP <==> exe utility to model what is happening such as TCPview.exe (go look it up) to model which ports are being used.
XP Firewall is fairly unreliable bugger and it's rule / exemption set should still be considered BETA. Combiend with the fact you're using officially unsupported and freely available VNC for remote access is enough ingredients for a heaping bowl of frustration soup.
Also enable FWQ logging at the target XP system to capture successfula nd failed connection attempts the PUSH VNC client is attempting.
Assuming this fails after you've also tried enabling 5800 and 5900 UDP, you should next define the names of the executables as part of the target XP's firewall profile.
Then, create your exemption rule from a the observed ports and used exe's and use that data to create your XP FW exemption ruleset and push it using any method from a regedit or a TELNET session.
