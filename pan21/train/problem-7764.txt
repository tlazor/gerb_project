If you don't mind my asking what is the application?  You could do as Kevin suggested and use mstsc /console OR mstsc /admin depending on your service pack level to connect directly to console.  Another option is turning it into a service.  I'm not sure if you have it running in a console window because you want to be able to see some output, which would negate this - but there are several apps that will package any app as a service.  Another option is to remote desktop over to that machine using another account, then take over the administrator session.
Substitute the correct values for $myProcessName and $myProgram with your program's info.  The process name is typically the same as the file name, without the .exe, but check Task Manager to be sure.  Save that to a file, scriptName.PS1, and run that when you logon.  This could be in the Start Menu > Startup folder, or numerous other locations that you prefer.  You need to enable running PowerShell scripts if you have not already done that, or you will get an error.
Have you tried using the /console switch with mstsc?  This should force it to connect to the console session.
One note - to see all the running processes on the server, you need administrator permissions, which the user account you are using seems to have.
if (get-process $myProcessName -ea SilentlyContinue) {} else {[diagnostics.process]::start($myProgram)}
