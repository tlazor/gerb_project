Other heuristics could be ammo user fires at said enemy (hard to track). User movement while fighting an enemy (measure if they are working harder/dodging more against this enemy type).
Ways to improve this could be to rank the various heuristics the damage an enemy does is ranked higher than enemy lifetime.
This is a good concept that is not in enough games. The best way to implement this would be to use both of your strategies. Concerning your first strategy I wouldn't be too worried about a player exploiting it because if they let an enemy damage them then they still took damage so they can't do that exploit forever. I still think your second strategy concerning multiple enemies in conjunction is important I'll give the following example. If you have a large "tank" enemy with low DPS and a sniper enemy that hides behind with high DPS the two of them could be a big problem where separately they were weak.
Suggested Improvements for Strat 2 I would suggest something like swapping out one enemy per level (evolution cycle) and keeping them in reserve, measuring that wave and determining if it did better or worse without that enemy. Cycle out other enemy types next round and measure again.
