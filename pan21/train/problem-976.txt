Yes, changing the ownership of the filesystem tree rooted in /media/pi/storage/root_folder/ to (the user under which Apache Httpd runs, generally apache) should work as long as the user can access that filesystem tree (i.e. it must be able to "execute" the directories media, pi and storage.
And finally, how do I get these permissions to be applied for any new subdirectories and files in the future so that I don't run into the same forbidden error ever again?
under section virtual hosts, I created a test html at /home/pi/Desktop/ and it works because of correct permissions.
This is what I'm trying to do: change the default directory of apache2 from /var/www/html to /media/pi/storage/root_folder/
Now when I do the exact same thing at /media/pi/storage/root_folder/ and reload the webpage, I get forbidden error message, suggesting that I have permission issues on my hard drive.
to change the SELinux context of the files under /media/pi/storage/root_folder (I'm not SELinux guru, but that works for me).
