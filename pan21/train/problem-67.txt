Authentication in OSPF prevents an attacker who can sniff and inject packets to fool routers and modify OSPF topology. Results are for example: possible of MITM when attacker changes the topology in such way that certain/all traffic flows through machine controlled by him. Denial of service when the attacker discards traffic which flows through him. Another result could be meltdown of all routers when attacker announces new information very rapidly, although this could be partially solved by tuning SPF timers.
I know that to secure OSPF you should 1) use OSPF authentication, 2) use passive interface command on interfaces that do not have ospf neighbors.  If I only use the passive interface command and not ospf authentication, what vulnerabilities am I left open to?
It depends on your network topology. If the non-passive links are isolated (point-to-point) and secured at lower layers of the stack (physical access control of the routers), then I would be hard pressed to identify a viable attack vector. Authentication is critical when it is possible for a rogue router to present arbitrary traffic on a given link.
If we make an assumption that your layers 1-3 are secure than OSPF authentication doesn't make any sense. But because layer 1-3 are not necessarily secure OSPF employs it's own security method - authentication.
Authentication also prevents replay attacks, for example it prevents attacker from advertising expired information from past. Also it prevents mayhem by plugging a router from another network with existing OSPF configuration which could inject overlapping routes for example (thanks to this, authentication is good even if you have your layer 1-3 secured).
OSPFv2 only supports authentication. You can still see the LSAs payload even if you use authentication. The only thing authentication does is authenticate neighbors. There is no payload encryption.
