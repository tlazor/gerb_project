I would strongly suggest to use a unique SSID for your network. Bear in mind that others can read this name, so it should not be an indication of to where you live, so burgulars won't have a clue where people live that have computers.
Also, Dlink, linksys etc routers often do use their name, but always have a small additive, such as Linksys-15326 which is unique.
Do note that if you make a connection and then move closer to your neighbours wifi, things will keep working until you actually get out of range of your own wifi, in which case it will try to switch and fail then, prompting you with an enter password dialog.
This can cause problems. Because there are 2 networks with the same name, you will only see one wifi network. Depending on which of the two networks is closer at the moment of connecting, thats the network that your device is trying to connect to using the password. If it is closer to your neighbours network, it will simply fails to connect and likely asks you to type in your password.
