You don't need to run it, but it's a really good idea.  The problem is, if your computer crashes, your operating system doesn't have a chance to cleanly unmount the file system.  So the file system may no longer be consistent.  Inconsistent file systems can lead to significant problems.  You may lose files.  You may have cross-linked files (edit one file and its contents end up in another).  That sort of thing.  If you don't deal with these issues, all bets are off.
The disk check happens because XP detects the filesystem was not cleanly dismounted (due to the crash).  Disabling it is not recommended.
The Wikipedia entry on fsck goes into a little bit more detail on why you need to check file system integrity, albeit from the perspective of Unix and Linux operating systems.
If your C: drive currently takes up the entirety of the hard drive, this is why the check takes so long.  You could optimize it by shrinking the system partition (C:) to a bare-minimum size and storing all data on a separate partition.  Depending on the programs you have installed, bare-minimum would be anywhere from 5GB to 30GB.  
However, I'm curious at your comment that it takes half an hour.  Are you running NTFS or FAT32?  If you are running FAT32, switch to NTFS.  NTFS is a journalled file system.  Among other things, that means that it should be considerably faster to check the consistency of the file system after a crash.  When Vista crashes on me, it takes less than a couple of minutes to check my 1.5 TB NTFS partition, unless things have gone hideously wrong.
What you're looking to do is disable Scandisk on boot. That can be done through a registry modification - from Microsoft Help and Support:
