If it makes any difference, I'm using Fedora 24, and dhclient is launched/managed by NetworkManager.
Your router is simply using the information your device makes available to show you the best possible name for the machine.  
Yes, I know there's no technical reason to give my at-home desktop a static hostname, nor for the router to display a different hostname.  I'm just weird and finicky about such things.
I'm using an at-home-type wireless router as the DHCP server for my desktop, with said router's management console showing the host names of the connected machines.  If I put send host-name "AAA"; into dhclient.conf and my desktop has no static hostname then the router will show the hostname as "AAA".  However, if I then set the desktop's static hostname to "BBB" the router will show the hostname as "BBB", even though I want to stay as "AAA".  I tried using send dhcp-client-identifier "AAA";, but that confused the router so much it forgets any hostname and just shows the desktop's MAC address.
Since the information you provide mismatches, it knows it is unreliable and decides to only show the information that is verified: the MAC address.
There is absolutely no case where this should be a source of worry or take more than 2 seconds of your time.
