So the problem I want to find a tidy solution for is that when I log into a server (I have some Solaris and RHEL instances about), I try to find out what applications are running:
If what I'm asking sounds impossible/silly/completely-off-his-rocker, I am open to alternate solutions that give me some ability to accomplish the same thing.  I'm open for ideas, but this one popped up as being doable.
The solution I'd like to provide is during my start-up scripts, I'd like to prepend or append to a process some text that lets me throw a short description in.  Is there anything that might let me do this?
And I get a nice list of processes, PIDs, extra details, and with the entire process name and parameters that executed with it.  While this generally provides enough information for me to find out what is running, some servers are run differently.  I might have a server that has multiple instances of an app server used for different purposes.  Other processes are remnants of a hung process that I have mixed with non-frozen processes.  I don't want to shut down all java instances because I can't find out which process needs killing.
