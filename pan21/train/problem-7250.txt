After doing some research, I found out that Test Disk recreates the partition tables of many disk formats, which work when a drive is deleted. You have to choose the Intel partition format. If Linux file systems were previously residing, they too will be recovered, but you can delete and merge them with EaseUs partition manager.
My question is this. Is there any way to change the deleted partition back to NTFS without having to have a drive that you need to recover the files to and then move them back after formatting, as I don’t have any space left on either the computer or on my other external hard drive, so that I don’t need to buy a new one. The files on the disk were really important.
Recently, I accidentally deleted a partition off of my external hard disk. I had a copy of Minitool Power Data Recovery left over when the same drive had become RAW about a year ago. When I selected lost partition recovery, it immediately identified my deleted partition and allowed me to access and recover the files that were there.
