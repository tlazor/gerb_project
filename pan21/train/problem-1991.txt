Another way to turn off animations in Office 2013, which does NOT involve going into the registry, is as follows (quoted from Excel 2013 built-in help):
Copy the following text in the notepad and rename the file as .reg  and then open the and merge the entry. 
It appears to be a global setting unfortunately. You can disable it by going to Control Panel, Ease of Access Center, then click Make it easier to focus on tasks, and tick Turn off unnecessary animations. It will disable many other Windows animations though.
3.Under Adjust time limits and flashing visuals, click Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible).
Office 2013 is the first release to use hardware acceleration throughout the user experience to deliver beautiful, fluid animations. But if you use your computer without a display or just prefer to block unnecessary animations, you have the choice to turn them off.
