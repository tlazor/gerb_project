Internally what Minecraft calls things like fences and walls having a different shape is just the block's "extended state" where extra data gets used to render the block model.
While for other blocks, data encoded in the "extended sate," such as the exact height of each corner of a liquid block, is only used for rendering as it only affects the displayed graphical representation. This allows blocks like water and lava to have a steadily decreasing height slope rather than stair-step like (as snow layers does).
I'm not aware of any special name for this technique. Nothing I can think of calling it is returning any meaningful results.
I do know that when the texture is different (not the block shape) based on the surrounding blocks it got called "connected textures" (due to the first time that a mod did that in Minecraft it was called Connected Textures).
For some blocks its encoded in the "actual state" (where the non-adjective "state" is the Block+Metadata combination), which handles states based on information encoded in the world (such as neighboring blocks or TileEntity data). Fences and walls do this to indicate what sides they're connected on and that can be queried server-side by other code (e.g. other blocks).
