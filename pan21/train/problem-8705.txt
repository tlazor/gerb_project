Last check is routing. Many sub-netted networks do not allow packets to travel between "client" subnets, only from client to "server" subnets and then out to the world.  Can someone on the same subnet connect to you? Can you connect to others on other subnets?  Routing issues typically give a different error message (no route to host)
First issue is did something change on your end ? No longer listening on your LAN address and only on localhost, etc.  New firewall policy being pushed down by domain controller/etc?  
You likely have a corporate proxy server that all web browsers are configured to use. This proxy server likely caches resources and prevents users going to sites they don't want you to use, such as email, dropbox, etc.
Then you would be looking at addressing.  Does yourcomputername.company.com still resolve to the address your computer actually has?  Does it resolve that way on other computers?  IE, things could be great BUT that name is resolving to the wrong address... Errors would be "can't find server named ..." or "dns resolution" if the name isn't look-up-able at all and you'd need to check what address it does resolve to separately...
Note that some or all of these are likely to violate some corporate policies. You should ensure you have appropriate authorization before doing any of them.
My best guess is they changed the settings on the proxy server, or changed the proxy configuration, so it no longer routes requests locally.
The best answer is "ask your network administrator", however I have an idea what the issue could be.
I normally do not like referring people to the next person in the chain, but this REALLY needs to go through your company IT dept. If they pushed out the changes, you will likely not be able to change them back without their assistance.
