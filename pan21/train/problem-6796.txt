First of all, I do find this a bit odd: by default, zsh uses emacs-style (escape followed by a key) key combos, unless it is in vi-mode, at which point emacs-style key combos are disabled. zsh also puts itself in vi mode if you use a vi-like editor as your default editor. So, it would seem to me that you were probably not originally in vi mode, until you edited your zshenv. 
First of all, the inclusion of the "vicmd" bit prevents this from working in insert (normal) mode: it only works if you first press escape (by itself) to leave insert mode for command mode (as you would do in vim). So, you can't press "esc-/" as a chord (try pressing escape, releasing it, then pressing "/"). 
Or, maybe I'm wrong completely, and I should just focus on your bind statement, which is incorrectly written. 
It may be that you really would be better off in emacs mode (bindkey -e). On the other hand, it may be that you'd like to be in vi mode, but would be better off with some emacs style bindings.
So, I would first ask: are you 100% sure you have always been using vi mode? That is to say, does bindkey -e solve your issue (try it in an open shell)?
This works well when you are using 'vi mode' in ZSH, but I recently added vim as my default editor in my .zshenv file. Now when I press "/", I see this:
