You can verify if there are inbound security rules denying the rdp traffic in the network security group in you VM virtual network.

it would appear that since i was a contractor and not assigned to the correct VLAN in the office, i could not RDP outside.....
I am consulting for a company for a azure migration project. For some reason, even though I have confirmed with several sources, I have been tasked with proving that I can create a VM on the on-prem Hyper-V server without licensing it and then copy that VHD to Azure and create a VM from it. I will spare you the steps that I have followed to get it up to the cloud, it is pretty basic. What I am facing now is that once I have created the snapshot and disk and spun up the VM, I get ZERO outbound network traffic. Meaning I am unable to connect via RDP. I have tried just about everything under the sun. I even went back on-prem to see if there was an issue with the NIC there....NOPE, I am able to get out to internet and everything.
If anyone could assist with this, maybe have some leading questions that would point me somewhere I haven't thought of yet, that'd be great!
