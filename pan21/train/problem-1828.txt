It seems to me Q1000's wifi function is to broadcast the wifi signal out instead of receiving signal. 
The obvious solution is I go buy that little USB dongle which can receive wifi and plug it to the desktop. But before doig that, I am wondering if somehow I can re-use the Q1000 modem. 
The modem has 4 LAN ports and it has wifi antenna. I tried connecting the desktop to Q1000's LAN port, the system shows wire connection is in place, but I cannot access internet.
Anyway, maybe this thing cannot be used in this fashion. If you have any suggestion, please shed some light.
I used to use DSL for my home internet and used Qwest Q1000 wireless modem. Now I switched to cable and use wireless router to cover the home. One problem is I just bought a desktop and I like to put it in a place far away from the router. The desktop only has cable interface, it does not receive wifi. 
I went to the Q1000 configuration page by going to web page of "192.168.0.1", it is not clear how to set it up. I also wonder one thing, my home wifi is encrypted, so if I want to let Q1000 to join the wifi, I need to somehow type in the password, I am not sure how to do that either.
