Now, if you check SQL Server build numbers, yours are OUTDATED. Current is 13.0.5216.0, September 21 2018. Yours is an update August 2017. Not even current service pack level. Definitely needs patching, and definitely needs a separate system to validate. I generally make it a rule to update quarterly minimum.
I have one server for data warehousing, and it has 2 instances of SSAS (SQL SERVER Analysis Services).
Where can I find information about the costs of licensing involved for a small server just to run a SSAS instance?
At the same place you find the cost of licensing SQL Server in general, as it is part of SQL Server.
Then learn them. Most people find databases confiusing, you still can learn them. As a development lead (or whatever) tasked with that - it is your job to know your way around those. I would suggest taking some months off and looking into an alternative career in medicine or law - THEN you will start looking at stuff that is "not so clear and sometimes contradictory". IT is actually trivial if you spend some time in it, even licensing, compared to becoming a lawyer. Part of the job. And we can not help you - licensing costs MAY well be company specific depending what programs you are in.
The data warehouses are not that big, less that 200GB, and I backup the whole thing on a daily basis.
At the notion of sounding sarcastic, I will actually answer the qeustion you DO ask. Note that Licensing specifics are off topic here, so the answer is general.
I find licensing costs a tricky topic sometimes, with not-so-clear or contradictory information around.
