This is also a good indication that the application does NOT require elevated permissions to run. Applications do not have write permissions in the Program Files folders unless you click to Allow the program to “make changes to your computer,” during installation.
Applications that install for only one user do this. This usually includes programs that give you an option to install for “this user only” or “all users” of this computer. The former is installed under AppData - for one specific user. 
For these reasons, it is perfectly normal for an application like this to install under AppData. It is designed for one specific user, and does not require elevated permissions to function.
Another interesting fact is that the application will only show up under your user account when viewing the “Programs & Features” listing. As a systems admin, you may notice that “non-admin” users have certain applications installed and showing up in the “Programs & Features” list. You may immediately question how that user was able to install software on the computer. But, the reasons above are why. It did not require admin permissions. If the admin then logs in, they will NOT see the application in their programs listing. The application has to also be uninstalled by the same user who installed it. This can be a source of confusion as some applications can be installed simultaneously for one user account and system-wide for all user accounts.
