i had the same problem, I decided to look at the public key for the root user, it had the following appearance "rsa-ssh YOUR KEY name of .pem file" in one line, the public key generated by the putty from .pem for the new user looked different: the comments and the key were written in about 6 lines when I edited the putty key as root and copied it in /nome/nevuser/.ssh/authorizade_key it work
I am facing the issue in connecting server via putty. The error is showing me is "Server Refused our key: AWS - Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available (server sent:publickey)".
I am logging in with username " ubuntu ".I checked lots of websites but I didn't find any solution. I create a new key-pair file( .pem ) and tried again that's also is not working.
You have an EC2 instance it looks like, follow the instructions above to create a key pair for this instance. A PEM file is a form of password that is shared by only those who have the files configured. You have to create this on the EC2 instance in Amazon, so the EC2 knows that those who connect with this file are authorized, and then download it to your own computer, and convert it to something Putty can use. 
When we convert your .pem file to .ppk it creates a public and private key of it's own inside the .ppk file like this: 
To connect to the server, you need to append the six lines of public key above into authorized_keys file in server user's /home/.ssh directory.
I am using the same key name for the pem file. Then using pem file I am creating a ppk  file and then it is not working
Then, determine what operating system your EC2 instance is using. Depending on what it is, you will use a different user, for example with Ubuntu, the user is ubuntu, or Amazon Linux, the user is ec2.
