Remember that VLANs are layer 2 concepts, while IP subnets are layer 3 concepts. In most cases, there is a one to one correspondence between them -- one IP subnet per VLAN and vice versa.
On Cisco switches, VLAN 1 is used for management protocols, such as STP, CDP, and DTP.  These can be exploited in some cases by an attacker so it's safer to keep user traffic off of it.  Only you can determine if the risk is worth the effort.
Typically, you would use a security control that operates at layer 3, such as an access list, to allow only specific networks or hosts to access the phones' control panels.  You would apply the ACL at a layer 3 boundary (i.e. the default gateway for that subnet).  In most networks, the layer 3 boundary is also the layer 2 boundary (VLAN interface, SVI, etc.).
So by separating your network into VLANs, you have also separated it into IP subnets, which allows you to apply access control lists on the VLAN interfaces.  You can create an access control list and apply in on the VLAN 2 interface that only allows certain hosts to access the control panels.
