Your post only got my attention because it contains chromebook or another Chrome OS specific keyword on certain StackExchange sites. Chromebooks modified to run Windows is a very unusual case and therefore it's no surprise that other users will come up with recommendations that may not work for you. That's your mistake for not being explicitly clear about the situation from the start but putting this important information somewhere at the end. If you discover bug related to this kind of chromebook modification then the folks at r/chrultrabook are the only ones I know of who may have enough knowledge to help you out.
Use Windows' disk manager to resize the partition, if it refuses to do it then you have to reinstall or use dism (as Bob suggested in chat). More commands like bcdboot and reagentc may be required to run for troubleshooting instead of simply reinstalling, I tinkered with this on another problem here but at the moment I don't have a Windows booting chromebook nor sufficient time available to recreate your issue and look into it (to eventually learn something).
