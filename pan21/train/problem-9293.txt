Be warned: Using any such software may result in irrecoverable data loss. Most times out of ten it works, however.
The question is, how I can log-in with another user? (Administrator) Why this windows has not switch user button? 
The only sure fire fix is to remove the hard disk, install a new hard disk, install Windows 7 and attach the old disk to the new installed win 7 and read your files into the new install.
I have windows 7 installed on my system. this is my log-on screen. I forgot this account's password. 
The Administrator account is disabled by default in Windows Vista onwards. This is why you create an account when you first turn the computer on from new. Did you create a password reset disk? if not then you will need to use a reset tool like Offline NT Password & Registry Editor that can be put on a bootable CD or USB and you can blank or change your user account password. The Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) has this tool.
IIRC there is an Administrator account that may be dormant, and it may be possible to activate it in Safe Mode, but again, what then is the purpose of the password?
If you were to be able to access the account without knowing the password, as in I forgot the password, then what is the purpose of the password?
