From a user machine with user's userid and password, I cannot see the folders or files, but the shortcut which accesses those files via an application works correctly, so the files are accessible.
I inherited an SBS2008 server which had a corrupt or otherwise lost userid which was used to setup redirects, etc.
SO, I THINK THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO MAKE THE FILES COPIED TO THE WINDOWS 7 MACHINE VISIBLE, ESTABLISH A WORKING SYSTEM, AND THEN GO FROM THERE.
Unfortunately, the previous person (who is no longer here) was not taking backups, so I am in a precarious position.
I've changed the hidden attribute and the owner of the folders and files copied to the Windows 7 machine, but they are still not visible.
Now, I cannot see the redirected folders. Using TreeSize Pro, I can see the folders and their contents.
Using TreeSize Pro, I can copy the folders, sudb-folders, and files to a Windows 7 Pro computer, but even on this computer, I cannot see the files except through TreeSize.
I THINK I NEED TO MAKE THE FILES COPIED TO THE WINDOWS 7 PRO MACHINE VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE, so that I can see what I have, determine if I can run apps against them etc. - So that I can then reload SBS2008 from scratch and set everything up correctly.
The application is mission critical and cannot be down for more than an hour or two and corrupting the data (without access to a proper backup) would be a disaster! Since I don't have proper backups (except what I could copy using TreeSize), I'm afraid to do surgery on the SBS 2008 machine to make the files visible.
