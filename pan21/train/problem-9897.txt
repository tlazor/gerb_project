What I would like to know now are the best practices in managing that root password. Should I change it periodicaly? And how do I share that new password with the sysadmins?
My Notes about sudo: (PLEASE NOTE - my notes are just my collection from our very own google only. i post them because it may help newbies, slow-learners like me;).. if you say the info isnt correct, or just a copy from wiki, or plagiarism, blah blah blah, then let me know thru a comment, i would be very happy to delete my post, than your down-votes )
There is one condition where you actually need the root password: if a filesystem is fails fsck when booting, you will typically be prompted to enter the root password to obtain a shell prompt where you can repair the damage.  At that point, neither regular user accounts nor SSH will be available.  If the sysadmin doesn't know the root password, then the only other option would be to boot from alternate media.
To list the home directory of user yazza on a machine where the filesystem holding ~yazza is not exported as root:
We have just deployed a couple of Linux server. Each sysadmin will have his own account on the server (i.e.: jsmith), and will connect using SSH with a certificate which will be put into the "authorized_keys" file in their home directory. Once connected on the server, if they want to issue an elevated command, they will do like:
If they are using sudo, then it will ask for their password and not root password, therefore no root password change needed. Just be sure to give them proper privileges in /etc/sudoers file.
