As jpx_ said, in Windows 8 the default browser becomes Metro. To change your default browser back to IE, open the Start Screen, type "Default," click the "settings" filter on the right, click "Default Programs," on the left hand side of the Default Programs window, select "Internet Explorer" and then select "Set this program as default"
If it doesn't change at this point, go to the three bars at the top right of your Chrome browser and select "Relaunch Chrome from Desktop".  This should work now that you're in administrator mode.   You can take it one step further and repin the shortcut to your task bar.
purkki is right. The default browser will run in metro and any other browsers will get switched to desktop mode.  I choose the option to start Chrome in metro and I no longer had controls or anything in there.  I couldn't choose to switch back.  So I made IE the default browser and it switched Chrome back for me so it was useable again.  You can then choose Chrome as your default again if you so desire and it will stay in desktop mode unless you make the same mistake again with the 'start in windows 8 mode.'
I feel your pain.  This got me so frustrated!  The whole reason I've stuck with PC is because of its sense of structure.
