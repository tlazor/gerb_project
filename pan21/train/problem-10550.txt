If I print more than onepage, Windows will print page 1 and 2 on one sheet and pages 1 and 2 again in the other sheet... even if I choose not to collate!
Since I assume you're using Windows' built-in printing panel you may want to update your system, or Office if you're using it.
Just to expand Ecnerwal's answer, you can try specifying the number of extra copies (1 in this case) while you have the two-sided printing enabled and by printing only the page you want to be copied (by specifying it manually). Something like this:
I have tried several things, but Windows always prints a different page for the second copy even if I select print two sided.
This might as well be an issue with your drivers. Update or reinstall them, your machine is either using a generic driver (hence why it can't use the two-sided printing feature correctly) or the one you already have is buggy.
I haven't used Adobe reader for years, but Foxit reader (www.foxitsoftware.com) which I use has a print box similar to Office, where you can specify a page list, so you simply specify 1,1,2,2.... That works perfectly with double-sided printing.
