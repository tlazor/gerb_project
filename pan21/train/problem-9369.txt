How do I do it? Simply create ifcfg-br0 as per https://www.banym.de/linux/centos/setup-bridge-device-on-centos (with its own unique IP address), and simply add a line to my ifcfg-em1.144 file which says BRIDGE=br0?
True, I could simply try it and see, but at this point I am so unsure about how it all comes together that I'd like to perform a sanity check before I get a sanity wreck :-) .
...and I have a ifcfg-em1.144 that has all the IP addressing in it and such. I have installed a plurality of VMs on the box. Now I need to make the network work.
I'm not sure how to configure my Linux server which has a single VLAN'ed interface to support a number of Virtual machines which I want to bridge to my network (so that all their services appear to come from a number of real machines on my network). Do I simply create a single bridged network interface br0, tied to my existing VLAN'ed device, and have all the VMs use that interface? Or do I need to set up br0, br1, br2, etc. for each VM? Can I even tie those bridge interfaces to a VLAN'ed interface? I suppose I need to say VLAN="yes" in the bridge's ifcfg file?
