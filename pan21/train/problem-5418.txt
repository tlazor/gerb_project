Well, now I've reinstalled Server 2008 R2 and it refuses to update.  I've gotten a few different errors.  Googling them usually gives me Vista pages suggesting that I rename the updates folder, restart services, etc.  I've tried all of this without luck.  I've tried manually updating .net, I've tried manually installing service pack 1(it says its already installed), I've tried updating with the stock nic drivers and the drivers which came with the system, I've tried teaming the nics(load balancing mode) and also leaving them unteamed.  I also tried an "update readiness" package.  Nothing has helped.
So I just received a brand new systemax server two weeks ago.  Installed Server 2008 on a preinstalled raid1, updated, started installing drivers and exchange '10.
Well, the raid1 started experiencing some issues and since I hadn't done much to the box I decided to wipe it out and set it up again.  This solved my raid issues.
Currently, Windows Update will be "Checking for updates" for about twenty minutes and then give me this error: 8024402f
