there's even ways around the pad idea, but that's reaching the just silly point, and if your data is valuable enough to be worth past the just silly point you should trust your provider. The just silly point being figuring out a way to have the drive shared with a second host without the first hosts cooperation or popping the ram freezing it and breaking out the electron microscope. Doing more than the email idea might even be past the just silly point.
There are ways around it but linux has something called the atime parameter when you mount a disk it writes down every time someone accesses a file of course this doesn't stop them from mounting it with a boot disk set to noatime. Windows probably has something similar with the same fault, but that's your best bet unless you can find a hardware solution, maybe do that in combination with drive encryption? or have a second server sending requests for objects off the disk and consider it a security breach when there is downtime. Have that object be reading off the access times encrypted with a one time pad kept only in ram last hand off in the pad feeding a new pad the initial seeding of the first pad would have to be on site and could not be stored there. You could also just use another cryptographic approach like ssl or something, but one time pad is pretty hard to beat.
