Finally, I tested it on the domain controller of the client who will be using this software.  It worked just fine.  Just as the first client's had worked.
I do not accept the answer that the lastLogon property not being replicated is the answer.  That does not make sense.  It wouldn't work on any of these devices if that was the case.
I have tested a program I have just written on 4 different Windows Servers on 4 different domains.  The one I tested it on at first displayed to me all users, and all users' lastLogon attribute.  I can get this information off of any of their 12 domain controllers, and their on site exchange server.
The next client I tested this software on ran some issues.  I received 7 users that had the attribute lastLogon.  The rest Returned "Null" to my C# program.  I then proceeded to test with various Powershell scripts to verify that this was not an issue with my programming.  Powershell returned 12/31/1600 7:00:00 PM for these users.  When I open the Attribute Editor of Active Directory, these users show up with dates as early as today.  I tested this on both of this client's domain controllers (they only have 2, smaller client) with the same results.
ALSO, almost forgot, I have found that the lastLogonTimestamp attribute does not work on the 2nd client's configuration either.  Powershell tested to verify.
