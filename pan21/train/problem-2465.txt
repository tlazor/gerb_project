1st point is the most difficult of the two. Hopefully you have taken enough math and physics by now to wire your mind to think programmatically. If so then yes, you absolutely can learn a language! There are guides out there that teach out the syntax and functions. For example:  
Personally I would recommend Python first. To me the language places more emphasis on readability and cleanliness, making it a great first language. It's also a general purpose language so it's good to know. I did start with R though and it's also good, but is more function-over-form IMO. Try both out and see which feels best first, since you'll likely have to pick up both if you delve into this field anyways.
Based on this infographic and other things I've read, it sounds like you need to know some coding to be a true data scientist. http://blog.datacamp.com/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/ But you could still be a data analyst without compsci - basically a statistician. 
Johns Hopkins University as a set of course on Coursea that is gear on Data Science. Here is the link to the classes https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripTop. You can also take the classes for free.
Data Scientists code every day. However, just because you don't have background doesn't mean you can't pick it up! The level of programming you need to know to start doing Data Science isn't very high, but you will at least need:
