Timing requires a clock, usually a crystal oscillator. These are calibrated for the power source. If the power source degrades or drifts, the oscillator will have more jitter. With too much jitter, the system will not be able to synchronize its transmits and receives with the rest of the devices sharing the frequency, especially at higher data rates with shorter windows.
A device may not be able to communicate if it can't correctly share the frequency with other devices. The 802.11 spec requires precise timing in the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance algorithm. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF_Interframe_Space and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_coordination_function
So what's actually failing when a wifi AP degrades is likely the power supply, which then causes clock jitter, which prevents the device from sending recognizable signals. The power supply can be degrade from overheating (poor ventilation), worn out capacitors, etc.
Wifi systems can degrade when they can't communicate with other devices on the same frequency, even with a strong signal on the antenna.
