Firefox and Chrome both have private browsing modes which don't log you into sites. To access it in Firefox press Ctrl+Shift+P and for Chrome press Ctrl+Shift+N.
Also, another option is to create multiple different profiles for Firefox and then have different shortcuts that link to each different profile. This is what I do - I have one main profile and another clean profile (that I set it to not remember history/cookies/etc.). Also, make sure to set the shortcut to -no-remote to make it open a new instance.
Is it possible to launch new instance of chrome (or any other browser) with standalone session so that it would not log in automatically to applications? What I see now is when I launch new browser instance I log in into web-applications automatically - it has shared session between different instances of one browser. I want browser to allow to test application under several different users without logging in/out all the time.
Apart from using private browsing mode - as Adam543i indicated - you can also try the Multifox extension on Firefox. This extension allows Firefox to simultaneously connect to websites using different user names. Seems like overkill but CookieSwap affects all instances of Firefox.
