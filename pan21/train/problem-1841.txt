For lower end platforms such as consoles (which IMHO makes them unsuitable for hardcore gamers), Mono and by extension Unity supports FULL AOT compilation. This allows games made in a Managed language to run on platforms that do not allow JIT.
As Unity's rendering engine and core components are programmed in C++, you easily break the 60FPS mark as long as you don't do stupid stuff that would ruin the FPS in C++ games as well. Don't iterate through a huge list every frame. Avoid using division, multiplying by 0.5 is 10 times faster than dividing by 2. Don't read from files every frame, cache the data as you need it. Don't run any more code every frame then you need, stick much of your code in methods that are only called when they are needed.
While not technically .Net, many games made with Unity3D. EA has recently decided to use Unity3D for many of thier new games. The Unity3D engine uses Mono (an open source implementation of .Net) as it's scripting engine. Due to runtime optimizations, script performance as high as 120% native code speeds can be achieved.
