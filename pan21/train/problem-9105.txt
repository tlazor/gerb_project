The output of ls is piped to awk. awk starts processing the data. Standard delimiter is space. The sum variable tot is initialised to zero; the following statement is executed for each row/line outputted by ls. It merely increments tot with the size. $5 stands for fifth column (outputted by ls). At the end we divide by (1024*1024) to sum in megabytes.
If you would convert this into a script or function (.bashrc) you can also use it to get the size of certain subsets of directories, according to filetypes.
This isn't easy. The du command either shows files and folders (default) or just the sizes of all items which you specify on the command line (option -s).
Be aware, that you can't compare directories with du on different systems/machines without getting sure, both share the same blocksize of the filesystem. This might count if you rsync some files from a linux machine to a nas and you want to compare the synced directory on your own. You might get different results with du because of different blocksizes....
If you really just want the folders, you need to use find but this can be very, very slow since du will have to scan many folders several times:
This will bury you in a ton of small files. You can get rid of them with --threshold (1 MB in my example):
