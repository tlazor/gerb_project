Say if state X n Y each has 2 cities P,Q and M,N and ecah city is very different from other one then I will choose city as my geographical variable otherwise state as Geo variable is fine. So it depends on homogeneity of Geo unit.
For example if say you are predicting demand for luxury cars and city A has great roads, high income population etc. and thus high demand for luxury cars compared to city B which has none of features city A has. So in your model city A observations have more probability of buying a luxury car then city B observations.
So by using a bigger Geo unit than pincode you end up reducing categories say from 20000 pin codes you can have only 100 cities which is easily managable by xgb.
Pincode I feel very very likely is not a  predictor at all for the target variable you have. If you feel geography is an important predictor and has bearing on you target variable then what you can do is use city or state or other relevant geographical unit like sub-city etc. you feel have homogeneous characterstics.
