Pretty much any pair of graphics and physics libraries will work together. If you haven't managed to get OpenGL graphics and Bullet physics working, you probably just have a bug there which can be fixed.
3D Graphics(including a model loader of some sort(if it works with blender that would be even better. I would also like compatability, If Theres one that fits DirectX(at least 9) and OpenGL, then that would be good)
Also if there are any other libraries that work well with these I would like to know. Any answers would be very helpful. and details would be even nicer =)
What would be a good combination of libraries to make an online game with? Im sure that many people have good combinations of libraries for making a game.
2D Graphics(I liked SFML, so it its possible to get something that works with SFML, that would be nice)
Lately I have been working on a game that i plan to make online. I have used different libraries to make this game as far as i could, but I feel that I should rethink on how Im sertting this game up, so I planned to start over. The libraries that I have used are SFML, OpenGL, and Bullet Physics, along with GLM to load the models. 
and Physics(Ive worked with Bullet Physics, but I cant find a model setup that would fit with said physics)
I'm just going to go put Unity out there. It is, bluntly, amazing at everything you put. Except the networking (No idea, I'm afraid), and weaker on the 2D.
