Using DDE links in Excel requires that Excel run as an administrator, but as noted, checking that box on the Excel shortcut disables passing an Excel file to Excel.  I get around this by leaving the "Run as administrator" unchecked, and create a new shortcut for the file which uses DDE. 
On this shortcut, on the "Shortcut" tab, select "Advanced", then check the "Run as administrator" box. This will allow Excel to run with administrator privileges on this spreadsheet only.
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\EXCEL.EXE" "C:\Temp\DDE_test.xls", where the first string is the full path to Excel.exe, and the second is the full path to the spreadsheet (both in quotes).
I have Office 2010 on a Windows 7 64-bit system and cannot duplicate your issue. Maybe because I am an administrator? Maybe it's specific to Office 2007 ? 
The problem is that Excel files are by default opened with DDE (by sending a message to the Excel window). If you run Excel as Administrator, your Explorer process which is running as a normal user will not have the privilege to send messages to the former. This is a correctly implemented security feature.
It is generally a very bad practice to run programs like Excel as Administrator because MS Office files are common targets for viruses. If you want to access some protected file, just explicitly grant your current user "modify" access to that file/folder.
