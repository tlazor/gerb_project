My concern would be to ask why your card temperature is reading temps at just below the boiling point of water.  Do you get graphics artifacts at that temperature?  When it reads at that temperature, can you open the case and feel that much heat in the air near it coming off of the card? Either your overclock is dangerous for the card, or there's a busted component somewhere that is causing you to see these kind of numbers.  That could mean the card is on its way out, but it could also mean that you have a bad thermostat on the board that is reading silly temperatures.  The latter is not uncommon with computer components; you may not actually be hitting 96c.  
I would cold shutdown the machine for half an hour and immediately measure temps after booting; if it still says 96c while the PC is idle and has had time to cool down, it's probably just a bad sensor.
Heat can always damage other components, so it really matters how far the card is from other cards and parts.  If there's sufficient case cooling, it should be fine.
