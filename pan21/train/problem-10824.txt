Now...do a baseline of both Qcheck (throughput tests and response times) and numion's stopwatch loading timer on the website during a normal time.  Do it 2 or 3 times to get accurate measurements for a baseline.
We've found out that the ISP way upstream was doing some throttling/shaping. Thanks for the answers.
We had an issue with an ISP upstream "shaping" traffic and causing issues with our VPN traffic between sites.  
Then...when there is a "slowdown" reported run Qcheck and the timer site again and see what the differences are.
We used the ShaperPrope tool to identify the upstream ISP and things seem to have improved once we could identify the ISP involved.  They had denied any such manipulation.
For troubleshooting the root cause, you'll need to start breaking up the segments (server to firewall, server to switch, switch to firewall, firewall to ISP, etc.) and running similar tests or checking for packet loss, etc. on those segments to try and narrow down where the culprit lies.
Expanding on my comment on Dave M's answer, if you're dealing with traffic shaping here it may only be being applied at certain times of day, or when the pipe reaches a certain level of traffic for so long.
Another theory - your speedtest result might be being interfered with by an upstream transparent proxy. This theory assumes that the congestion would have to be beyond wherever this theoretical transparent proxy might be.
