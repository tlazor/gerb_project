I used @Anderson Zardo answer but I had to add several lines to preseeding so partman won't prompt user to "Finish partitioning and write changes to disk" and also included some possible caveats.
I believe the line you will need to add to your preseed file to answer "no" to that particular question is:
Following kickstart partitioning configuration works on both EFI and MBR configurations, it detects everything automatically and even creates /swapfile with recommended size an activates it for installed system.
So, I was messing with "part" kickstart options for so long without any success, and I realized that many redhat options are not supported. And if you make just 1 simple mistake in 1 option then Ubuntu installer switches to Guided partitioning. Moreover it fails to do Guided partitioning in this case: it can't install grub on MBR partitions at the end of installation and can't proceed to installation cause it can't detect EFI boot partition that it proposed in Guided partitioning screen.
For partitioning you can see an example in the linked example-preseed.txt, you will need to adapt it for your EFI partition.
Do not use kickstart with debian based distributions. Kickstart will be converted to preseed, so its better to use preseed (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseed) directly.
Then boot with preseed url and DEBCONF_DEBUG=5 into the installer. Every time the installer asks a question, you will see the config option logged on console 4. Then you can use this name to set the correct value.
As recommended start with an example preseed: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/installation-guide/example-preseed.txt
And I noticed that it installs grub during EFI install. I don't know why that's needed but it seems that grub is just not used and everything works fine. Hope I saved much time for anybody.
