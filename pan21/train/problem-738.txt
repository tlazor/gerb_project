The key question is what other backup stuff do you need in addition to raid. So raid systems don't protect you from viruses. So if a virus infects your system and you actually need to rebuild your computer, then the raid drives will not save you--they will all be infected. So you still need a backup solution, such as tape backup, a storage management unit like EMC, or some sort of online storage that backup up your hardware continuously. 
When I architected systems, there were a few different configurations that we used. Everyone above is correct that raid improves the fault-tolerance of your system. So if you have a hard drive failure, your data is preserved because it is mirrored across hard drives. This is important if your application is mission critical and the failure of the hard drive would shutdown the server. 
Second, if you need to run a system that has a lot of read-write throughput, like a database server or a machine for rendering 3D images/video, then raid will allow you to write to multiple drives at the same time. So that way a single drive head does not have to keep moving all across the disk--any of the drive heads can write the data to the disk, based upon the raid configuration.
When reading about RAIDs, you are almost always going to stumble about the fact that RAID is not a backup.
