In this situation, I use RapidMiner (RapidMiner). There a multiple solutions such as Hadoop and Radoop or RapidMiner cloud service etc.
I have a complex dataset with more than 16M rows coming from pharmaceutical industry. Regarding the data, it is saved in a sql server with multiple (more than 400) relational tables. Data got several levels of hierachies like province, city, postal code, person, and antigens measures, etc. I would like to create many dashboards in order to observe the changes & trends happening. I can use Pentaho, R (shiny) or Tableau for this purpose. But the problem is data is so huge, and it take so long to process it with dashboard softwares. I have a choice of making cube and connect it to dashboard. My question here is whether there are  any other solutions that I can use instead of making a cube? I don't want to go through the hassle of making & maintaining a cube. I would like to use a software where I specify relationships between tables, so the aggregation/amalgamation happens smoothly and output processed tables that can connect  to dashboards. I hear Alteryx is one software that can do it for you (I haven't tried it myself, and it is an expensive one!). I understand this task needs two or more softwares/tools. Please share your input & experience. Please mention what tools do you use, size of your data, and how fast/efficient is the entire system, and other necessary details.
