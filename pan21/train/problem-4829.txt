Please read Documentation/ABI/README and Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-system-cpu before using these files; in particular, they do not seem to be a stable ABI, and thus might become missing in the future. They come from arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c, which uses cpuid to directly get the information (meaning that, when present, they should be more reliable than dmidecode).
This corresponds to a L1 data cache of 64K, a L1 instruction cache of 64K, and a L2 instruction+data cache of 512K. Note that this is more detailed than /proc/cpuinfo, which only says cache size   : 512 KB. There are several other files in these cache/index# directories with even more detail.
On recent Linux kernels running on the x86 architecture, you can probably find the information you want at /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/cache (replace the # by the CPU number). For instance, on this computer (which does not have a L3 cache):
If all else fails, just use /proc/cpuinfo or any other method to find the model number of your processor, and look that up on google to find the specs.
