It is best to test this out on a page far simpler than Hangouts so you can get the measure of how it works.
Doing the same with Hangouts is tricky.  Each conversation is its own web page effectively. If you pop out the conversation, you'll see that it has a URL, but if you take the URL and put it into a new browser window, you get nothing.  The same would happen with a webslice.  It probably isn't doable, because there is javascript maintaining the state, that isn't migrated with the URL.
The contacts list is similarly difficult.  It is contained within an iframe.  The iframe is wrapped inside a div with the id "hangout-landing-chat", so it is possible that will work, but unlikely.
On the right of the SuperUser page when you are looking at a question, there is the sidebar with meta posts and Related questions.  Lets say you wanted a webslice of the sidebar.
I am using the Web Slice widget in the KDE Desktop Enviroment and I am wondering how I can find the CSS identifier (or what the CSS identifier is) for the hangouts box on Hangouts.google.com so that I can set the web slice to show me only that portion of the page. 
The web slice widget refers to an "id" within a webpage - this is literally an id="" tag that might be attached to a div element or any other.
This covers the entire sidebar, so using the URL of this question, and the id of "sidebar", you'll get a webslice of the sidebar only.
You can see how this works by hovering your mouse over the elements - you step through each one until you find an element that turns the entire section blue.
The short version of this is id in a webslice refers to an id of an web page element (such as a div) that contains all of the parts of the page you want to see - it is the parent of them.
If you right click the region, and choose "Inspect", you get a view of the HTML.  Going up from element you selected, you need to find an element that encompasses the whole area you want in the webslice.
