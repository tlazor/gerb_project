Sometimes you can help bridges (I use the term "bridges" in the expansive sense of anything that provides 802.1D bridge-like functionality, including switches and the integrated LAN/WLAN parts of home gateways and APs) update their bridge tables faster by sending multicasts or broadcasts from the MAC address of the device that moved. This usually occurs automatically due to ARP and DHCP broadcasts, but if you want to try forcing it by sending your own broadcasts/multicasts from the device seeing the issue, you could try pinging some broadcast and multicast addresses, such as 192.168.25.255 (assuming you're using a /24 subnet), 255.255.255.255, and 224.0.0.1, from the device that has lost touch with the other half of the network.
Aftermarket open-source router firmware distros might be less likely to have this bug, so updating your routers to OpenWrt/DD-WRT/Tomato/Gargoyle/etc. might clear this up for you.
It's probably router 2 that's at fault, but rebooting it also cycles the Ethernet link for router 1, so it's still possible that router 1 is at fault, but cycling the Ethernet link clears up the problem (unless you've already found that unplugging and re-plugging that cable doesn't get it out of the bad state).
It's quite possible that the firmware in one of your routers (it could be either one, really) is crappy and isn't updating its bridge table correctly when the MAC address of the client moves from being on that router's wireless interface to being seen on its Ethernet LAN interface (or vice-versa).
