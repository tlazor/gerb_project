Having a central DHCP pool which assigns addresses willy-nilly is insane for a server block. Assigning a server a specific IP via DHCP is less insane, in the sense that having 3 imaginary pink elephants chasing you is less insane than 5. 
...but no, still a bad idea for servers, production ones at least - maybe in a dev/test environment I guess, or for VPSs if you had no other choice.
DHCP essentially hands anyone plugging into the switch a valid lease. Yes, you can specify that only known MACs get leases, and everyone else is denied, but a better place for this is dynamic VLANs. 
Having each server machine rely on dhcp in order to have its networking stack come up correctly adds another potential fault. In a server environment, where you're trying as hard as possible to achieve maximum availability, adding another moving part is not a good idea
Very rarely is it wise to run DHCP in a data center without reservations, though some blend is appropriate.  In many settings, the "Cons" for DHCP with reservations end up being non-issues (if the router can take out DHCP, well, the servers aren't accessible anyway, etc).  It's also commonly a decision regarding size.  A datacenter with hundreds or thousands of servers with frequent deployments and reinstallation will certainly use some DHCP, even if it's only for testing/deployment.  A datacenter with a few servers will likely be fine with everything statically assigned.
Generally speaking, DHCP with reservations is the "best of breed" for IP management in the datacenter, depending (of course) on the particular needs of your data center.
There is no other good reason to have DHCP running in a datacenter as already pointed out so well by everyone else.
Not only to you have to specify in the DHCP server what each machine is assigned to, you have to keep documentation of it. And you have to update ALL of the documentation any time anything changes. New network card? Update documentation and DHCP server and DNS, etc.
