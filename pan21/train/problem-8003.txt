What do these errors mean? How can they be fixed? And if you say I have to reinstall Raspbian all over again, weeeeell. Yeah.
And yes, these errors popped up right after or during update/upgrade/installing time, and, as you can see, I was using the sudo's right.
Well the upgrade process still has locked the applications and the process might still be running in the background or glitched, try rebooting and then install a new version of raspbian, might save the update time.
Sometimes, using sudo apt-get upgrade takes sooooo long you just close off terminal to stop the "upgrade".
Oh well. Tried that, and now I'm getting problems when trying to install something else. For example, sudo apt-get update or sudo apt-get mesa-utils(A graphics library) didn't work. sudo apt-get upgrade didn't work at all, either, when I tried to try the upgrade again. I even went to the Raspberry Pi config (sudo raspi-config) and tried the update thing there (advanced options -> update), but they all outputted this or similar error messages.
