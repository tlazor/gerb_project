The first, if you want to get into building accounting software, but are really in the business of making money as a doctor, is to get involved in an open source project, like LedgerSMB.  The advantage is that if you really want to do this as a way to help support your business, you can learn as much as you want to (or as little as you want to also) and there are experts you can learn from in a hands-on way.  Also keep in mind that Ohloh puts LedgerSMB as approx 40k lines of SQL code (excluding blanks and comments), plus 49k lines of Perl, plus a similar number of lines in a bunch of other languages combined.  Accounting software is not trivial.  The second advantage here is that it gives you live participation with a community of people who are doing this and so you get a chance to make the software do exactly what you want.  You can then spend your copious free time integrating an EMR with it (or hire someone to do so) ;-).
TL; DR:  If you want to get into the field, join with people who are doing it.  If you just want software, you can buy it.
The second option you have is to buy a commercial software and just integrate what you are doing there business-process-wise.  The advantage here is you can buy some practice management software that will handle appointment tracking, billing, and the like or you can spend less and go with something like Quickbooks.  This gives you some choice but also a lot of tradeoffs and very little flexibility once tradeoffs are committed to.
