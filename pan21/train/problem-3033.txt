just setup site2site vpn, hardwarebased. site 1 winxp, site2 sbs2k3. site 1 192.168.1.0/24 site 2 192.168.0.0/24
from my research, i think the SBS2k3 server needs to have the subnet of site 1 added to it's subnets (AD Site & Services MMC, sites > Subnets), so I have added that subnet.
Question 2: Do I need to do something with Inter-Site Transports? My research make it seem like that is for replication between sites, and I don't think I need that?
Authentication from Site 1 to Site 2 share still not working. When prompted for credentials I am entering 192.168.0.4\username@smallbusiness.local and the password, which I have created inside SBS Server Management MMC, advanced Mgmt ? AD U & C > smallbusiness.local > Users, but it just keeps reprompting me to authenticate again. Local users at Site 2 using win x machine on local network can access share, auth works for them.
site 2 user can authenticate into site 1 xp computer network share using local user account on site 1 computer. winxp prompts for auth, un & pwd entered, share works!
Question 1: I also added site 2 subnet to it also. not sure if that is correct to have both in there. Both subnets site value = Default-First-Site-Name
Question 3: Do any ports in the firewall need to be open for authenticate to work? It works from Site 2 -> Site 1 without any open ports, so I think this is a SBS2k3 issue...
