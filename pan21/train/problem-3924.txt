Other than moving to 5GHz, maybe the best solution to this issue is to try to put together a band plan for your neighbors to abide by. You could hand something out recommending everyone to stick to using channel 1 or possibly 11 if they prefer reliability and maximum range, or use channels 5, 6, and 7 if they prefer to get high speeds but only at close range. Double wide 40MHz 11n networks should operate on channels 5, 6, or 7 with the secondary channel above, or be disabled entirely since it's often slower in a congested area like this. This is about the best you can do to satisfy both use cases.
All the Wi-Fi equipment that I have seen does not have the option to disable carrier sense, or otherwise disable the feature to avoid causing interference to other nodes by waiting to transmit while the channel is busy. This of course slows down your speed by being polite to others. So what happens is people set their network to use an in between channel that overlaps other networks' channels but isn't being used by any other network. Since their Wi-Fi nodes can no longer see frames sent by the other networks' nodes because the channels aren't exactly the same, their network works at full speed, but only at very short range. This effectively disables carrier sense. The result of this is that everything works only at very close range and becomes very unreliable if people move away from their access points. Now there is no channel to use that is free from networks partially overlapping the channel that you're on even if you just want a slow but reliable connection that works 100 feet away.
As far as your question about scanning the area with your desktop, yes you would have to get a plug in Wi-Fi adapter to be able to use inSSIDer. But even with that utility, it's unlikely that you'll be able to find a channel to switch to.
