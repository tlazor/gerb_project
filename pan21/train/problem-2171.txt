The fact that you dont mention your disc layout on a IO related question makes me suggest you dont know how databases work IO wise and someone just ordered a cheap dell server thinking that "it has a xeon, so it is fast" while databases often dont care about the CPU and are totally IO bound.
Makes me suggest you dont have a production server but someone who had no clue how to install a sql server orderd the hardware and set it up. As a result your database files live on the (slow?) system drive instead of having an IO optimized setup, and your disc simply is totally overlaoded. Happens when one runs high performance databases on a system disc instead of an optimized disc layout. Database servers are tricky to configure hardware wise.
Just as exmaple, I have a smaller database here (800gb) and I use 8 Velociraptors as a RAID 10 for the databae file and 2x120gb SSD for the logs - which nicely separates out the log IO from the database IO. And I am not happy with the database file disc IO and will soon upgrade with SSD caches.
SQL Server makes a IO request, it takes more than 10 seconds to complete. Normally it should take - for a high performance database server - 2-3 ms, not 15.000 or more.
