I use Linux, and mostly use the command line pwsafe and occasionally MyPasswordSafe - both available in the ubuntu repositories.
Dropbox works on Windows, Mac and Linux, and there are programs that use the passwordsafe format on all three platforms aswell. The original works on Windows, there is a java version that works on Windows, Mac and Linux. For a fuller list, see the related projects page that shows platform support for Windows, Windows Mobile, Mac, Linux, BSD, Solaris, perl modules, C# support ...
I save passwords in passwordsafe (or one of its variants) and keep the passwordsafe database in a folder shared by dropbox. (Dropbox syncs files online and across multiple computers).
When i am setting up services that are rarely going to need to be logged into i try to use the most obscure password (start of an md5 hash for instance) and then just store it in an encrypted/password protected spreadsheet.
It keeps you from worrying about that if someone somehow got the password for your domain name that he could essentially gain access to the whole system.
I use the open source PasswordSafe application for storing my personal passwords.  I keep the database file on a DropBox volume, so it is accessible from anywhere.  (hat tip: Joel)
There is no reason that the password database file can't be kept on a network share, and there is an option to open the password file in read-only mode.
