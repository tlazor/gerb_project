Microsoft has an official page comparing these approaches located here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/create-groups/compare-groups?view=o365-worldwide
Create an Office365 group containing the users you want, and then set it up to allow the members to send email on behalf of the group address.  Info on doing this can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/create-groups/create-groups?view=o365-worldwide and here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/create-groups/allow-members-to-send-as-or-send-on-behalf-of-group?view=o365-worldwide.  This works more like your forwarding approach, it doesn't need any licenses, and replies won't inherently be visible to all members.
Of note here is that both approaches (as well as both of your listed approaches) have an issue in that other users can't trivially see replies sent by a given user regarding mails received on the shared address.  This can be easily fixed by just having your users always use 'Reply All' instead of 'Reply' (I believe that you can actually enforce this on Outlook with group policy, but I'm not 100% certain).
