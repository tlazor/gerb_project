Anyway, on CentOS, Redhat or Fedora systems, with weird errors like that, turn off SELinux first and see if that helps.  Just be sure to turn it back on, it's there to help.
Even if you do get passwd into the chroot is it going to be useful?  The passwd within the chroot is going to update the /etc/passwd or shadow in the chroot, not the system passwd/shadow.  You will probably need to tell us more about what exactly you are serving out of this chroot since the details may help us provide you with a better answer.
I had a similar problem, but I believe I built my chroot differently.  Regardless, as the outer host of the chroot was a Fedora Linux system, I had to disable SELinux using setenforce 0 before I could successfully chroot /path/to/chroot /bin/bash and then use the passwd binary without getting an "Authentication token manipulation error."
Also, it appears to be kernel specific, as 4.17.14 worked without Disabling SELinux, but 4.17.9 required that I do so.
Note that it had nothing to do with shadowed passwords vs unshadowed (you should always use shadowed), and I Was trying to change the root password inside the chroot, so it had nothing to do with a blank password, etc.
