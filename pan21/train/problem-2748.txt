On Amazon (Not sure if this one is DTB305 but it looks the same), I found that it's a 5400 RPM Drive.
I've a 500 GB USB 3.0 External HDD which is half used (265 GB is used; total formatted capacity is ~460 GB). When I transfer files from that to my laptop's HDD (5400 RPM) via the USB Type-A 3.0 port, I get a max speed of around 100 MB/s. But the average speed while transferring large folders (~40 GB) is ~20 MB/s. It even reached 100-500 KB/s when transferring the last file I copied into it! [MB/s = Mega BYTE per second] 
I think that it has to do with where the data is actually stored in the Hard Drive, so will I have to create partitions in it to mark sectors with different speeds or the HDD is smart enough to store the data on the faster sectors first and on the slower sectors later?
On Toshiba's website, they mention max. transfer rate of ~5 Gbit/s (~625 MB/s). Can I ever get that even for 10E-100 picoseconds?
Also, can the CPU bottle-neck the transfer speeds if it's a dual-core or something? I've a quad-core Ryzen 2500u in a thermally cool chassis.
