I believe that what you are looking for is channel bonding but this will require configuration from your ISP side. If they are open to it, you can always approach them to help with it. This can be done if all your down-link connections come from the same ISP. 
You're going to need to place a device, most likely a router in front of your hotspot to load balance the connections, preferably a device that will do a round-robin load balance for you. A low-end sonicwall firewall can do this very easily, and provide you a little more protection at the same time.
Otherwise, the next best thing would be round-robin or some other neat routing trick. This can work even if your down-links are from different ISPs.
However, you must also realise that most of the bandwidth advertised by ISPs are best effort meaning that you may not get the linear increase in bandwidth that you may expect.
Yes. There are several devices on the market, currently in use in trains etc. You need to place a concentrator in some datacenter that will merge the datastreams. I have built such software too (Linux), it has been in use for several months. Contact me if you want to try/use it.
Mikrotik allows for bonding of multiple lines with their Router OS and Routerboard series hardware. We run this in a satellite office to improve upload speeds where "business" internet doesn't necessarily exist (at least, at a reasonable price).
