Based on your comments, you are looking for the data usage over different time periods. You will need to use something like NetFlow or some other method to generate your reports.
Bandwidth is how any raw bits you can push across a link in a given time period, usually measured in bps (bits per second). Throughput is how much usable data you can push across a link (basically, the bandwidth minus the protocol overhead), usually measured in Bps (bytes per second).
The show interfaces command uses the interface load-interval <seconds> command to configure its time period. It defaults to 300 seconds 5 minutes, and it can be set from 30 to 600 seconds.
That line is a few above what you provided. Interface counters (in the UI) reset (1) at reload, (2) when explicitly cleared (clear counters), or (3) when they roll over -- with 64bit counters, that's unlikely. (#2 doesn't touch SNMP counters)
To properly do traffic accounting for billing purposes, you need something like netflow to report how many bytes have actually moved across the interface, and what they were. That will give you a great deal of detail and accountability. Just looking at an interface counter in the UI (and even SNMP) is not going to be enough justification for billing purposes.
