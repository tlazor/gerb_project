The "enterprise" or "server" drives are more expensive, but have higher estimated MTBF as compared to "consumer" drives. They use higher quality parts. If you compare only "consumer" drives than some price differential really won't tell you much. You usually don't find "enterprise" drives in stores. You usually find them as OEM drives that you can order online or from certain suppliers. 
Not necessarily. Sometimes you are paying for the brand name, sometimes for the storage capacity, sometimes for access times (eg AV drives)
Check the reviews of the ones you are considering. If they're OK products you won't find many, if it's a poor product then you will find people complaining - that's human nature. So the lack of good reviews isn't a bad thing, but the lack of bad reviews is a good thing.
You would hope that a more expensive drive would be made from higher quality components - however, as with all things, that isn't necessarily the case.
No. Sata is just an interface to a hard disk and most reliability issues with hard disks is related to the actual hard disk and not the interface.
Personally I'd go for a brand I recognised, from a supplier I'd trust to replace it if it failed. Computer components tend to fail in one of two ways. Either when you first install them or at the end of a long(ish) life. If you've got a good returns policy to back you up then you've got the first situation covered.
