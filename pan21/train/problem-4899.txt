Find which files were written to in the last day: find / -xdev -mtime -2 (with some false positives for metadata updates). If you have an incremental backup (rsync-like) you could look at which files need to be re-sent.
Which files get accessed the most is not going to help you determine which parts of your SSD get the most wear, as files move around a lot... not only that, but most flash and SSD products implement wear leveling to move heavily-written blocks around so that one part of your drive won't wear out before another.
I'm using Ubuntu and recently bought SSD. I moved /tmp to ramdisk and did some other tweaks to avoid wear. But I was wondering if there's a way to pinpoint hotspots in filesystem where files are often written. For example webserver's log directory with many appends every minute or user's download directory where he downloads gigabytes of stuff only to be moved elsewhere soon after finishing.
I came across inotify which could probably do the trick but it seems it'd require lot of scripting which I'm not very familiar with :-/
