In my case, wpa_supplicant was being started by NetworkManager, which is a daemon used on most modern linux distros to control the network. While it works well in a desktop environment, it does not seem to support AP configuration, and constantly re-spawned wpa_supplicant even when I tried to manually stop it.
I had the same problem, running pidora 2014 (Fedora 20 remix for Raspberry Pi). The answer is basically the same as the other two given here: wpa_supplicant was running which prevented hostapd from using the device.
The solution was to disable the NetworkManager service and enable the "legacy" network service, which uses simple init scripts to control the network interfaces:
I basically trying to configure a linux laptop as a wifi router which other laptops and mobiles can connect to and then I can manipulate the traffic on for some network traffic testing (with lower bandwidths and caps etc.)
The error code is an indication that something else is using the device so the channel change is disallowed - perhaps wpa_supplicant is running in the background?
