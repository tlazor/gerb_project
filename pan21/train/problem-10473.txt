One reason is to ensure that there is some level of experience and knowledge in the ranked queues. It would be pretty annoying if brand new players were mixed into the ranked queue having little to no idea about how the game is played (both from a mechanics perspective and a meta perspective.
Games like League of Legends also have a nice ramping aspect to the path to the ranked queues. All characters start out in a more 'neutral' play style. The game is a little more forgiving because there are no runes to polarize and amplify hero characteristics. Once you get to rank 30 and have full rune pages, the DPS characters hit much harder and die much quicker while the Tank characters can soak up much more damage. By letting the players grow into these roles as the roles are emphasized by the runes / masteries, it builds a much better experience.
The OTHER side of this is likely as a way to combat cheaters/hackers. This is especially problematic in CS:GO. By making a large time burden on getting into ranked, it acts as both a deterrent and a throttle to keep people from using hacks. The problem of people getting banned and making new accounts now has a monetary penalty (Buying a new copy of the game) as well as a time penalty (playing for days before being allowed back into ranked queues). This is even more of a problem for free games like League of Legends or Fortnite.
