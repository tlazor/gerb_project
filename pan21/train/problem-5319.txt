I had this problem, but for a completely different issue. Make sure you compile your site before deploying it. I had some pages that were compiled and some pages that were not compiled.
It took me so long to figure out because when I tried viewing these pages on the application server (Windows Server 2008), it wouldn't let me view a non secure page (http protocol), because of Internet Explorer's security settings. I only had a binding for port 80 when testing on a browser on the server box. So I couldn't even see the aspx page that was compiled, let alone the aspx pages that were not compiled. A plain HTML page was visible on both boxes however, on the same site--that part was interesting. When I viewed the pages on another machine (running Windows 7) on that network, the compiled aspx page showed up fine because it was compiled. And the non-compiled pages did not.
I encountered this issue while doing some test migrations of our intranet applications from IIS6 to 7. I was able to solve the problem by modifying the following section of the Web.config file:
Change validateIntegratedModeConfiguration to true, and remove the WebServiceHandlerFactory-Integrated from the remove list.
