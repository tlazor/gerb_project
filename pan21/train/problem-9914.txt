Note that the issue I'm talking about is benign. It only happens when you have very little traffic going on, like once-per-second pings. A real web page load or video stream or download would be a lot more traffic and not show the latency graph sawtooth. 
I pinged a server a few hundred times and noticed a kind of sawtooth pattern in the ping times. It starts with 5ms, then gradually grows to ~300 and then drops to 5 again, over and over. I've seen this before, a few years ago in another apartment I was living in. I don't recall ever figuring out the cause though, at some point it just disappeared. 
Sawtooth shaped ping time graphs for Wi-Fi devices can be caused by 802.11 power save mode. You probably won't see the sawtooth if you set the ping interval to a tenth of a second instead of once per second. 
I moved to a new place and over here, I'm getting much worse internet speeds than I should. It was ok for the first day, around 40-60Mbps but the second and third day it dropped to 5-6ish, every now and then though, it returns to good speed for a few minutes.
