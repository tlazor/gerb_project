I tried this and all other suggestions found in the Google threads, to no avail...until I found that that there were other instances of Chrome still running when the only visible window was closed. Once all instances were killed, a new instance remembered its window settings as it should.
Exit Chrome, navigate to your User Data folder (eg C:\Users\IanN\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default), then open the file Preferences and look for the following section
Either adjust the number, or just delete the whole window_placement block—make sure to be careful not to delete other stuff; use the curly-braces as guides and make sure to match them. (Make a backup copy of the file, just in case.)
In my case it was one of the extensions that was causing the problem, I turned off all the Chrome extensions and then turned them on one at a time and then opened Chrome until I found the culprit (in my case it was the "Max Payback" extension which somehow uses what is called OpenResty). Now I turn this extension on only when I need it and then turn it back off.
Now run Chrome. It should be displayed in the default location. If not, then you could delete the other window_placement_* blocks from Preferences and …\User Data\Local State (Local State is a file in the parent folder of Default.)
You need to make sure that when you re-size the window that you do not allow the "snap" feature to do the re-size.  If the snap feature does the re-size then the window in question will not remember its last size when it is opened again.  Remember that the snap feature happens in Windows 7 when you push WIN + ANY DIRECTIONAL KEY or when you drag a window or edge of a window to one of the edges of your screen.
