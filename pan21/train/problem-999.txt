I currently have a wired 100 mbps network in my house. The wiring runs around in every room. I was thinking of upgrading to a gigabit network, since most of my comouters and router have gigabit ports.
Depends on the wire you used and the connectors and how clean your wiring is.  Gigabit most of the time uses all wire pairs - so if you wired correctly and wired all the pairs instead of just the 1-2, 3-6 pairs as some do then check the wire specs - Cat 5e or Cat 6.  Next is the connectors - did you wire crimp carefully?  Cat 5 100base can be a little messy, but the technical spec for Gig Cat 6 say that you can't untwist more than a quarter inch and that you must maintain the jacket and not seperate the pairs as much as possible.  The jacks should be Cat6 rated and the patch cables as well.
If you're running 100BASE-TX in your house then you have at least Cat5 cable, which is perfectly sufficient for 1000BASE-T.
If you have Cat 5e wiring, you won't need to upgrade your wiring. Most installations done in the past 5 years should be ok but you'll have to examine or test your cable to know for sure. 
So my question is, do i need to change the wiring to achieve gigabit connections or is it just a matter of having gigabit ports on the devices  ?
