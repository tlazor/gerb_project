So, only that you will have less overhead space. Are you using a swap partition ? You should put this at the end of the drive, it will be one less to move during a resize. Sometimes it is just easier to pick a number. If you just make it EXT2, you can store backup images of the partitions in files inside ?  
No, there are no real drawbacks to not fully utilising the disk.  You are not changing the geometry. Partitions may fill earlier, but you should not be concerned about wear levelling as the controller should handle that in the background. 
"Unformatted" is not the same as over-provisioning, which can improve performance and longevity of the drive in exchange for smaller usable drive size.  Samsung Magician and similar firmware controls give you some control over the SSD over-provisioning.
I am duel booting Windows and Ubuntu on a solid state hard drive. I have most of my files stored on a secondary hard drive. I was thinking of leaving a large portion of the SSD partitioned and giving both operating systems smaller partitions, so that I can increase their size later as they need to grow (but I don't want to set the size now because I don't know which is going to need more space and it's a real pain to shrink windows partitions. Are their any drawbacks of this system I should be aware of?
