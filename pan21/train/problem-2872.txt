The other thing to look for is long term stability, assuming you don't need the latest and greatest features, which you usually don't with a server. This means distros like Ubuntu LTS, Debian, CentOS, etc.
While I don't have a specific recommendation, here is a great resource for evaluating various Linux distributions:
There is a handy list on the right side titled, "Page Hit Ranking" that ranks most of the distributions listed here by how often they are viewed. On the page for each distribution is a list of resources that should help if anyone is researching this topic.
If you're willing to broaden your horizons to something other than Linux I would suggest FreeBSD -- IMHO the base OS you get is cleaner and you can get away with less "extra" stuff installed on the system, which hopefully leads to fewer security holes down the line.
CentOS is more suitable to be used as a Server. It's the "free" version of RedHat Entreprise Linux. There is a lot of repos and you've got some help for it.
I'm use to work with RHEL, CentOS and Ubuntu Server, and my choice would definitly go to CentOS or RHEL (if you can afford the licence price!).
