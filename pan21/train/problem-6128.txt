My biggest problem is that I need a keyboard like this because I type to fast, and the normal Dell type keyboard causes me to log myself out of our work network every few hours. Painful actually.
I think if you use both types of keyboard on a regular basis, then no, probably not. However, from personal experience I can say that if you use natural keyboards 100% of the time, then after a while (say a year or two) then you'll certainly feel it when you go back to an old fashioned wrist breaker.
This is no problem at all for me, did use natural both at home and at work for a while and regular where no problem then. Now days I got a gaming keyboard at home (non-natural that is), and still natural at work and it's no problem. 
For me natural did feel odd at first (but mostly because using keyboard wrong with hands over the place) after a while I did get used to it, but that didn't make normal keyboard feel wrong. Natural keyboard mostly force you to use any keyboard the right way (unless one all ready is a pro)
I don't necessarily have a problem switching between different keyboard, however I must admit I end up buying the same one for each computer I use at home and at work, since I find it easier to work this way. It is an extreme however.
I bounce between a few different keyboards pretty easily as my laptop has a slightly smaller keyboard, my work desktop has a regular keyboard but my home desktop has a wireless natural keyboard that I really like but not enough to move it among all my computers, though I may change that.
BTW, I have the Natural Keyboard 4000 and I can safely say it's the best ergonomic keyboard I've used - and I've tried lots of them.
