I was looking for an answer to your question also, and by now all that I have read said that you will need more privileges on your server (which you won't get on shared hosting).
I wrote about projects to get R online on my blog here (like ggplot2 web interface and R-node),  If you find good solutions, please let me (us) know.
I wrote a trending class in pure PHP as part of PHPExcel, to provides the functions for calculating coefficients and plot. It should provide everything that R can provide. As an alternative to running R itself, you can find it on the PHPExcel site at codeplex. If you can't find an exec() solution, you're welcome to pillage that code to provide a pure PHP solution, though I'd appreciate any feedback/bugfixes/etc
I designed a web page that lets user define some criteria using drop-boxes etc. and php collects the relevant data from the database according to that criteria.
What I intend to do is modeling a least squares trend line over that data using R and displaying coefficients and plot etc.
Potentially going do a virtual dedicated server would work for you, but I don't know yet of someone saying that he did it and that it works.
But I'm unable to run R, though it's installed in the server and works as expected when invoked within the server. I guess there are some security issues.
On the other hand, some time ago I was making something similar and I used a named pipe through which PHP was sending commands to a constantly running R instance, which was then putting its output directly to the database. In this solution the pipe served as a queue, so it could survive multiple clients at one time. 
Can anyone lead me to a solution. My hosting company says it's impossible to run a exec() command to invoke R within PHP because of security reasons.
