Traditional way to ship PHP applications is to provide a source code package with an optional setup script for initial configuration stage. In this case you assume that your user already has a working hosting environment and you only provide setup utility and documentation for the application itself. You can have a script to validate hosting environment before proceeding with further steps.
Have a look at http://www.docker.com. I never used it myself so I can't give you exact details, but it may be a suitable solution.
Your users are very likely to have different hosting environments as well as different requirements for running your application. So I don't think that there is a one size fits all solution to your problem.
A different approach would be to provide whole hosting environment together with your application. Two possible ways to achieve that could be to provide a virtual machine image or a Docker container. The basic idea here is to provide all the dependencies together with your application.
