As you can see, rtvscan process which is Symantec Endpoint Protection is performing almost 1MB/s writes and is scheduled to run once every week with full system scan which I wonder whether should replace with another less-resource intensive antivirus. I am not yet knowledgeable about Host Writes, NAND Writes and difference between both, but considering I have been using SSD only for 2 weeks with mostly browsing, over 180GBs is a lot of writes.
As long as computer is operating, OS constantly performs small writes to storage medium. This is what I have not paid attention to earlier until I saw total writes in CrystalDiskInfo, Intel Toolbox and writing activity in Windows 7 Resource Monitor:
If my assumptions are correct, I reckon just by having computer idle with OS running (which often is case with mine) will continue wearing out SSD, hence not forgetting to put machine on Standby or even Hibernation if you know you won't use computer for long will reduce unnecessary writes and prolong SSD's life.
