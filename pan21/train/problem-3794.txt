On Linux the main server configuration file is usually at /etc/apache2/httpd.conf or /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, and it typically uses an Include directive to incorporate other files which may be in subdirectories of /etc/apache2. If you're using a non-Linux system, I'm not sure where the config file would be, but it should be documented on the Apache website.
/usr/local/apache2/htdocs, /var/www/html or others. You can see what the locations are for various distributions here. You can also place it in other directories to control portions of your site differently.
If you don't have access to the main server configuration, the .htaccess file should be created in the directory you want its directives to apply to.
Don't. Edit the main Apache configuration file instead. (I'm assuming you have access to it because it's your server) The .htaccess file is a file that people can create to apply certain configuration directives when they don't have access to the main server configuration, but Apache can handle requests more quickly and easily when it doesn't have to bother with .htaccess files.
.htaccess files can go in any directory under the document root, so there can be more than one.  There can also be none.  And, depending on your system configuration or FTP client, you may just not be able to see it, because it starts with a period.
Not pretty, but it works if you have no idea where things are on your server. Be prepared to wait while it churns.
