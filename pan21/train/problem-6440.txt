You can check the setup.ini to see what path it's looking for when doing the installation.  It sounds like to me that it's looking for another path to do the install.
the above command should tell you if there are any options to traverse an install error state like this.
Using depends.exe, I see there is a complaint that DWMAPI.dll cannot be found, but according to what I can find, that should only be referenced for Vista.
I had exactly this problem, you do need the setup directory that you are missing. I believe that this directory was created by a self extracting executable. Look for another executable not named setup.exe. Unfortunately I don't have the files available to check for what the name was, it might be something silly like install.exe.
Sometimes you can run these setup programs from the command line and use command line switches to bypass the simple errors and continue the install regardless of integrity checks.
I just had to replace my hard drive, and am reloading all applications. It's got XP with all current patches, and VS2005 already installed, including the MSDN that came with it.
C:\usr\Microsoft\VS2008\msdn is the directory containing the setup.exe file; oddly despite the message there is no Setup directory under it. The entire VS2008 installer package was copied to C:\usr\Microsoft\VS2008 and everything else installed fine.
