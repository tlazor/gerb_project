If you're planning on running Zimbra Network Edition they currently do not support CentOS.  Although it's by far the most voted for request from the users.  If you're using the community edition then this may not be as important.  That said I've been running Zimbra Network Edition on CentOS for over two years and haven't run into any issues.  I also haven't been in a position where I've needed to open a support ticket with Zimbra.
Back to the original question about security.  Zimbra installs it's whole stack so all the public facing services are going to be part of that stack which is maintained by Zimbra and not your distribution.  So the only time the distro really comes into play is with remote exploitable Kernel issues.  Which both distributions deal with pretty quickly.
There are some key differences, namely Ubuntu + AppArmor vs. CentOS + SELinux.  I've not used SELinux, so I can't comment on it, but I've heard that it's trickier to implement properly than AppArmor.  Perhaps someone else with more experience can chime in here.
I'm going to say it depends on configuration more so than distribution, and if you're more comfortable with CentOS than Ubuntu, stick with what you know and spend more time on securing your environment than adjusting to the nuances of a different distro.
