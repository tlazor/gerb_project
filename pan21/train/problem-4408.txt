That's why, I wanted to hear from people who have successfully migrated from their initial research field (in UG/MS level) and have been able to embark on a completely different field for their PhD - how did you explain the reason for your shift in the SOP, whether that affected their chances in getting into a top school etc. Also, for any academics browsing the question, what would be your take on it - do you always prefer students who have a background matching your interests only ?
However, since I've had no research experience in TCS(Theoretical Computer Science), I'm afraid that would hurt my chances of getting admission to a reasonably good school in the US - whereas, the research experience in VLSI (as well as the LORs from my adviser/committee members, who are well known in the field of VLSI) would have helped me get into a good program (but my enthusiasm in that field has already petered out).
I had completed M.Tech in CS 2 years back, completing my dissertation in the field of VLSI Testing. While I liked my work, I don't wish to go back to pursue my PhD in that - I've been strongly wanting to pursue a theoretical course (in approximation/online algorithms) as means for obtaining my doctoral degree.
