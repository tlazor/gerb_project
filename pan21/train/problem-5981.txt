Intel does have a virtualization technology called VT that provides an instruction set tailored specifically towards virtual machines. The Intel ARK has a list of VT capable processors. You'll find quite a few mobile processors there as well as desktop.
You need literally tons of memory and a fast disk.  Go for a 7200 RPM or even 10000 RPM if traditional harddisk, or a SSD (but these are small).  The RAM you do not need, will cache the disk so the more the better.
A powerful Intel Core i5 processor with 8 GB of RAM is recommended if you looking for best laptops for virtualization. Some of these are listed here:-
I was concerned about disk speed. I have an SSD boot drive, but even at 240G, a few VMs would fill it up quickly. So I got a big 7200 RPM drive that I put in the Ultrabay, and I run VMs from there. I'm sure performance would be better if they were on an SSD, but given all the compromises, I'm happy with this setup.
I'm very happy with the performance of VMWare Workstation on my new laptop: a Thinkpad T520 with 8 gigs of RAM and the i7-2720QM, which is a 2.2 GHz hyperthreading quad core.
