First, select all level 1 indents (you can use CTRL and double click the word to select it), then right click and select the Paragraph menu option to bring up the paragraph options. In here make sure the Indents and Spacing tab is selected and change the Outline level option from Body Text to Level 1.
Word only supports sorting on single-level lists, so any indents will be treated as a part of that sort operation (which is why the list gets messed up like this).
The one caveat to this is the time (having to select each top-level indent), as well, you'll need to make sure that each time you add a top-level bullet, you must set it's Outline level to 1 (or set a default style to do this automatically).
A work-around for this is to utilize Outline mode and set the specific paragraph outline levels of the top level lists and then sort.
Now you can sort: click the Home tab in the ribbon menu, click the Sort button and the top level indents will be sorted accordingly. After the values are sorted, you can leave Outline mode.
Next, click the View tab in the ribbon menu and select Outline, this will give you a sort of "table of contents" type of view for your document; on this tab there's a drop down list labeled Show Level: which should say All Levels, change this to Level 1 and now only the top level indents will be displayed (i.e. "Question X") with the sub-level indents collapsed.
