I think the mistake may have been that you moved the free space from partition D into a new partition after partition D instead of before it. You'll need to have GParted decrease the free space in partition E and move the free space into partition D. Then decrease the free space in partition D by increasing the space before the D partition. And finally, you should be able to increase the space in the C partition. 
Right click on My Computer and select Manage. Then go down to Disk Management. Right click on your E drive and select "Change drive letters and paths." From there you can create a sub-directory on the C: drive where the /dev/sda3 will be mounted.
I have had similar problems when I've had a mix of extended and primary partitions. If this the situation you have then one of the lines will be labled extended for the file system and two of your partitions will be under it.  If this is what you have you need to resize the 2 sub partitions and move them to the start of the extended partition, then resize the extended partition and move it to the end of the disk and then expand your c drive.
Then you can shuffle everything onto your c drive and delete everything else and expand the c drive to fill the whole disk
Changing you partitions may not be required (depending on need). Using the XP Disk management tool, you can mount NTFS partitions as sub-directories similar to the way LINUX works.
I'm a big fan of KDE Partition Manager on a LiveCD. It runs GParted behind the scenes, of course, but i've found works when a GParted LiveCD doesn't by itself.
