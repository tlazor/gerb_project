Looked around and Googled but could not find a similar question. It seems most people want to take a bootable USB thumb stick and convert it into a PXE boot image. I actually need to go in the opposite direction, that is, create a bootable USB thumb stick from PXE boot files.
I have a PXE server used for disk imaging. Some devices on my network are not able to PXE boot because 1) PXE is already being used by something else on their subnet or 2) their network adapter doesn't support PXE. My only option would be to grab whatever files are being used to PXE boot the device and try to make a bootable USB thumb drive.
I have access to the PXE server which is using PXELinux. Here's what's in the "default" file being used by PXELinux. 
I'm mostly a Windows/Mac guy but can get around in Linux and am comfortable running command lines in a terminal. I know next to nothing about the Linux boot process nor how to make a bootable USB thumb drive. I gather from the above PXELinux config file that the bzImage and init.gz files are needed to PXE boot a client device. Is there a way to use these 2 files and the info from the PXELinux configuration to create a bootable USB thumb stick?
