While this may seem to come down to a mere visual annoyance at first, it actually affects how you save attachments.  If they're in the header of the email, you can right-click the header and Save All Attachments.  If they're imbedded in the body, though, you have to save each attachment individually.  This is very tedious when you regularly receive emails with up to 10 attachments.
This will create an HTML file and folder (with the same name of the HTML file) with all files needed to view the message independently. In the folder created will be all the attachments.
Outlook 2010 seems to be inconsistent with how it attaches files to emails.  For example, create a new email and drag multiple files into it.  They will show up in a field labeled Attached beneath the Subject field.  However, when attaching files to a reply to another email, Outlook behaves in one or two ways:

Microsoft knows what's best for you, so they removed this functionality because you can not be trusted to receive safe email. This helps prevent inadvertent downloading of malicious code embedded into items.
