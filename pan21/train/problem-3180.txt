This is only my enviroment and probably does not apply to many other people, but we run in a Terminal Services enviroment. My main reason for not deploying Firefox is because of memory usage. Even in Firefox 3 we still see massive (2GB plus) Firefox browsers running. Where as IE runs in much less RAM (500-800 MB) for the same people.
Also mentioned was user education. People get used to a specific software application, be it IE, MS Word or Windows itself, and they dont want to change. Or training them to use something else is too costly. It doesn't matter if we technical people can switch between applications on a whim. It doesn't even matter if the new application is pixel-for-pixel the same program, some users see a different icon and their entire world explodes.
Firefox can be widely deployed and managed in the enterprise, given enough resources - IBM deployed and managed baseline configuration defaults through their internal workstation management tool. I know people at "enterprisey" organizations that do this with Firefox as well because the benefits over IE outweigh the negatives.
However, the biggest barrier I've heard/seen with Firefox is that many internal web applications are simply IE only. ActiveX aside, the cost of updating the web app's content (or getting the vendor to) is too high. I'm talking about HTML/CSS/JavaScript presentation stuff that can be browser dependent, and of course the ActiveX, MS-specific development tools, whatever else makes sites 'IE only'.
