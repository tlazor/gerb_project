If you can't transfer an installation file to the remote computer, you can maybe transfer a script that will download a file to a folder.
Right click the file and select "Compile file", you'll get a DownloadBrowser.exe (it should e a few hundred KB). Execute the exe there. The browser installation should run automatically.
Note: The workstation is troubleshooted over a remote connection, thus a copy of a browser on a flash is sort of difficult under the circumstances.
Windows 7 includes a version of the Powershell Console.  Here are the commands you need to download Chrome from Powershell:
I have a very strange problem with IE, it somehow disappeared of the user's workstation. I detected a lot of infections, some malware and some worms. I definitely suspect the iexplore.exe being deleted or infected and /or removed by the anti-virus agent, since the error I am getting says The specific path does not exist. Check the path and try again. So what do I do now? I tried booting in safe mode as well, traced the internet explorer location, but no iexplore.exe found there. I also tried to get I.E reinstalled by installing windows updates, no sucess. So is there anyway to download another browser without access to a current browser? In worst case I can recommend an re-installation of Windows, but would like try to and fix the problem first. In Linux a way to do this would be something like sudo apt-get install chrome-browser,but fortunately Linux and virusses aren't friends.
