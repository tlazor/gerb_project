The delay experience is due to discrepancies between the IO buffers and communication with your OS. When you press a key and simultaneously move the mouse that information has to be moved to keyboard's and mouse's buffer. Their controllers will then generate an interrupt and forward it to the operating system to pass the events, however it is overwhelmed by having the simultaneous interrupts from the mouse and the keyboard, thus experiencing the delays. This is an inevitable consequence of non concurrent process..Also try this in any OS and you will experience similar results.

This sounds like more of a hardware issue than a settings issue.  Given the large amount of hits with "Flex 2 touchpad issues" you're likely going to experience this issue until you switch to using an external keyboard and mouse or replace the laptop.  That said there are several things to try.
