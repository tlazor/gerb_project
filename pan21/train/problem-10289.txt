Like a number of people recommended build your own box, unless you have the budget to buy from a storage vendor. The problem is that most consumer grade solutions tend to have fatal flaws that will impact the end result.
Dell has a NS500 for arround $3k use MS storage server.. you can add an iscsi target to it.  I used one in the past for a VMWare cluster that had 150+ Vm on it.  Never had a problem.
I'd look into Thecus products.  We have a Thecus N5200 as our onsite backup storage target, which locally stores backups for retrieval purposes, and is blazing fast.
The only downside to Thecus products is the interface is a little lacking in design.  As far as I can tell, it was built by great people with English as their second language and more experience designing robust backend systems than easy-to-use frontends.  They are very "set it and forget it" though, if you won't be messing with anything on a regular basis.
We're currently looking into purchasing more for use as a camera storage backup system.  Either the N5200 (5 disk cube style) or an N8800 (8 disk rack mount).  From what I read on the 8800, it is blazing fast as well.
If you don't mind building the box yourself, FreeNAS is an alternative.  Power of BSD with an Open Source price.  FreeNAS 0.7RC1 includes ZFS support.
