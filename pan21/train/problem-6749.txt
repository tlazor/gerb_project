The short of it is that active directory queries are sent to active directory servers, while local authentication is handled using the SAM in the registry. If you want to switch methods, you'd authenticate as \localmachinename\username instead of \activedirectory\username right at the opening login prompt when you turn on the machine (some versions of windows let you change the "method" in a third box, under username and password, where it lists domains available or the local computer name (this computer).
The difference? One is local to that computer only, one is providing a way for you to have an account valid on any machine that is a member of the domain. AD centralizes the management of the accounts and centralizes passwords and user management. If you have more than a couple Windows computers, AD can be very helpful and almost necessary for running the IT infrastructure.
I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for on how AD vs. local machine authentication works, but you can switch between the two. The topic is enough to take up volumes.
This sounds a little bit like a homework question...is it? Is there a particular issue that these questions are aimed at solving that the community could possibly help with that you're driving at?
