Right now the best solution I came up with is using a very short function name, e.g. $('log hello') or the slightly shorter template literal syntax $`log hello`. Both solutions require at least three additional characters, even more keystrokes, and the input must be surrounded by quotes/ticks/braces.
I would definitely accept solutions involving browser extensions, as long as they integrate with the existing console or at least do not require a completely new implementation of the developer tools console tab.
This would make it possible to integrate a custom DSL directly into the browser console and make it feel more like a native terminal. For example, the custom processor could translate an input of log hello to the valid JavaScript expression console.log("hello") and eval it.
I am currently in the process of moving my web-dev work from classic IDEs to the web browser console. The console is basically a JavaScript REPL, which is great, but that also means it can only process valid JavaScript expressions. Is there any way of redirecting the input to a custom processing function instead?
