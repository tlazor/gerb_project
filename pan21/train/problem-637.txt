The answer to your second question is no.  You are billed for an instance hour, the whole time that the instance is up, running and able to take requests, rather than say, a CPU-hour which might be just the "work" done on the instance.  You will be billed the price for the rounded up number of hours that the instance has been on for.  If you turn it on for 5 minutes and shut it down, you will be charged $0.10.
However, I'd argue that it could be very economical for software testing if it's shut down while you're not using it.  Testing is one of the most common use cases for EC2, where you're able to start up an instance, test software for a few hours and then shut it down, working out much cheaper than leaving it running while you're doing other things/sleeping.
Regarding the total monthly bill, the short answer is yes - an instance at $0.10/hour will be about $72 for a month.  However, you can purchase reserved instances which can work out up to about 50% of the price if the server is being run continually.  In the example of the m1.small type of server ($0.10/hour normally), the yearly cost would be $490 with a reserved instance (one year reservation) or $876 on "pay as you go".
