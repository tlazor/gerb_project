2- I would say it would be a good idea and easier to mantain if each domain has it's own txt record and you include it as in the mentioned example.
The domain example.com has published an SPF policy, however, an error occurred while the receiving mail server tried to evaluate the policy:
       spf=neutral (google.com: 111.22.33.44 is neither permitted nor denied by domain of user@example.com) smtp.mailfrom=user@example.com
       spf=neutral (google.com: 111.22.33.44 is neither permitted nor denied by domain of user@example.com) smtp.mailfrom=user@example.com
3- It is always a good practice to have an abuse@ account for handling rejections, bounces, etc. So yes, I would rather say having mx helps in email reputation (I would say is de facto / mandatory, as any serious provider would ensure it exists and eventually you may handle it indirectly) don't know by now but by the time I was working with email, that was an important part of "reputation building techniques"
but mentioned in relation to this post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6110534/how-to-create-spf-record-for-multiple-ips) not duplicated though (as the answer doesn't seem to work anymore there)

The first one is from my hosting provider. I DO send and receive email through my hosting provider. Emails from here do not go to spam.
Second SPF is for my digital ocean droplet. I ONLY want to send email from the sever NOT receive. All messages from this server go to spam.
Googleing around I have seen many articles that suggest not using multipule spfs record and use 1 and combine them.
An SPF-enabled mail server received a message from example.com (111.22.33.44) that claimed an envelope sender address of user@example.com.
An SPF-enabled mail server rejected a message that claimed an envelope sender address of user@example.com.
If you are really interested into sending emails and reputation, I would keep sending different domains in different addresses (whenever possible) to not harm some email reputation with the other domain.
Received-SPF: neutral (google.com: 111.22.33.44 is neither permitted nor denied by domain of user@example.com) client-ip=111.22.33.44;
For that, i.e. you can check sendgrid or any other email sending "specialist" (they live on that, so maybe could be a good option (check as well email services that offers several domains, such as hotmail.com / live.com ...

1- For combining more than one spf, a good answer could be looking for some spf that has achieved that already (you can try a good example by digging some, the command would be dig txt domain.name)
