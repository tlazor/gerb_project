When the installation of Windows 8.1 got to the second step (Copying the files needed, I think) the machine turned off completely.
The machine turned on first time, and happily sat in the BIOS for 20 odd minutes whilst preparing a USB Drive elsewhere to install Windows.
Other troubleshooting steps have been attempted and not resolved the problem (It's not the PSU), we haven't had a chance to remove the components and inspect them yet. 
Realistically, if a Pin was bent during install would it have turned on and ran for 30 minutes or so before cutting out, or would it just have not started even once?
Rather than a discussion on further troubleshooting: Realistically, if a Pin was bent during install would it have been able to turn on and run for 30 minutes or so before cutting out is the question...
It attempted to restart but the fans just span for a second, and then the power went out again, the fan started, and stoppped, and continues this way.The same thing happens continuously now when the machine is powered on.
