I've used Torque products for years now I would defiantly recommend them. The company did go into administration but has come back to life recently with quite a few updates to the product lines. Definitely worth downloading the trial version and taking a look.
The tooling includes: FontEditor, Tiled Map Editor, Sprite/Animation Manager. Additionaly there is support for Phys2D a Java Based Physics Engine. 
There's a ton of links if you ask Google about it, but most of them are things that seem relatively unheard of. I have used one of the top results, Love, for a little while and found it pretty quick to get up and running with. It uses Lua.
I think the biggest strength in Crafty is the component/entity architecture. It's a great way to structure your games and Crafty makes it very easy to create your own components.
Slick2D http://slick.cokeandcode.com/ is great for Java with some great Toolings available. Have a look at the Feature List.
You also have the option of using Unity or Ogre or Irrlicht or any of the other available 3D game/graphics engines to simulate a 2D space, but that may involve more extra work than you want.
There's also Torque 2D, which I've heard decent things about (it is non-free, which I know you mentioned, but it is also relatively cheap, so...). cocos2d is quite popular for the iPhone.
If you want to dabble in HTML5 games I suggest you look in to Crafty.js.  It is a small but flexible game library that's easy to learn and handles the essentials like input, collisions, sprites, etc.
