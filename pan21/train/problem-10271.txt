The answer is quite simple though. I'll give 2 posisble options. A recommended solution and an alternative solution.
Do not install a DHCP server on the AD server and keep using the router, ignoring the warning that AD gives you during install. Make sure you give the server a static IP outside of the DHCP scope of the router. Also make sure you point the DNS server to the server IP on your router, or your clients will have trouble finding the server.
A DHCP server broadcasts through the network that it is a DCHP server, so whenever any device connects to the router, and DHCP is disabled on the router, the device will automatically find the DHCP server on the server itself and gets the IP it needs from there. An AD server can function in both ways, but when the DHCP server is not available for some reason, things can go bad. When the server runs the DCHP server, it will know when thigns stops working and keeps that in mind. In addition, misconfigurations are less likely to happen, because the server knows what to keep in mind.
