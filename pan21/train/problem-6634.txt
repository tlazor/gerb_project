I am performing an experiment on 2 Xeon based servers. Both the servers have two dual port NIC, total 4 NICs. OVS is running on one server and DPDK pktgen on the other server.
I want to measure the performance for large number of tables entries and that is why I need to generate packets with fake mac address.
I tried to find out the solution but all the tutorials have mentioned the same thing to add flows to the tables for l2 forwarding. Why is the OVS not forwarding packets in case of fake mac addresses? I have used all the ports in promiscuous mode. 
I verified that the pktgen is generating the packets with these mac addresses, but the OVS doesn't forward the packets in this case. Am I missing something here?
I tried to add flow rules to the table to run OVS as L2 forwarding switch. I ran the following commands to create the bridge and add the flow rules.
Everything is working fine in this case. And then I changed the pktgen to generate packets with the fake mac addresses. I also changed the flow rules in the table by executing the following commands.
