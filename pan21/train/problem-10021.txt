If they're set wrong, the tool will display where the settings are coming from (either a specific group policy object, or the Local Security policy); it can then be corrected there.
I'm gonna base this answer on the assumption that it's the To log on to this remote computer, you must be granted the allow log on through terminal services right error, since that seems likely.. but let me know if that's inaccurate.
The defautl administrator account you're talking about, is that the domain administrator account? If so, double check that domain admins is a part of the local administrator group on the domain PC.
What's probably happening is that the User Rights Assignment for RDP is set to something strange.  Hop on a DC, and check out the Resultant Set of Policy for the server in the Group Policy Management Console tool.  Under User Rights Assignment, there are two settings to be concerned with: Allow and Deny log on through Remote Desktop/Terminal Services.  Deny should be empty, and Allow should contain Administrators and Remote Desktop Users.
Double check that RDP is enabled on the workstation. Right click My Computer > Properties > Remote Access. There should be a check box for remote access. This is for XP.
Hey everybody, I just started messing with AD about three days ago, but I have one machine running as the AD DC computer, and another that joined the domain with no problems. The only wierd thing is that I can RDP into the Domain Controller no problem, but I cant rdp into the other Domain Computer using my default administrator acct, an acct I made and gave domain admin privs to, but I CAN login using the built in windows administrator acct. Any words of wisdom? I figure its not a firewall problem because I can use the local acct to rdp into it, its not a domain issue because I have a share folder between the DC and that particular Domain Computer so Im not sure.
