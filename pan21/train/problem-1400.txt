This is absolutely true. SSD on database servers combined with high (actual) RAM makes IO waiting significantly shorter. However, RDBMS indexing and caching is still of value because even systems with this huge IO boon can and will have IO bottlenecks from poorly performing queries caused by bad indexing. This is typically only found under high workload applications or poorly written applications.
Based on your post, it appears the clear message is that RDBMS lookup time optimizations are being replaced with hardware which makes IO time negligible. 
The key value to RDBMS systems in general is data consistency, data availability, and data aggregation. Utilizing an excel spreadsheet, csv file, or other method of keeping a "data base" yields no guarantees. 
SSD doesn't protect you from your primary server become unavailable for any reason (network, OS corruption, power loss). SSD doesn't protect you from a bad data modification. SSD doesn't make it faster to run analytics compared to "just having" them.
