My problem is that the function requires about 100msec for each iteration and I need to run this function about 100.000 times with at least 1000 iterations each time. I have used preallocation of the vectors and apply to speed things up, however its still too slow. 
Over the monitoring period of 100 days, if an event occurs then for that day kkk$positive==1 else kkk$positive==0
Is this possible to reduce the run time of the function? I have tried cpmfun but without much improvement. Otherwise I have to resort to some type of AWS EC2 solution.  
Parallel processing is applicable to my problem as I can split the data on which the function will have to run on multiple cores, however if my calculations are right I need about 120 days of processing pro CPU core. 
The following function, samples k=s.freq=1:12 number of times j=s.length=1:30 consecutive elements from the sample space and checks if at least in one of the samples an event was recorded. The sample space consists of all possible j consecutive combinations of kkk$days. The elements of the sample space are overlapping. Before each of the k=s.freq=1:12 samples, the sample space is reevaluated and elements that have common days with the sampled element are removed before the next sampling occurs (for the total of k samplings).
