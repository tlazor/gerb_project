-Build up the server to their specs, with an agreement that after a month's use you and the customer will look at the performance utilization reports and lower the specs for max efficiency,
Yes as times are changing everyone is talking about virtual. Its not all that different as before though! We still specify pretty much the same sort of requirement ( i dont know your software or application ) but there are a few rules you might want to follow :
Customers (even Service owners within IT) are still not completely comfortable with VMs.  (Many just think they're special; some of them are.)  And they still trust the vendor's recommendations; sometimes the requirements are statistics- and testing-based, but more often the company just asked what they were using internally or would recommend.
-Agree on some mid-way point (say cut memory and CPU in half), and if the server is performing badly, look at the performance monitoring and raise from there.
I usually strongly push the first option because even in the face of fact (performance charts), customers will throw a fit about taking away spec, even if they aren't using it.
CChock's answer is pretty good, but in my experience Hardware Requirements for servers is blown waaay out of proportion.  With the monitoring and performance tools that are built into ESX (what I'm most familiar with...), I have done one of two things:
