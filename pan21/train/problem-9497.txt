I've supported a number of Customers over the years varying in size from a single Windows Server machine and a handful of domain-joined PCs to a Fortune 1,000 company w/ over 6,000 PCs and a couple-hundred Windows Server machines. I haven't seen anyone using, nor used myself, a time synchronization mechanism other than Windows Time for physical Windows Server machines in any environment.
The FINRA "1 second clock rule" is the biggest reason for companies to push for more accurate time synchronization mechanisms and mechanisms that are more amenable to audit. If you're covered by this rule then you should consider whether or not the "Windows Time" service actually meets your needs. If you're not covered then, I suspect, the "Windows Time" service would be "good enough" for you (as it is for many organizations).
Virtual machines have been a different story. In the past, VMware has made recommendations re: using the VMware Tools time synchronization functionality and synchronizing the host with NTP. Today's revision of their recommendations for timekeeping in a Windows environment talk about using the Windows Time service with manually-specified NTP servers.
