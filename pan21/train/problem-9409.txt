In short: you are probably a DoS target. Ask your ISP to do something about it. If you have a professional ISP and have not chosen a cheapo-with-no-service-at-all plan, the ISP tech support will be able to help you quickly.
You likely are misinterpreting the issue - your network is not the origin of the Smurf replies, but rather likely a victim thereof.
Though some dedicated filtering might ease the load on your router (as the auto filters do take up more resources) - it won't be worth the trouble, especially when the attack pattern changes...
If the log message is from your router's logs, it probably is not forwarding the broadcasts. If it can detect threats, it typically also would block them. Also, a Smurf attack typically would be directed against a public network with hosts answering to broadcast pings - something you would not see on modern networks. Last but not least, Smurf ping replies would rather congest your upstream, not your downstream.
As it seems your router is already doing what is neccessary and block the requests - but blocking a request on your side of the network has a significant disadvantage: YOU have to do the filtering, which uses resources - and all the traffic still has to traverse to your side of your network - so your bandwidth get's used up.
