Since this new PC possibly has a dead CMOS battery, and you're having other hardware issues, it could be that your machine is in some way defective. It was were bought as a PC-in-a-box, rather than assembled yourself, then you may want to just exchange the machine for another one at the store you purchased it from.
1) You'll have to do some troubleshooting regarding your graphics card (and different versions of its drivers). I'm not sure anyone can give you one specific answer, as this most likely requires many steps in order to narrow down the exact issues. But, I would start with downloading the newest GPU drivers for the GTX, and maybe one a few versions old, and seeing if one or the other solves the issues.
From some research I saw that other people with this problem uninstalled a certain Windows Update and the error didn't appeared anymore. 
2) Having a dead CMOS battery in your motherboard can cause the time on your machine to be incorrect when it boots or wakes up. A CMOS battery is cheap, and is very easy to replace on Desktops.
The update in question is Platform Update for Windows 7 x64-Edition (KB2670838). Try to uninstall this update and see if this fixed your problem.
