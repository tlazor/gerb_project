I used to have that problem, it means that your IP changed. To solve it, just check it by either going to http://www.whatismyip.com/ or like me, make this batch file:
Next go to Dynamic DNS, you should have the subdomain you created there. Right click Direct URL, and copy the key that appears in the url. Like,
Next install inadyn, this is a DNS updater, what it will do is to make sure it maintains the DNS you choose, just type,
Quite probably the problem is that your external IP has changed since yesterday. Can you check that this is not the case?
i think i can assume the router/port forwarding is working ok - so is it something with the raspberry pi?
Now, we need to ensure that the Inadyn runs automatically after every reboot, run this on the console,
In this case, the easiest way to get things up to date is to configure a Dynamic DNS client on your RPi so at every boot it will update the IP assigned to a hostname of your choice, then you'll be capable to reach your Pi from the outside by using this hostname, regardless of the real IP. 
You can also get a dynamic DNS, there is several ways to do this, I'll give you an example of a free one.
Search for "DDNS Raspberry pi" and you will find a lot of ways and public,free services that provide DDNS.
