And also, this problem is not related to one of my devices as well. When it occurs, it happens on all of my devices that are connected to my network.
I've a fiber connection of 50 Mb/s at my home. The fiber connection is hooked up to the router/modem box of my ISP. But I've disabled the ISP's router/modem's WLAN function through it's dedicated button to disable WLAN and I'm distributing my wireless connection through the latest generation AirPort Extreme by Apple since I enjoy the advantages of the AirPort Extreme.
I talked with my ISP several times and every time they've responded that my connection was fine; that there was no single problem with it.
I can't tell what the problem is from information given, but I solved a similar issue by changing my DNS server. You might want to try following these instructions(google) to use google DNS.
When my fiber got first connected, everything was working fine with this exact setup in place. But now, occasionally, some web pages won't get loaded. Basically Safari gives the "Web page couldn't be found." message for some time, like for couple of minutes, and then when I hit refresh, it gets loaded as usual. Or rather than not getting loaded, the page gets loaded as broken, just text, no styling, and it gets correct after I hit refresh after some time.
