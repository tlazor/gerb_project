Anyway basicly everyone gets the IM client and that ties into exchange and you then use the status to show what people are doing, it ties into their Outlook calendar so if they are in a meeting it will show in a meeting and so on, away when idle for 5 minutes, stuff like that.  Much like MSN, but much more regulated and internal only.
If so you can use the free/busy features of Exchange to do this. It does have some problems, in that it will only show that a user is free or busy, not what they are busy doing. You can read more about it here. 
Don't know what your budget is but you could look at the Microsoft Communications server, can't remember what they call it these days.
An IM client with some integration into Outlook to do the kind of things you're talking about would be pretty neat. Outlook exposes a reasonably complete object model. It wouldn't be outside the realm of feasibility to have a coder take an open source IM client and tweak it up to use information provided by Outlook to augment the presence information the IM client provides natively.
Without writing custom code, I don't think you're going to get the kind of "presence" information you're looking for with a stock Outlook 2007 installation. Microsoft's answer to "presence" is the "Office Communications Server" product, and though I can't tell you a lot about the feature set (because I haven't gotten interested enough in the product to play with it), I can only assume that Microsoft would be focusing their efforts toward doing the kind of things you're describing toward that platform.
