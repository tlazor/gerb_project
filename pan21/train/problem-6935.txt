Hence, I'm stuck logging in as root, exporting my data to /tmp/, then doing sudo cp from another terminal to get my data.  Any suggestions on what I need to do to fix this?
I'm working on my own laptop (no web server or anything) with mySQL.  I'm using mySQL directly from the console client.  Frequently, I want to run a query and save the results elsewhere for further work in LibreOffice or whatever.  I use select ... into outfile 'path+file';.  Even though I'm logged in as myself, I'm unable to save the output file into my ~/Downloads/ directory, which I'm using as a temp directory.  I understand that the mySQL server is running under a special user, not me.  Since I'm the only real user on here, I executed sudo chmod 7777 ~/Downloads, and see it now shows drwsrwsrwt. After the chmod, I restated the server.  However, I still get ERROR 1045 (28000): Access Denied... if I try to output into this folder when logged into mySQL as me. Logged in as root, I get ERROR 1 (HY0000): Can't create/write to file ... when I run the same command.
I know there are already several postings on the stackexchange sites about Linux permissions, but I can't find the answer to my problem.
