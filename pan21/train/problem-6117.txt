My question is, what is the syntax for taking a property tag(such as dcm:SeriesNumber) for every image and using it to rename the images in the directory?
This is not a direct answer to your question, since it doesn't address how you would modify your script using ImageMagicK.  But, I think this could save you, or someone else a ton of time using the best and easiest tools for a given problem.
With both tools, there are a lot of conversion tools included.  But, dealing with tags, renaming files, retagging files is in a different category that these tools excel in delivering.  Find and use the best tool with the lowest learning curve possible for this specific requirement.
I've done a fair amount of work with a bunch of files with property tags, and I've found that, unless you are trying to build a script to automate some process for a regularly occurring job, you'll be much better off using an application made specifically for this task:  ACDSee is a great commercial package, which doesn't have a free version that I know of: www.acdsee.com/ and so is XNviewMP, which is completely free for personal use: http://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/  Both can be installed without malware from the original companies.
I'm guessing it involves breaking it down to the relevant tag using -identify -verbose and then somehow passing that string over to the filename property?
