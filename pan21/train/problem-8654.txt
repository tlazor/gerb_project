If you had previous firewall (iptables) rules set up, you obviously want to integrate this into them.  The configuration above does not really provide an effective firewall (it just forwards the port from the default used for HTTP, 80), but if you didn't have any rules before, then this won't be any different.
You can redirect the standard HTTP port, 80, to one other port using in kernel address translation.  If you want to sort it out into different ports, you need an HTTP proxy server.
If you are also running a web server on the pi, then this will cut it off -- the traffic will be redirected to mopidy instead.  However, you cannot have your cake and eat it too in that case, unless you set up the webserver to redirect certain requests to mopidy.
If you get a "command not found", you have to install the iptables package.  If you get "iptables: No chain/target/match by that name", then the xt_REDIRECT module is not available to your kernel (but is by default on raspbian, so this should not be a problem).
