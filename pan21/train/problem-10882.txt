I have a problem when my Windows 7 64-bit laptop is used during BST (British Summer Time)/ daylight saving periods.
I tried my manufacturer's OEM distribution of Win7 Ultimate, rather than a generic OEM version, having had to reinstall it. So far, I've not had the date jump ahead an hour! How odd.
Is there a fix for this issue? I've seen the issue described in questions and various articles online - but I haven't found a definite fix.
I've used all servers listed in the NTP server list - it makes no difference. I've just tried using pool.ntp.org, but I'm not convinced trying that is going to solve my problem, either.
From what I've seen, this is an issue that affects other Windows 7 users in other time zones, so it's not exclusive to GMT/BST users or users of a particular NTP server. My assumption is that it's something obscure in Windows 7 that's causing this issue.
Instead of the +1 shift in time, the system clock shifts +2 hours and can be a few minutes out from the NTP server time.
