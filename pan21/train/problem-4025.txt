The same goes for invisible scripts used specifically for tracking and analytics. And of course the weather website itself might have collected and provided this data to a geolocation service. (Or be owned by the same company as the geolocation service.)
Most geolocation information likely comes from elsewhere and is unrelated to individual browsing histories. Sometimes the "IP range - location" mappings might even be provided by ISPs themselves.
Ads embedded into that website, however, can retrieve a limited amount of things – for example, the kind of forms that just put the information in the URL, e.g. by redirecting you to http://weather.tld/?zip=12345. Ads embedded on this site can know what main page URL they're running in, and although they don't automatically know what each parameter means, they might guess or if it's a popular weather website they might be specifically coded to recognize it.
Third-party services generally can't just retrieve what you typed into some website – maybe only by literally hacking into the webserver that runs it.
