A client I am working with has a 48-port switch with various wired devices connected to it throughout the building they are in. I am trying to determine what method I should use to monitor network bandwidth. The switch itself is not managed so there is no web interface I can look into. Even if there was, I would rather use a piece of software to diagnose network congestion issues.
The client will be expanding to a second office in the next year, so I would like to be able to monitor that network as well.
I have steered clear of specific product recommendations on purpose, you can get a lot of good results on those products by searching for some of the above terms.
How should I configure the physical cables so I can get a view of ALL traffic wehther it flows through the server or not? Since the switch desn't send packets not bound for a specific MAC to all ports (like a hub does), how can I see everything that's going on? SNMP? Does SNMP only work if ALL devices are using it? Help me steer the boat correctly :).
Since you do have SNMP you could use any number of SNMP capable NMS.  These however will give you per port statistics.  If you want total traffic you could look at Netflow, again several tools are available for this, both paid and free.
Here's my problem. Not all traffic flows through the one server that is present. What is the most efficient method for me to monitor the traffic on the network without slowing things down? If I use a mirror port on the switch (which is Gigabit), wouldn't this total traffic bring down the switch?
Another option is to configure a SPAN or monitor port, and push all traffic to a server connected to that which can then analyse the traffic.
