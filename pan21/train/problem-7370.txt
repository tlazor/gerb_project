Or, create a script on your DB instances that adjusts a Route53 DNS record with their internal IP on bootup, and use that DNS record to connect.
Use an elastic IP address.  Make sure to refer to the server by the elastic IP address's public hostname, not the actual IP address.
Elastic IP addresses will resolve to the internal IP address when the resolution request comes from the availability zone's internal network.  Otherwise, it will resolve to the public IP address.
So when one EC2 instance resolves the elastic IP address's public hostname of another instance that is in the same Availability Zone, it will use the internal address.
However, every time I reboot an instance, the IP address (and hostname) changes.  I could assign an Elastic IP address, but would prefer to use the internal IP address.
I can't be the first person to do this, but I can't seem to find a solution.  There are a lot of "getting started" guides, but none of them mention how to handle changing IP addresses. So what are the best practices to manage master/slave replication in EC2?
