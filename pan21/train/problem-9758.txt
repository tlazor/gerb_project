Look for steal cpu cycles.  You can get this in top for example.  "If your VM displays a high %st in top (steal time), this means CPU cycles are being taken away from your VM to serve other purposes."  
Basically it's extremely hard for a VM to match the real time clock with the CPU counters.  If you have access to install a driver, you should be able to put the system into no interrupts and watch the counters.  If you have a virtualised system then your clock will drift in chunks when the VM is switched out by the hypervisor (which is supposedly impossible based on the interrupt bit).
Is there anykind of benchmarking script (or something analogous) I could run and see the actual performance of the server ?
There are things that were looked at by the antivirus companies for detecting blue pill virus variants.
On Linux, it is possible to look for tell-tale signs of virtualisation depending on the type of hypervisor used. You can typically start by looking in /proc/cpuinfo for the CPU type. Some hypervisors report fake CPU types such as "QEMU Virtual CPU". If it is running VZ, you can find /proc/user_beancounters that report resource usage. With Xen, you will find a /proc/xen directory.
sometimes I feel my server not responding as smoothly as I would expect (i have a Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 2.80GHz Quad Core), given that for example, the 'top' commands reports a low load < 0.5, CPU are almost completely idle ...
I maybe have internet connectivity issues, so I don't really know if it's me or if it's the server itself.
