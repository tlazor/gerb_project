At first try to enable Easy Print on the Server GPO. The policy location is “Computer Configuration -> Administrative templates -Windows Components -> Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host -> Printer Redirection”. The setting “Use Remote Desktop Easy Print printer driver first” must be set to “Enabled” for Easy Print redirection, and it has to be “Disabled” for Legacy Print. For “Not configured”, Easy Print is chosen by default. 
If the above don't work, you had to install the same version print driver on the server and the client computer. Once you install the driver you also need to change again the group policy to disabled at “Computer Configuration -> Administrative templates -Windows Components -> Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host -> Printer Redirection -> Use Remote Desktop Easy Print driver first" so it will map the driver on the client to the one on the server.  Once that is done it prints fine.
We worked with MS and they created a client hotfix that allows (at least HP) printers that use host based drivers to work with RDS Easy Print.  This has been tested successfully in our environment.
