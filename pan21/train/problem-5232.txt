In the Google Chrome Properties window, find the field labelled "Target" and add the above line to the end of it.  If the path to chrome.exe is surrounded by double-quotes, make sure that the above line is added after the closing double-quotes.
For those who don't want to use the flags above and want to disable the cache permanently, I found another way on *nix systems to disable cache. It is possible to link the google chrome cache folder to /dev/null, disabling it. The commands for Linux look like this:
The best way to do this if using Windows is to locate the ”Cache’ folder under “%localappdata%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache. Right-Click, Properties, [Security] Tab. [Advanced] button, [Disable Inheritance], ‘Removal All’. There should be no object listing, click [OK]. [OK] again. Now Chrome wont be able to cache anything. You can do the same to the MediaCache and GPUCache and all other Cache folders as well.
The above line needs to be added to the Chrome shortcut properties.  To find the shortcut on Windows, press the Start button, click into the search window and type Chrome (don't press Enter).  Wait for a shortcut to Chrome to appear.  Right click on it and select Properties.
The most effective way to disable caching in Chrome is to provide it with a cache directory that does not exist.  D.Iankov answer helps but the full solution looks like this:
This should work on linux. I don't know where the chrome cache is stored on mac os, so I couldn't generate commands for mac os.
You need to specify both cache directories to eliminate Chrome caching.  On Windows, use the above line (if you don't have a z: drive) or use any other drive that does not exist.  On Linux/MacOS, /dev/null will work instead of "z:\".
