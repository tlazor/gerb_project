Windows 8 laptop connected to our compary network via Ethernet-cable (internal IP: 129.26...). This connection provides Internet-access and the IP is provided by the company's DHCP server automatically. Using Windows 8 built-in methods, I turned the WiFi-module of that laptop to serve as hotspot, as described here. This way, my smartphone can access the internet via this hotspot-provided WiFi network.
in your case forget about NAT and try bridging in the VM Devices menu switch the Network device to the Wi-Fi adapter and see if it works
On that same windows 8 machine I have VirtualBox installed, running an Ubuntu VM. This guest OS runs a webserver. Using either the "bridged" or "host only" modes of VirtualBox, this allows me to access that webserver from the Windows 8 laptop. However, I'm still unable to access the webserver from the smartphone via WIFI. How do I achieve that?
I want to achieve that my smartphone has Internet-access and can, at the same time, access an apache/webserver that runs in a VM.
