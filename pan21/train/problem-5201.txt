Yes, there are significant improvements in performance, and useful improvements in the user interface as well.  The taskbar now does many of the same things as the Mac OS X dock once you pin applications to it, and you can move or shake an app's title bar to maximize/minimize/tile a window or to minimize all other windows.  7 basucally is Vusta so there should be very few compatibility issues, far fewer than when migrating from XP to Vista.
I upgraded and noticed huge improvements in printer driver support, and have come to love the interface improvements (desktop preview, jump lists, and some of the funny mouse gestures like shaking windows).  Overall, it blows vista away IMO, and if you get it free, no reason not to upgrade.
Migrate to Windows 7. There are no good reasons for staying on Vista unless you have some weird software that you absolutely must use but which doesn't run on Windows 7.
My attitude would be why not upgrade if it's free (or close to it)? Especially as it's a fairly new laptop (with little to backup and move across).
