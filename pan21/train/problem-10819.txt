If you really can't take that much downtime on that array, then you should try to change each disk separately and wait each time for the rebuild to be done but do NOT do that without having a full backup first and, if you intend to keep that system active during the rebuild, make sure you warn the users first that it is possible that they will lose all data after the last backup date and that you got their approval (after all, it's their data and they should be the ones deciding what risk they'd rather take: safe but show with downtime or unsafe but potentially with uninterrupted service).
Ideally, in such a situation you should take the system out of production, make a full backup, delete the RAID volume, change your disks, re-create the array and restore your backup.
100% safe ? no. No operation involving an array rebuild is fully safe, in particular with RAID 5. Will it work ? Probably.
Your problem is that a single read failure during the rebuild will cause the whole volume to fail. And you're going to do it twice, including once with a drive that is already having trouble.
