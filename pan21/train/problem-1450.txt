Modify your Conditions method to be something a little more descriptive.  You should change the signature too so you can pass in the string you're processing.  This will clarify what call is supposed to be doing.
I think you're using too many class variables in this code.  You also have way too many nested ifs.  I have noted below where you should be removing the nesting and why it is not needed.
Start in the GetProfileNames method.  The while the loop works, but it is very messy, and the while(true) statement really confuses the code. I would try something like this, it is cleaner, and probably more efficient
Your DoWork method is a mess.  I would start by adding a return to the if of the error check and removing the else.  I would also stop using the '+' to concatenate strings, this is a very inefficient way of doing it.  My suggestion would be to use string.Format()
Make the error reporting a little cleaner but using helper methods and adding a continue instead of the else statement
I'm not going to take out the next while loop because I don't think I have that much brain power right now, but lets clean it up:
These suggestions just scratch the surface, there is much more I could do to this, but this is a good start.
