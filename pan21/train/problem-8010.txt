had another same model cell phone on cellular one (wireless carrier), the normal cell calls were crystal clear, when hooked to the "setup" it provided dial up modem calls from all around my state and nearby states, as well as long distance modem calls from outside the area
if you could figure out how to convert your data connection to the same signal you would still have to find a audio jack to phone line adapter and then plug it into a dial-up modem, in which you would only be able to achieve the data speeds of the Dial-up modem
if you are talking about converting your phones Data connection to the cell provider into a dial-up signal to input into dial up modem, this may be possible and would probably overcome most of the issues that others are talking about, if you were trying to use the cell phone as a dial up modem that would be a different story.
used a cell phone dock that had connections for an external speaker and external microphone, and then used a heathkit ham radio phone patch to isolate (null)  audio in from audio out and provide a balanced telephone connection.
also had a normal desk phone so they could do test calls thru the setup, if there was a question about it working.
14.4 kbs is the base speed of cellular networks and can usually be used for "free" on an active cellular account. many ways to do this...yrs ago I had a serial connection cable for my cell to plug into my laptop...14.4k was the speed about 1.5 k a sec on the net so slow but ok for email chat etc
made a virtual phone line with filtered dc to make the modem happy, and connected the phone patch to it.

at the time 9600 baud was the norm, would think you could probably get 28,800 or 33.6k out of the setup
While it is impossible to use legacy modems with cellular voice channels, it is, in fact, possible to design a specialized modem which will work over it (more or less by plugging into a handset jack, as OP desires). This is a useful feature, because:
tried it with an ameritech (land line carrier) connected cell phone, the cell phone calls were echoed without the setup and would not do a connection at all with a modem
manually dialed the modem dial up number on the cell phone, had the modem connect with an atdt command that ignored lack of dial tone and dialed one digit.
