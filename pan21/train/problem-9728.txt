You could probably make this work, however you would want to make sure that there were no software compatibility issues, for instance if you want to use CS4 it doesn't state explicitly on the adobe website that it will run on OSX Server.
One important thing: store your shared files in external disk, either FireWire or preferably mirroring NAS. Hard disk is commonly the bottleneck of any modern computer, so using the iMac's internal disk as a shared drive is not good idea and will definitely slow down things.
Either of these servers could be installed on your iMac, or they can be installed on an old Linux machine.  If you've got an old clunker that you can run Ubuntu on, that would be ideal.
I really like Mac OS X Server for a lot of things.  Particularly for Open Directory, User/Computer/Preference management, and Portable/Network home directories.  But for some services, the open-source offerings are simply better.
I'm sure the 27" iMac will serve four people just fine. Quad core and 8 GB of RAM will help, if your budget allows that.
I've used OSX Server for all of the things you listed.  I usually test on Mac minis, and then deploy on Xserves (never on an iMac though).  Regardless, I would not recommend using it as your day-to-day workstation.
However, I'm not sure you need OS X Server at all.  You can use a regular iMac with OS X pre-installed.  Get a big external hard drive and share it using regular file sharing over AFP.  You didn't mention if you want to tie all your user accounts together with Open Directory.  For an office of 4 people, I don't think you need to.  You can easily just create accounts for each of them on your iMac, and they can all log in with AFP.
