I don't think they can sue you over positions. They don't own those pixels and as long as you're not using any of their code/assets/names etc you are fine.
I am planing to develop a game, in fact a puzzle game, I have changed the graphics but the level design is all the same. For example, the original puzzle game have five aliens as the obstacle in the human way to airship, the aliens spit fire on human. So here I have changed the alien to chameleon, with same positions(the aliens position never change so as the chameleon's ) and exact strike range(stick its tongue out to catch) and exact measurement(tile) and also converted the human to honey bee. So my doubt is that will there be any issue on this, for I am rendering the exact level design? ( I have searched, but didn't get a precise answer for my doubt)
You may possibly. I am not entirely sure, but to be completely safe it could be good to alter the positions as well.
The players who would like your game are likely to have played the original, and if they liked the original, they're probably going to think badly of you for having copied it.  If they didn't like the original, they won't like your game anyway.  It's far better, in my opinion, to expand on the original game with your own level designs and maybe some new gameplay elements.  From an ethical perspective, it's also a better idea not to lift so directly from another person's work.
While the other answers support the idea that the legal issues are a bit vague and you're probably fine, there's another issue here.  Ethically, this may be plagiarism.  If you're doing this as an exercise to improve your skills, or replicating a game that is no longer available, it might be fine.  But if you're making a game for general release for love or money, this is a bad idea.
