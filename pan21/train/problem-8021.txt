My work computer still has XP on it, though I will be upgrading to Win7 in a few short months so I've got to make do in the meantime. I just started working at this job, so the computer was a hand-me-down, which wasn't maintained too well on the software side.
At this point, a clean format is not an option. Instead, I've run through all of the quick/easy tricks I know such as using PC Decrapifier, CCleaner, and Revo Uninstaller to get rid of older outdated software, crapware, and start-up apps. I have run through Black Viper's XP Service Configurator, following the "Tweaked" route he describes on there. Also, I have installed all the latest drivers for the hardware.
To fix this close the properties window and right click on the primary IDE channel and select "uninstall", confirm and reboot the PC.
Open device manager, expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, then right click on the primary IDE channel ans select properties, then the Advanced Settings tab, in the "current transfer mode" box it should be udma mode 5, if it is less or PIO mode, this is the cause of the slowness.
Despite all of this, my complete boot-up time is probably around 8 minutes. I can reach the XP login screen within 20 or 30 seconds, but loading XP fully takes the additional 7+ minutes.
