Unlike others here I much prefer to be able to immediately identify a machine and its user, as well as the location, and am more than happy to rename machines when staff changes, rather than put up with a cryptic and hard to work with arrangement. Of course that won't work in all situations but has worked very well where I've worked.
i.e. 044THDBA410211 is in the UK (044), data centre called THD, rack BA41, blade enclosure  02, blade slot 11.
Then the server gets a logical name that typically states the platform it's part of, its OS and it's function but not its location as that will frequently change.
Our servers have two names; a physical one and a logical one. The reason is that cabling doesnt care what a server is, just where it is; and logical names change more frequently than position.
I've only used two different schemes, depending on the scale of the operation. For a small company, such as where I work now, each machine is named after its user. I'm fortunate enough not to have any duplicate names.
For a large global network the scheme was CC-COMP-HOST, where CC is a country code, COMP is a company code and HOST is the machine name. Servers were named sequentially and workstations had a combination of a two character department (or city for small offices) name and as much of a user name as could be fit in.
For VMs we just look in vCentre to find where it is, for physicals and VM hosts we simply have a lookup web page.
So the first laptop with XP3 would be L-000-XP3. The first ubuntu one would be L-000-UBT. It's flexible and provides an easy structure, much better then {companyname}01, 02, 03, etc.
Knowing what OS it is is helpful when/if trying to connect remotely. You can get city (hell office location if not actual desk) from your CMDB by looking up the asset tag number.
