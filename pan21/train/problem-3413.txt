(This is only my guess; I couldn't find any official documentation. I also don't know why Windows refuses to transfer the raw encrypted file – possibly for security reasons, since raw access is not allowed locally either – but then, it does so for WebDAV, why not SMB?)
A possible reason is that the Windows file sharing (SMB) server doesn't have access to your private keys when logging in over SMB and cannot decrypt the file, since the keys are kept encrypted with your password, which is never transferred over the network. (On Active Directory domains, the keys can be retrieved from AD.)
No. The documentation you found only applies to sharing via local media (other users on the same computer, or giving someone a NTFS-formatted USB drive). You cannot access encrypted files over the network on a standalone machine; it's only possible on AD domains.
You could set a VPN between the two computers and access the shared files through the VPN. This will generally provide a layer of 256bit AES encryption. Software like Hamachi from www.logmein.com is a great example of zero config VPN tunneling.
