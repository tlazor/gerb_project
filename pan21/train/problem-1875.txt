I edited the action so, instead of that group, notifications are sent to the two users individually:
I tried that in two ways. First, I created a "Notifications Receiver" group in Zabbix, set that group's read permisssion to all entities, then made the first user a member of that group. That was my initial setup, with only user 1 being a member. That worked. But when I include the second user in that group, Zabbix ignores me and new notifications still get sent only to the first user.
I'm using (and am new to) Zabbix 3.0 on CentOS 7. I successfully created an action that sends e-mail to one user. When a condition (e.g. a filesystem more than 80% full) happens, an e-mail gets sent to that user. But now I want the e-mail to go to two users, not just one.
But Zabbix ignores me. Everything STILL gets sent only to the one user, the first one. It doesn't even try. This screeenshot for the dashboard shows it only sends e-mail to the first user:
Soon after that, the status of the status changed to "Sent" and one e-mail arrived. But it didn't even try to send to the second user even though its media is set correctly, just like the first one:
There were  two things. One is what @Richlv replied above; another is that Zabbix doesn't seem to be reloading its configuration correctly. I had to go to the server prompt and do this:
