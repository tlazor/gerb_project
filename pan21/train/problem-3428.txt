I have done a very stupid thing. I deleted some folders in the C: drive from ubuntu. In result, I cant boot to windows anymore. It starts the boot animation and then keeps rebooting.
I tried checkdisk, sfc/scannow and the automatic repair but it doesnt work. What is strange is that I can boot into safe mode so I think my Windows installation is intact. Also checkdisk and sfc says no errors found. From ubuntu, I only delete Windows.old folder.
This doesn't happen with installing windows on a previous installation and then deleting the Windows.old folder. In this case when you install a windows on a previously installed windows, old windows have the drivers for the current hardware, new windows will always load up from the windows.old folder till you provide a new installation in the current windows (i.e. new windows). And if you deleted that folder(windows.old) without installing the drivers again you would probably have similar problems as you are having. So always try to install drivers for external hardware(hardware having their own drivers CD) before deleting  windows.old folder on this type of installation.
Any suggestions?  Is there anyway I can see the exact error. May be a log file or something. I tried EventViewer, and System32/Logs but everything seems normal.
During a fresh install of windows all the data is deleted and new drivers and softwares are installed. But if any hardware you got with which you got a Driver CD you need to install it again on a fresh install.
