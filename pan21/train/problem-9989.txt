If you need to keep the recovery partition, it'll be complicated and will likely be dependent on the PC model and patch level.
If all of the above sounds overwhelming, don't worry too much about it. If you don't care about the WinRE Tools and BIOS_RVY partitions, you can just wipe both disks and re-install Windows. The worst-case scenario is that you'll accidentally install in BIOS mode (which is sub-optimal but not so much so that it'll be a real problem) to the hard disk rather than to the SSD (which will result in performance degradation, but no more so than what the computer is likely experiencing now).
Given your stated desire to start with a fresh installation, you can do as music2myear suggests: Delete all of the partitions and start over again. I do have a few caveats and suggestions, though:
For the Windows Setup the next option was greyed out for the 3 listed partitions. To proceed, I had to Format, then Delete (1) Windows 10 setup Drive 0 Partition 1: WINRE and (3)  Windows 10 setup Drive 0 Partition 3: Reserved. Afterwards proceed on the unallocated partition. This was successful.
If there is no reason to keep any of the existing data, and you have your own media (don't need the recovery partition), just delete them all.
