NTOSKRNL.exe that is mentioned in the question is just one executable file (having the right format for the OS to open it and run it as a single program). It is not an application software since it is meant for the internal operation of the OS (and hence called system software).
Application software (not file) is software used by end users (as mentioned in the comment pointing to webopedia) which can include one or more executable files, configuration files, data files (internal data), icon files, dll files (or .so for unix), audio/video files, etc. We cannot just take winword.exe in a flash drive and call it application software since it will not even run without the other supporting files. But winword.exe is an executable file.
So, by this definition, the Windows Kernel is a systems software application.  And programs like Microsoft Word is considered application software.  However, I dont know anyone who uses these terms.  People call them programs or applications.
No. The operating system comprises the kernel and system libraries that provide the API (Application Programming Interface) that applications consume.
An executable file is a type of file, just like configuration files (.ini), icon files (.ico), dynamically loadable libraries (.dll), audio files, video files, text files, word document files, etc. In dos and windows, the extension .exe is used to mark a file having executable binary instructions (in a particular format that the OS recognizes). 
So the kernel is certainly an executable, but not an application. This is an argument over semantics, but the word "application" is right in that TLA (Three-Letter Acronym) -- so the argument is pretty clear.
Further suppose that you are running Java, which provides its own API, on Windows. The Java virtual machine and runtime is a Windows application; which itself hosts Java applications. But the Java VM/runtime is never thought of as a Java application.
