With http://Your_Public_IP/phpMyAdmin, Your_Public_IP would be searched from among the named hosts and obviously it won't find it there. So it will respond with whatever is in the DEFAULT VIRTUAL HOST (which you have configured to serve https://monsiteweb.fr).
You mentioned that anyone who points to monsiteweb.fr should be redirected to https://www.monsiteweb.fr. So I assume you don't desire that people using http://Your_Public_IP would be redirected there as well.
Your running VirtualHosts. It's a name-based system. If a request comes the system will look for the VirtualHost that matches the request and it will based it on ServerName and ServerAlias. If the name is not found, the system will automatically respond with the DEFAULT VIRTUAL HOST - 000-default.conf and default-ssl.conf.
First, you should be able to acccess phpMyAdmin using http://127.0.0.1/phpMyAdmin or a local IP http://192.168.0.100/phpMyAdmin (for example).
This will redirect all the traffic except traffic for http://Your_Public_IP. If you use that to access phpMyAdmin it should already work.
Now if you want to access phpMyAdmin using your Public IP, you have to think about possible security issues. You can at least restrict the access to certain IPs and place additional Authorizations.
