I do have folder options set to show me 'hidden and system' files; I've tried using WExp to tell me about large files on the disk of machine 1, sorting for anything from the last month or two, but haven't seen anything significant.
I'm hoping someone can give me other things to check and/or a way to chase down where the disk space is being used up. 
Some of it, I expect, is from the difference between bytes in the file (which SpaceCheck counts) and space occupied on the disk (which WinExplorer may be counting). But I don't think that would account for such a large difference on either machine, but especially machine 1. 
I have two Win7 laptops, and I'm comparing disk usage using different programs and getting different answers.
Below are the figures; the first comes from a right-click on the disk in Windows Explorer and selecting "Properties" and reading off the "bytes" figure (not the "G" figure that evidently uses the 1024 bytes-per-K type reckoning); the second comes from a program I wrote that goes recursively through the directories and counts up all the file sizes per each directory.
