Also check and see if any cables are loose. If they are, some motherboards / Power Supply Units have a safety that just doesn't boot the system if anything is loose.
You might also look for loose power connection to the board, or loose connection from the power button to the board. 
Try swapping out the power supply with one of your other computers'. If it boots you know you just need a new power supply.
Lastly you might try resetting the CMOS. This generally involves disconnecting the power,  removing the CMOS battery (watch-style battery) and then moving the CMOS jumper to the "clear" position for 10-15 seconds before moving everything back the way it was previously.
Most dell motherboards have a LED on the board usually green.  If the light is on then the PSU is fine and its the board.  If the light is not lit then it can be either the board or the PSU.  If you are going to try another PSU make sure the connections match the current unit and the the watts are the same or in the same neighborhood.  Dell uses their own PSU so an after market one will not work with the motherboard.  Dell also has diagnostic lights called the LED pack which is either on the front or the rear of the unit.  Those lights go through a test pattern when you power on the machine.
If it is a 24 pin ATX board you might also try jumping pins 14 and 15 as per the instructions here: http://forums.techpowerup.com/showthread.php?t=25
