You don't need to master any language before jumping right in an making something. Jump right in and learn on the way. It's likely your best option for learning the relevant parts of the language anyway.
I am doing just this in my current job.  Previously, I was doing J2ME and Android development.  I am now in an environment where C# is used for Windows desktop development with a bit of Office interop.  I have no experience with XNA specifically.
If you know Java real good(understand how to use it, understand your basic data structures), and know how to solve problems(programming/software engineering). You should have no problem picking up C#. The language is only a tool.
Overall, I'd say that learning my way around Microsoft's extensive libraries/apis is a much larger job than picking up the language.  You might as well get started coding.
You should be able to dive in and get productive quite quickly.  The similarities in the languages meant that my early java-like code didn't incur performance hits (like it might have in Python for example).
C# does have some fabulous new developments such as Properties, Delegates, and LINQ.  I have found it easy to pick these up on the fly.  It may have helped that I was already a bit cranky about java's callbacks and getter/setter situation beforehand.
