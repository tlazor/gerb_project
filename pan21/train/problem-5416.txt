Alternatively, use their mobile application (I think only iPhone is supported at the moment, though) and sync it to your mobile phone and then transfer the files to/from there via a data cable or wireless pairing.
When you hover a folder in the web interface, you'll see a down arrow to the right. Click it and you'll get the option to download the whole folder as a ZIP file.
As for uploading multiple files, their new design allows that pretty easily, but for folders, I don't know a good way to do it. I can only recommend the mobile application for that as well.
I was looking at how to upload large folders to my online dropbox from my external storage drive without storing them on my computer. 
If you have dropbox open on a computer, you can just drag/drop a whole folder into dropbox (open in your browser), and the upload will begin.
I then uploaded a 600mb folder (full of video and pics) to this folder at online webpage simply by dragging it from my external drive into the Dropbox folder on my computer. 
When finished uploading/syncing to the webpage MyStorageDrive folder, I configured that webpage folder NOT to sync back to my computer (Tray icon/cog wheel/preferences/ selective sync) and then deleted it from my computer.
It saved me uploading about 1000 files separately. I now had all my pics on my external drive and the Dropbox webpage but not wasting space on my computer dropbox folder.
This wont answer your question fully, but will show how to upload a folder with many files in it to your Dropbox webpage without storing them on your computer.
