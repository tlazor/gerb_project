This is a tough one for sure, and I'd (as well) call it 'fixed' by the method you got stuck doing. :)
NB: If you haven't tried it already - check out GetDataBackNTFS.  It's pay-soft, and I'm not sure it's going to help now, but it's still worth adding to the tool cache for similar situations.  Oh and SpinRite if you don't have it.  I'm definatly going to check out Testdisk a little more for my own use.
Make two copies of the damaged image you backed up; one to the target drive and one to another drive ('spare').
Will this work?  I doubt it, but I can't think of much you haven't already tried.  Again, you've done more than most would already, and the small chance for a full recovery may have already been destroyed by things like SMART, auto-run chkdsks and such, before you even got the computer.
Try to repair the target using the Windows CD - Hopefully it can recognize the existing Windows and offer some kind of repair that doesn't involve a format.  If it offers to let you 'upgrade' the existing Vista install, do that. :)
The hope is that you'll end up with a recovered bootable partition, boot sector and Windows boot procedure on the Target, but with a slightly-screwed up file system.  So by copying the files over-top again (form the spare) you may be able to get all the original files back in place, but without messing up the hopefully repaired boot system, and without having to run a chkdsk (which may make things worse in this situation) as the partition table will be properly updated when the files are over-written by the the CD based OS.
Once you got it booting in some form (you might want to take a copy), boot off a CD (Win PE or alike) and copy all the contents from the 'spare' to the 'target'.
