It's not necessary to rebuild AD completely (since you didn't have backups of it) because you can create an LDF file (using ldifde.exe I believe), which subsequently creates the AD account using the Recovery Center in Exchange 2003.  This will match the mailboxes to their corresponding AD account.
In the absence of extreme tricks by wiser minds than mine, you're definitely going to have to recreate that domain in some way in order to convince Exchange that you're legit.
Imagine the havoc if there were a quick & easy way for someone to pull the HDD(s) from a functioning Exchange server and just pluck whatever's desired from the mailboxes?  :)
You are going to have to rebuild an AD domain and reinstall Exchange for the purposes of recovering these mailboxes to export them.  
Since you don't have the original hardware (and presumably don't want to purchase matching HW), I'd create a virtual machine and go through the restore procedure as if it were a clean server.  Pulling the mailboxes out of Exchange by somehow bypassing Active Directory or any kind of authentication would be a drastic departure from the purpose of AD.
