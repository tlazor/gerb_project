Until you have hoards of users, you don't need mountains of severs.  A domain name and a cloud server ought to be about $300/yr to start, but don't go for the lowest price, there are a lot of crappy providers out there.
I've finished working on an RPG and it would seem so much more fun to make it multiplayer. SFML has a networking feature, I figured it's possible but then again, never in my life have I even tried something basic about networking, in fact my knowledge of it is very limited.
you could also consider services like player.io there are a few more, but that one comes to mind. Player IO and some others have a free plan.
What would it take to make a multiplayer game resource-wise? I'm not talking about an MMO, more like a co-op type of game. Do I need mountains of cash to pay for hosting and servers and many many things to make one?
People who invest in their own servers also can sell the data that the users will generate and can also analyze all the stats and infos more effectively; but servers and bandwidth are really not that cheap, so if you do not have enough money do not even start to think about this and follow the ideas given by the other answers.
