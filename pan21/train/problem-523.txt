A coworker has his computer off the network for a while and they removed his computer's access. To get access back, IT had to do "stuff" to it.
But the BitLocker password still didn't work... and the extraordinarily-competent IT people (the same ones who re-initialized the TPM) also lost the recovery key from their database.
Is the TPM relevant to this at all? (does password-protection require both the password to be correct AND the TPM to have the correct PCR state, or is it independent of the TPM?)
How can he unlock the drive with the password? (if the above question is that it still requires the TPM, then this is probably a worthless question because it's impossible)
The company I work for has computers with TPM chips and Windows 10 Enterprise, and uses BitLocker for full-disk encryption. They have BitLocker configured to require a password at boot (which I believe means the TPM is not involved in the decryption, and the disk should only be encrypted by the password itself; is this wrong?).
