In any case, you will only get snapshots on ZFS filesystems and zvols. This feature alone would convince me to use ZFS for as much as possible. Installed the wrong software? Just roll back, your state will be clean again. Boot fails after system upgrade? Just use the last good snapshot 15 minutes earlier, no worries. accidentally overwrote vital system information while editing some files in /etc/? No problem, got you covered.
If you want maximum application performance, you can split your applications and your data - applications on the SSD on any filesystem (because they can be reinstalled easily), data on your pool (because it is valuable). You then use the data either locally or even via NFS, depending on what your applications need.
If you want balanced performance (better pool performance, but not as fast as native access from the second example) and are fine with a reorganization of the layout, you could add the SSD as a separate log device for the ZFS intent log (ZIL), which speeds up synchronous writes. Be careful though, as all data you write to your disks is also written to the SSD, it could die of wear leveling faster than normally.
If you want ZFS just for long-time archival of backups without the danger of bit flips and do not want to change much, you could use your main system any way you want and use checksums (for example md5deep) on your active data, then copy/rsync it to the backup pool, do one more hashing and be done with it.
