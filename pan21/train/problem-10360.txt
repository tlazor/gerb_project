Depending on the model of machine, you may have a Line-in you could use to feed audio from the phone through the Mac, but save for having a client/server app setup, I don’t think its possible.
I'm not sure if Mac OSX supports fuse, however I use this on Linux all the time with different phones.
Every subsequent time you start iTunes it will look there first, then prompt if it can’t find the storage on your phone.
I used to maintain my iTunes library on my work machine this way, using an external USB disk instead of a phone, but its the same principle.
To put it another way, I want to play music via the media player on my phone, and have the music, over bluetooth, come through the computer's speakers.  Like I said, I have a lot of music on my phone and don't want to copy it all to my work computer.
Strange question, so bear with me.  I have a bluetooth device (an Android smartphone, specifically), on which I have a lot of music.  I'm wondering if there's a way to pair up the device and my Mac (which has bluetooth hardware built-in) in a way that the computer acts as a bluetooth headset?
Another option, if the android can act as a dumb USB disk, plug it in via USB, hold Alt when starting iTunes, and create an iTunes library on the phone.  All metadata, etc would be stored and kept on the phone, once you shut down iTunes and remove the phone the machine loses all knowledge of it (short of a line in your iTunes preferences plist pointing at that drive).
