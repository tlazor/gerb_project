The whole point of having CAs, is that I can check your server|client cert. with a 3rd party CA or with myself if I have the CA cert. that your server|client cert. is derived from. Yahoo - as SMTP client - has no insights into whatever my postfix has listed as root CA or CA chain. Even if it does gain such insights, what would it learn - that I made my own CA cert. and from that my own server cert.?
For the record, this is absolutely a Yahoo SMTP issue. They fail to implement opportunistic TLS correctly, and shoot themselves in the foot by sending in the clear (without TLS) when WebPKI authentication fails. That makes no sense, sending in the clear is never more secure, and still not authenticated. Yahoo engineers have on a few occasions promised to fix this, but it has not (August 2018) happened as yet.
Tested by adding my root CA cert. to the miriad of other CA certificates in /etc/ssl/certs, hashing that, and having
Yahoo delivering mail (as client) still fails on STARTTLS, and reverts to clear text mail delivery. Shoot in the foot continues.
