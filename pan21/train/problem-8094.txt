The backstage gets in the way of seeing the document (usually a PowerPoint) when I am using the "Save As" dialog box.  I paste a lot of screenshots into various PowerPoints, and I like to name things descriptively.  However, I can't be descriptive when looking at the backstage.  I would like to look at the actual document when saving the file.  Frequently I find myself saving several different open PowerPoint files and can easily lose track of what their contents are, especially if it's been hours since I made the screenshots.  The backstage adds in several extra steps of trying to save, failing at saving (because I forgot what I was working on), going back to the doc, figuring out a name, then saving again.
I am not a fan of the backstage.  Until today, I didn't even know it had a name (besides "yet another annoying new Microsoft feature").  I would like to disable it in its entirety.  I've come across a few articles that mention disabling it for the Save and Open dialogs, and that works as intended (AskVG).
However, I almost always "Save As" instead of "Save" for a variety of reasons.  There doesn't appear to be a way to remove the backstage for "Save As".
I'd prefer to disable the backstage entirely.  If I can't do that, I would like to  disable it for the "Save As" function.  Is there a way to do either?
I got in a habit of always Saving As because that's how you can version a file.  Also, I'm sure there was a significant element of Microsoft getting in the way, or burning me for just saving and not saving as, though I can't recall at the moment.
Quite late to reply but maybe it helps somebody: If you Save-As by pressing F12 you can bypass useless clicks through the Backstage.
