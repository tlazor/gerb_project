As much as I love to say that graphics don't matter, it's just not true. Not matter how amazing your AI is, the presentation is what's consumed by your viewers. As things being equal the prettier presentation will win out.
I'd suggest pairing with a good artist, and make sure to represent that fact if asked during your presentation. The artist may also want a video of your demo to show potential employers what their art looks like being used "in-game".
That's not to say that you have to present an amazingly detailed piece, just one that looks clean and finished. 
Yes it should look pretty (or not ugly), but don't underestimate siplifying graphics.  A 2D city with 2D blobs moving around is fine, if you're demonstrating collision avoidance. 
You'll also want to pay attention to the erratic movement of your graphical models; even if your path target changes 180Â°, you'll want that change to happen gradually on screen in order to make the movement look natural.
Anywhere that is letting non-technical human resource people judge technical demos sent by candidates is not somewhere that you want to work.
