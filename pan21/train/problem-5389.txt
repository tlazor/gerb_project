At this point in time I am trying to track down a circuit that I saw somewhere here that uses an opto-isolator, a X2 capacitor and a series resistor to detect the Mains - importantly it is the capacitor that is used to drop the voltage/current passing through the LED in the opto-isolator.  As virtually all the impedance in the circuit comes from the capacitor the current and voltage are nearly 90 degrees out of phase and so the power dissipation is very much smaller (though the current is largely the same) than the few Watts that would be lost in the series resistor if that was the right size to put 10 to 30 mA through the opto-isolator LED in a purely resistive circuit.
I have the same sort of issue with my future home automation plans for a Raspberry Pi to control/override some of my Domestic (MAINS!) Lights.  As well as some suitably rated relays, correctly designed to safely operate across a "Mains Barrier" with Mains Voltages on the contacts and low-voltage on the coils I also need to monitor the Mains Input and the three switched outputs (which, as they will be parallel to the conventional light switches in the circuit would still be "live" when the RPi is NOT trying to turn them on if the relevant light switches are!)  
I'm wiring a PI relay in parallel with the room stats (8 stats in total) so that either the room stat or the relevant pi relay can call for heat.
That's all working nicely, but next I would like to monitor the status of the room stats (i.e are they calling for heat with the return wire at 240v)
