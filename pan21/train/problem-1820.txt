The usual remedy to getting more IO bandwidth is the distinctly unmagical "more spindles".  Add more SATA drives and distribute the data across them.
Are you asking what command to type to magically increase your IO bandwidth?  If so, I'm afraid there isn't one.
Striping (in software, using the mdadm tool 1) is the usual way to do this, but that can give you a worryingly-unsafe RAID-0 array or the headache of deciding between, and committing extra discs to, RAID-5 vs. RAID-1 (though it sounds like your application is read-intensive, in which case RAID-5 is fine).  Alternatively, if you know that the traffic is distributed across different directory trees, put some of the busy trees on one drive, and some on the other.
1 Yes, I know it says it's deprecated in favour of the wiki; but I find it a very good guide even now.
I run a fairly busy media site and I store the streamable media on a SATA HDD on the CentOS server. The hard drive is dedicated for just the streamable media. The media is streamed using Flash Media Server. Recently the concurrent connections to FMS has grown and now my hard disk usage is peaking at certain times of the day and causing the streams to slow down or not play at all.
