When I type help in windows command line, it lists a whole bunch of commands. However I find that there is a whole set of commands that do not appear in this list, for e.g. many networking commands such as ping, tracert, arp, netstat, net etc. I am sure that there is also a whole bunch of non-networking command which is also not listed.
So my question is this. Why are these additional commands not shown in help? Is there a subset/group of commands only that help shows? Is there any command/method to list all the commands that can be executed in windows? (I am not talking about additional .exes that get added to path when some new software is installed..)
The commands listed within help are commands that are within the command prompt shell itself. The other programs such as ping, tracert etc are applcations located with the system files directories. You can run dir within the %systemroot% directory if you want to see all the applications. Note: not all applications will run within the command prompt shell or may not have a command line interface.
the "help" command only shows the most basic commands, if it were to list all at once, once would get lost, I guess this is why it only lists the essential onces. 
"help" explicitly excludes network commands. You can find a full list here: http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true
