However the hardware simulated by your virtual machine will not perfectly match the hardware of your original computer. Thus windows will complain about drivers and it will want to be reactivated. This will change the windows installation on disk. When (if) you boot windows natively it will complain again since the hardware will have reverted to native.
Note: Looks like VirtualBox's website is temporarily offline, but it should be in the Ubuntu repos for you if you do not have it.
Yes, it is possible. You already mentioned Vmware workstation. That has a 30 day trail. And the machines it creates can be used in the free Vmware player.

Instead you might consider trying it first with a copy of your installation. Use the vmware converter for this. If that does not work, then:
