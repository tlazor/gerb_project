Then tablet stroked my mind & I felt, for my purpose (of doing Internet) tablet is best. Tablet is cheaper than mobile as well as it will solve my need more than a mobile phone. Now, I'm thinking to purchase Asus Fonopad tablet (7") or Lenovo Idea Tab A3000.
Now, what I want to know is that whether the tablet will run Internet with the same speed as my cell phone. Currently I have low Internet speed. Please note: when I open youtube video on Nokia N73, the video plays very smoothly without any buffering. So, I never felt a need to download the video 1st & then play. Whenever I needed I directly run the video from Internet. But when I connect my cell phone to laptop & then do Internet on laptop using cell phone, I can't think to directly play youtube video on the laptop. As there it's too slow. Hence in laptop, I have to 1st download.
Now please assist me in saying whether I can get the same experience in my tablet as I'm getting in cell phone.
The Asus Fonepad 7 and the Lenovo IdeaTab A3000 support up to 42Mbps on mobile network and also have WiFi.
As Nokia N73 has limited functionalities (like no multi-tasking etc), I thought to purchase a new Android cell phone.
Your internet connection will be much faster and you will be able to watch YouTube videos in a much better quality than the N73 
I had been doing Internet in laptop. Recently I started doing Internet in my cell phone Nokia N73. Because of using cell phone, I got the ease of surfing where ever I go & hence I was able to spend much time on Internet. I realize the benefit of using a mobile device for Internet.
