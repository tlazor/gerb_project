The third and final misconception is the reason for the downvotes - you haven't made the distinction that you are working in a professional environment, and ServerFault is specifically for professional systems administration questions - home networking questions should be directed to our sister site SuperUser. 
I think there's a few misconceptions here. The first is that the reply from text isn't written in the same context as it normally would. 
If you can ping on a direct connection and not via your router, I would suggest checking your router's advanced settings, as some do not allow ping requests on their LAN ports.
Now, the reason why you can't ping both computers could be one of many, many, reasons. My best guess at this stage is that there is a firewall (perhaps a non-standard one) on one or both of the computers that is dropping packets - this would explain why VMs can ping and your PCs can't - so try disabling firewalls on both computers first. 
I would also connect both computers together using a single cable between their LAN ports (this is typically done with a special "crossover" cable, but most modern computers can automatically detect a direct connection and make use of a "straight" cable). This will rule out any issues related to your other network hardware (e.g. your router).
The response is coming from your local IP address because the IP you're trying to ping cannot be found. For more in depth information about the error, see here.
