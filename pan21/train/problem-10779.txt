What better way than trying it out. I was sure of what I've to say, but I did try out scenarios you mentioned. Details below:
Of-course you would not be able to edit the contact's Facebook info, but you can choose between your GMail and Outlook accounts. 
However information from sources remain independent. They are not updated or modified without your explicit consent. 
1) Your Facebook contacts and Google contacts will remain independent and will not show up in other services. I recently installed Windows 8 Pro and connected Facebook, Google, Outlook and few other accounts. My Google contacts page continues to show only my previous GMail contacts and Facebook contacts are not listed.
So its absolutely safe to connect all of your accounts in Windows 8. It would enhance the experience and at the same time, cause no trouble!
