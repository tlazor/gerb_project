If you want more realistic mechanics, then don't play games like CoD. Try games that have a lot more depth instead, like Rainbow Six.
Simplifying the mechanics also helps to level the field between new and advanced players, which makes it more inviting to new players. This is especially true for tournament style FPS games.
It's the same reason that most packaged foods are bland: because they are trying to find the middle ground that appeals to the widest audience. Anytime you make something appeal to the average, you end up with something average.
Most FPS games are not made for technical accuracy. Most are made to be mindless shootem-ups, made for mass consumption. While some players may not like the auto-reload, they are a minority and when it comes down to dollars and cents with a target demographic of probably 12 to 18 years old, who is the developer going to cater to? The abundant, trigger-happy gamers who get their kicks from simply blowing stuff up or the hard-core few who get their thrills from perfecting advanced tactics? It's a very different experience. Most gamers don't like having to think too much.
