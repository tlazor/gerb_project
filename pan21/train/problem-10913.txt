when i try in IE of firefox i can't get past the previous page, when i try in googele chrome it goes blank and gets no further. 
You are not alone. I've been having problems bringing up pages on the Apple web site for the last few days. Today though it (finally) seems to be working fine. So perhaps ... try it again? 
If you think it may be a problem with a DNS server you can also try using an alternate DNS server such as OpenDNS or Google.
If all other sites are working for you and only the Apple site is having problems it is probably something Apple knows about, is working on, but just doesn't want to talk about to avoid bad PR. IMO.
[i have a whole lot of half-installed apple software on my PC, like iTunes and stuff (i replaced the drive windows was on, but a lot of the software was installed on another drive), but i don't know how that could stop me getting to the website.]
If you don't see something like "Reply from 96.16.93.15: bytes=32 time=6ms TTL=57", then it's definitely a network issue. In this case, you'll need to contact your network administrator or ISP to get help resolving the issue. In the meantime, try rebooting and/or waiting a while.
i can get onto heaps of other websites, i can even get onto apple's on line computer catalog, just not iTunes or any of the other pages of the site, My friend i was talking to on-line said he could get onto the iTunes page, but i can't, i can't work out what's going on.
i've tried 3 different browsers, i've tried clearing the cache, and i've tried turning allm hardware off and on again
