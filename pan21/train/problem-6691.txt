There does seem to be some way to do it, though, because if you open the Organizational Chart, there's an option for a "Coin": 
Is there any way in Visio to draw a shape, fill that shape with an image, then resize that image to fit well within the mask? If the functionality for this doesn't exist, then Visio simply isn't the tool for me, which is fine. But it does make the diagrams pretty easy.
I'm making a document in Visio where I'd like to insert a picture of a person, but masked so that it is within an oval. I could edit each picture outside of Visio to be an oval, but I'd rather not do that. Basically the only option I've found online is this guy's: http://www.visguy.com/2007/07/29/masking-images-in-visio/
If your shapes don't have to be right next to each other, what about creating a knock-out of an oval in a larger background colored square (turn on developer tab in File>options>advanced>general, create both shapes, set fill to white, line to none, enter align H&V, developer > shape design > operations:combine)? Paste your picture over the square and "send to back" and only the oval picture remains. Group the picture and the shape so they move together. 
To minimize the extra work for future projects, use the custom connector tool to add connectors to the knocked-out middle instead of the edges and save the shape as a stencil then when you want a new one, drag it onto the page.
Where he describes making your image a custom pattern and filling a shape with that pattern. That's...bad. I'd rather not have to do that for every image.
There are a few problems with this, though - every available coin has text in it, and has protections so you can't remove it. I've attempted to mess with the protections or edit the master, but it won't let me. Also, you can't move the image around within that cut-off circular frame - instead, it fills the frame with the image and that's it.
