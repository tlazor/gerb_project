Before I suggest something "TUX has never been an integrated part of the official Linux kernel". Are you sure you want to maintain kernel patches on your own?
I'm a bit curious here: What do you expect of incoming requests per second since you need a HTTP engine running inside your kernel? Isnt tinyhttpd fast enough?
You could try something like this, which I wrote to roll my nginx logs. I looked for some details on the tux userspace process but couldn't find any way to get it to reopen it's logs, so you may have to resort to stopping and starting the process.
Personally I'd try to create a pipe which tux writes to and then use rotatelogs (from apache) to handle that stuff. Maybe even logger so that it uses syslog directly.
rotatelogs can handle time or size based rotations for you, if you don't send the logs to a central logging server I'd use that, if you do send to a central logging server I'd send it to syslog, just let syslog create another socket which tux will write to (preferrably /var/log/tux), and syslog should handle the rest for you...
