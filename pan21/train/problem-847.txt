It's also possible you have some implementation detail slowing down your results but that is impossible to tell without code to look at.
Likely it looks ugly because you have problems like shadow acne and peter panning, it is likely not aliased either. OpenGL-tutorials.org has great tutorials for shadows. Even if you're using DirectX. Here is the link.
I would not necessarily say it is too slow if you are getting 90 frames per second, though. When you have nothing going on in a scene it's very common to go from a very high frame rate to a much lower one. Yes, in a sense 4/5 of your power is going to shadows, but it is a relative measure not an absolute one. It doesn't mean that you can't still add all the stuff you need to onto the screen without going under 60 fps.
This tutorial is pretty good for covering basic shadow maps and you can tell the performance is good.
There's also cascading shadow maps you could look into, but as I said any other kind of shadow map will be even more expensive.
For talking about quality, it is too vague to just say they look bad. Likely you have something wrong like shadow acne or having too low of a resolution.
