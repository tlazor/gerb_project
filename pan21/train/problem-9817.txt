We beta-tested the 55xx series Xeons over the winter in a range of scenarios, including W2K8/IIS7. I can categorically state that for that software stack you will get significantly better performance for multi-site web hosting using the 55xx Xeons over any other mainstream processors, including AMDs Shanghai.
I'd be inclined to choose the 2x nelaheim processors configuration. You've said you'll be running a lot of websites which can translate to a lot of web application threads, and 2 4 core processors translates to a lot of multi-tasking ability, and the throughput on the newest intel processors is much improved over their older processors. You should also see some very good memory performance from that architecture too, which should help with serving website content nice and quickly.
Whether they're better 'bang for the buck' is a different matter, only your own calculations can answer that because your discount levels will be different from mine, but you can be certain that a single E5504 will shred an X3363 in almost any multi-role environment.
