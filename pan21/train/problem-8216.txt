Unlike some of their other products, Microsoft seems to want to encourage anyone to get and use their development tools - there's a free version of Visual Studio, which has most of the functionality you'd need, so if they can get you to purchase an "upgrade" licence, they're ahead of the game.
But really anything could be considered a developer tool, such as Notepad++ or Kaxaml. How has this worked in regards to previous upgrade versions?
In reality, I think it won't require anything installed, but from a legal standpoint, is this inclusive with development tools such as Eclipse? After installing Windows 7 on this PC, Eclipse is currently the only IDE I have installed.
A couple of months ago on their site they basically said anyone qualifies for the upgrade - you can use Perl, Python, anything at all.  They also said they don't check for anything being installed prior.
I'm wondering this from a legal standpoint and an installation-issue standpoint. I'm considering pre-ordering Visual Studio 2010 for future use in some home projects, and you cannot pre-order a full version, only an upgrade version.
