Double-check your search criteria, perhaps you have excluded folders, for example by specifying a size (by definition, folders have a size of zero bytes).
I think you are looking for "Windows Search Advanced Query Syntax". If you have installed Windows Search (and not using the original search function), do your search and add kind:folders
If you only want to search for folders, you can expand the Advanced Options and select Folder in File Type.
You should be able to find folders that match your search criteria (eg filename, date) by searching just as you would for a file; the results list will include both matching files and folders.
Perhaps you are using the second editbox, that is used for search a text inside a file; as folders itself does not have text in it, but in the files inside it, you are only seeing files.
In Windows XP, go to start menu and then select search (other ways: F3 on desktop or in Windows Explorer).
In the first editbox, you can use for search for files or folders by their name, part of their name or wildcards that match file or folder names.
If all you are trying to do is search for folder names, they will come up regularly. If you are trying to search in a specific folder, you have to click the browse button.
