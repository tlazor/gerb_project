I'm putting servers on a rack for the first time, and am thinking a 4-post open frame rack is adequate for my needs.  I'm putting in a few HP DL 385's and a few other things.  What I'm wondering is if there's reason to be picky about the rack selection.  I'm not concerned about heat or size - just installation and fit.  Any recommendations or considerations?
Not joking here either if you are going for a freestanding rack make sure it has some kind of stablization (some people call it a kick-stand lol), epsecially if it has wheels.
I don't have any specific recommendations that haven't already been covered but when I was faced with a similar situation I paid a visit to a local company (Hallam Oz) that makes racks and rack fittings. They will even custom make them if required. On that visit I took a slide with me so that I could actually see how it would fit. It seems that apart from the more obvious issues, such as the holes, the pillars come in a variety of profiles and not all slides will readily mount all racks.
When you bend down to pick something off the floor make sure that the rails are pushed back into the rack.  I made this mistake once and stood up into the rails resulting in my one and only IT injury stitches to the head.
