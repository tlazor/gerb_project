Currently using a T1 (1.544Mbps) for what I think is pricey sum of 500 a month. Found I could get 30/30 fiber for about the same price. Would there be any downside to switching to fiber, I would think it's better, since we can merge VOIP with daily Internet, using QOS on VOIP. Am I wrong to think this? The T1 is dedicated VOIP, we also have a 80/5 cable which is currently being use for normal internet data. 
Dedicated Ethernet is typically point to point with a provider's head-end, and provides you with consistent speeds, an SLA and sometimes QoS (but not always).  You could use bandwidth management to slice off 5 Mbps of traffic dedicated for voice, and use QoS on the switches to ensure better packet delivery  and lower latency.
Then there's Business Class Internet, which essentially means you don't have the limitations as a resident, but you are still a consumer grade connection.  The ISP provides a service, it's usually good, sometimes it's bad, you can do bandwidth management again, but at the end of the day it is what it is.  
QoS Lines, this are dedicated lines that can be over fiber, or another transit like coax, the service comes with an SLA and in guaranteed.
