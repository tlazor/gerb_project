I have had windows 10 on a partition for a while, but I am very new to using it. I noticed today that I was missing a lot of space on that partition. When I opened the Storage settings to try and figure out where all of the space as allocated I noticed that the Windows system files were taking up a huge chunk of space. 
That is 4 times the amount that i have and ive had it installed for quite some time. I am using version 1809. If I remember correctly in version 1903 and ongoing they introduced a feature that reserves a certain % of your hard drive so that windows updates can always have room to install. I would also check how much of what data is in there for cache and old windows updates and maybe even windows upgrade files by using disk cleanup and seeing the breakdown there.
It is very unusual, might be if you upgraded any old version of windows or somehow because of dual booting(assumption).
Is this correct for a Windows 10 installation for a single user? I can't figure out how to get this space back and none of the answers I get from googling solve the problem and most are over a year old.
