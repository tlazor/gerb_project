If in doubt always feel free to set something on fire, it appeal to our caveman side and is one of only two ways to know for sure...
I see 2 options here. 1. The copier has a built in DoD standard wipe program(several full disk writes and deletes) 2. Physical destruction with the methods we all know and love. Degausser, sledge hammer, drill, vehicular action, target practice with your 44 holo-point, ect...
Clearly you do not have a sharp tech that you want to hire and you are not on a service contract. As such I assume you are ok with using a screwdriver to open up the machine. Each machine is unique but if you review a similar video such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s_TcQrGVhQ you might be able figure out how to get into the device. A hard drive is the same whether it comes from a computer or a copier. Take it out and then use a computer as described in some of the other posts to reformat it completely such as using the shred command listed in another post.
I can't help you with details of how to actually remove the disks, you'll need the manuals for that, but if you're concerned about the contents of the disks then I'd suggest throwing them on a fire, the heat and magnetic field will see to the contents.
