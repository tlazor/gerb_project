You can put the keys in a solution of rubbing alcohol and water, but I do not recommend putting any electronics in water, ever.
What I did in the end was wash it manually, it was amazingly easy to disassemble the plastic from the electronics and when put in warm (almost hot) water with A LOT of soap they practically cleaned themselves. The upped and lower side were put in a tub filled with the same hot water tons of soap solution and I'll use air pressure to clean the dust from the PCB.
The important thing is to make sure it is absolutely and totally dry before applying power. What I did was hang the electronic parts outside in the sun for several hours, while drying the key caps by hand with a towel.
It is possible to wash a keyboard in a dishwasher, and I've actually done it. Obviously you can't wash anything with a battery in it (or that has large capacitors on its circuit board, which also store a charge), and you can't wash anything small and loose, like screws.  The key caps can be secured and washed in those plastic baskets designed for baby stuff. The more you disassemble it the cleaner it will be. 
Does your keyboard have springs inside of the keys?  They might rust if put in contact with water.  I vote manual treatment.
