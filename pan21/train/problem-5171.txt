The company I work for has been using an Access database for the past eight or so years (I've only had to put up with it for five). We're beginning work on an online ordering system so it's about time (actually, well past time) to move on to something more robust. We have a SBS 2003 server with MSSQL 2k, and we also have a MSSQL 2005 database through our web host, so SQL seems the way to go.
I would switch to a dedicated or VPS hosting. Using shared hosting opens yourself up to possible problems from other clients. As you already have seen, other people might have access to your DB that shouldn't be there.  The host should never allow other people to view other client's databases.
People have been trusting data centers with data for decades now. I think it's safe for you to go ahead and use the host. If you make a copy locally for backup, it automatically facilitates the positive of redundancy in a remote location. You won't gain much speed with it being local compared to remote unless your connection is poor or there are existing bandwidth issues.
Shared hosting is ok for non-critical sites, but if you want to protect your data and site, I would opt for a dedicated server.
2) Internal SQL database for day-to-day operations. Replicate what's necessary to support the ordering system to the online database.
I've thought of a few scenarios for how to handle this and would appreciate any input SF has to offer.
