If I purchase something, I expect to choose. There are very rare exceptions, such as sneak previews at the local cinema and raffle tickets, but the general expectation is that the person spending currency (whether real or in-game) has the choice what to spend that currency on.
Your first stated concern was with the route of choosing your character, as is may cause choice paralysis. This can be solved by adding filters to facilitate player choices. You could allow for search queries that show you characters who have specific pros and lack specific cons, etc. This is beneficial for a number of reasons:
The reason you gave for leaning towards randomness at all was that it would be a quick and easy way for casual players to get a new character and move on. But this ease can easily be preserved in a player-choice system by adding a "Unlock Random Character" button!
I would point out that there are ways you can build in-game systems to address both of your concerns.
In fact, if you were to combine the aforementioned search query with the random button, allowing the player to say, "select a random character with this pro/without this con," you can even avoid the potential scenario in which a player pays for a character that does not suit his/her playstyle, even if they let the computer choose a character for them.
An simple example could be the “Mystery Box” in Call of Duty Zombies, people love it and at least in the early days it might’ve been one of the things that fueled the success of the game mode.
I’d say random character is the best choice and I might go as far as saying it will result in more money.
So I would go with the random system, and despite the bad press and all, players still get hooked, meaning they don’t have a problem.
The way human psychology works and why gambling industry is so popular is exactly that, the random chance.
