I don't know anything about the toner refills, but the ink jet refills generally work and are also generally safe, if you get the correct kit for your printer. The only issue that I have encountered with them is that the colors make come out a little off because the ink formulation is not exact (this is especially true refilling HP printer cartridges).
I use the toner refills and I am happy to report they work fine. The refilling does need to be done with care because toner dust is an irritant, so you don't want it spilling all over the place. Fortunately toner refills usually come with plastic gloves, a funnel and full instructions.
Through the use of toner cartridges, and forcing your printer to keep going until the toner really is empty (cover the sensor holes with tape: until printing quality noticeably diminishes, don't waste your money on a refill), you can reduce your printing costs considerably. I run a sports sunglasses supply business and we use our little Brother printer a lot so keeping the cost of these consumables down is vital.
My mother needs to print photos of the family, but since photos have 100% coverage, the ink cartridges run out quickly. Buying new cartridges is far too expensive (it would be significantly cheaper to just have them printed at a photo shop). So as an alternative, we are looking at ink refill kits.
