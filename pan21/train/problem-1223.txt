Your agg CTE has a TotalVotes > 0 as a WHERE condition.  It would probably be more efficient to test for (UpVotes > 0 OR DownVotes > 0), because that has a possibility to take advantage of an index (though we don't know whether the Users table actually has such an index in SEDE).
select distinct should be replaced with a smarter join wherever possible.  If you look at the execution plan, you'll see that it estimates that there are 3 million rows, when there are actually just 26740 Code Review users.  The estimated subtree cost is 1048.  In comparison, my query below has an estimated subtree cost of 5.7 and 27580 rows for Code Review, and those numbers scale depending on the size of the site.
It would be nice if the usernames were clickable.  You can achieve that using the magic [User Link] column.  It might make the query fail to complete on a large site like Stack Overflow, though.
It's weird that you cast(VotesPerDay as int) and cast(LastAccessDate as date) for sorting.  Why not sort by VotesPerDay (without rounding) and LastAccessDate directly?
