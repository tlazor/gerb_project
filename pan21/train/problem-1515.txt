mount or df will show you the filesystems that are mounted.  fdisk is just showing that the devices are physically attached (which is of course, a good first step :))
Additionally, if you want this mount to happen automatically upon reboot, then you should add an entry in your /etc/fstab.
There are a couple things that can get in the way here.  If /var/www2 doesn't already exist, you have to create the directory.  If it does exist, you don't want any content in there, because once you mount a filesystem at that location, the original contents won't be accessible any more.
are they both already mounted? Since it looks different than it usually does. And if the second one isn't how can I mount it to a var/www2 folder?
Your filesystem is formatted as NTFS, which typically means you'll need a package for ntfs utlities (ntfs-3g on fedora, don't know about debian).  If this drive is only going to be used on this box, I'd recommend formatting it w/ EXT, because using windows filesystems on linux is going to be a pain as the permissions are completely different.
