But there are other methods! rsyslog is very robust!   rsyslog also offers Kerberos encryption, plus TLS.  Just make sure it's configured securely.
To quickly get it working you can edit /etc/audisp/plugins.d/syslog.conf.  RHEL includes this by default, though it is disabled.  You need only change one line to enable it, active = yes.
But this is not very secure by default; syslog is an insecure protocol at its base, unencrypted, unauthenticated and in its original UDP specification, completely unreliable.  It also stores a lot of information in insecure files.  The Linux Audit System handles more sensitive information than is usually sent to syslog, hence it's separation.  audisp-remote also provides Kerberos authentication and encryption, so it works well as a secure transport.  Using audisp-remote, you would send audit messages using audispd to a audisp-remote server running on your central syslog server.  The audisp-remote would then use the audispd syslog plugin to feed them into the syslog dameon.
