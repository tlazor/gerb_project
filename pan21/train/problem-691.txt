What is mysql doing? Do you have mytop installed or can you check the output of show processlist in mysql?
tail -f /var/log/mysql.log will let you follow whats going on in the log file. With that load there might be extreme amounts of logging data though to go through.
If you can post the output of "show processlist;" to your sql server while apache is shut off (assuming this is a non-critical machine), that might help shed some light on what is being queried to mysql.
Pretty impressive for 3 minutes of uptime.  Were things running fine and dandy before?  If you shut down apache and waited, and mysqld CPU usage doesn't go down, and both services are on the same box, I would guess that someone else is querying your server.  If that is so you may want to close that mysql port from the internet.
I know i'm making a lot of assumptions but under normal conditions with both services running, it would seem to me that your website is bogged down and is either popular or there is some major spamming going on.
the answer was a corrupted index or some-such. I recreated the db then copied over the data and it worked.
