It really doesn't matter when you format the regular HDD if you want TRULY want a clean install. Format it before, after, during, it shouldn't matter if you don't need anything off of it.
You will also want to format your old drive. This can be done by opening My Computer, selecting the old drive and clicking Format in menu.
Just install the SSD. Boot the computer from your Windows 7 disk, format both drives, and select the SSD when you choose to Install it.
I'm planning on upgrading my PC with an SSD. I currently have a 1 TB HDD, and I'm planning on installing a 512 GB SSD. I am also planning to do a clean slate install: I won't be transfering my current Windows installation. I haven't bought the SSD yet.
Get it to around about where you want it by installing various programs/features/updates/etc... That way if the Windows OS has trouble activating you can still recover the Product Code, same applies to software you may or may not have purchased and is being stored on the HDD.
The Computer Repair tech in me suggests WAITING until you've reinstalled the OS onto the SSD. All too many times I've heard people claim that "they want a clean install" but then ask where their MS Office, QuickBooks, Outlook (yes people still use this) data is.
I have a few questions about this and since they're likely related, I found it easiest to ask them at the same time:
Aside form the fact that most of the question is entirely unnecessary, a Solid State Drive doesn't have any moving parts and isn't going to be a/effected by dust or the lack thereof. So yes, you can install it right after cleaning. 0.o
No need to boot the computer after cleaning it especially if you aren't planning on keeping any of the existing data.
