Since this was technically never answered properly for others who may be interested in the same thing, here is the answer:
Right now I have a fairly standard video card with 2 DVI ports, one powering my single monitor and another powering my HDTV (with a DVI-to-HDMI cable), which are in separate rooms.  I never need to have my monitor and TV active at the same time.
So 1x Display + 1x DVI + 1x HDMI is possible but not 2x DVI + 1x HDMI. Note that a displayport-> DVI/HDMI Adapter will count as HDMI/DVI and not as displayport. See ATIs FAQ on this: http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-eyefinity-technology/how-to/Pages/faqs.aspx#how-many-monitors
Yes, this is quite possible. Since the DisplayPort is required for your triple-display setup to work with Eyefinity, you will still have a free DVI or HDMI (on most if not all cards, this is actually just the output of a built-in DVI>HDMI converter) port. So assuming the remaining monitor or TV  has the respective available port and you have the necessary cables and adapters, if necessary, then you will not need any "special" hardware to do it.
I'm looking into a possible computer upgrade.  I'd like to know if the following situation is possible.  I want three monitors on my desk powered by a single card, which I hear these new Eyefinity cards are capable of.  But, I also want my TV hooked up.  At any given time, I would want either my three monitors active or my TV active, never both at once.  So it seems to me it might be possible to do this all a single 3-port card with a splitter of some kind.
Keep in mind that when using Eyefinity for the triple-display, the remaining DVI/HDMI-connected display will have no signal.
The ATI cards only support two "old world" interfaces at a time. (5xxx Series) Old world is everything which is not displayport.
