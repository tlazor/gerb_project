As noted by megamorf, you need to recursively query group membership information for each group.  My company's product, Carbon, is a web-based LDAP management tool that, among other things, can display nested group membership as a graph.  Since it's web-based, you can use it from a Linux (or Mac or Windows) box as long as you have a supported browser. Check it out at steelhive.com. There is a free demo you can download.  It comes as an OVA / virtual appliance targeting VMware ESXi 5+.
It's pretty annoying to do with old commandline tools but the ActiveDirectory Powershell module that you get with the Remore Server Administration Tools has an easy way of returning all nested group members:
Here's a kb article that explains the command: https://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/library/ee617193.aspx
Determining nested group membership can be tricky with pure LDAP queries.  Note that memberOf is a constructed attribute.  Further note that primaryGroupID is only that, an ID.  While the MMC will show primary groups in the membership tab of an account, the distinguished name of an object is not actually placed in the member attribute of that group.
