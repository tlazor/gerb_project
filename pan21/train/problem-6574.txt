Since Vista has been supporting pretty much all of the required audio processing on the CPU rather than using the sound card, the only reason I can imagine for a sound card is better shielding to avoid noise, or higher bitrate / sample-size support.
Personally the only concession I have made is buying a set of USB headphones with an in-line sound module in the cord, so that it is external to the case where most sources of noise are, and I have not looked back.
The only nitpick I have is that it didn't come with a remote control, but for less than $40, I didn't really expect it to. It's not a necessity for me really anyway.
Its common for me to have 3 or more operating systems installed on my machine. My sound card has worked with every one. Linux, Windows 7, Windows XP, FreeBSD, Solaris... it's worked flawlessly on all of them. Albeit you might have to do some driver hunting, but it works perfectly fine.
I'm currently running the Sound Blaster Audigy SE by Creative. It's an excellent little budget PCI card if you want a little step up from onboard sound. Never had a problem with it, I actually kept it from my last build.
