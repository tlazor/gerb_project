No, it would not, because "Compression software works by using mathematical equations to scan file data and look for repeating patterns. The software then replaces these repeating patterns with smaller pieces of data, or code, that take up less room. Once the compression software has identified a repeating pattern, it replaces that pattern with a smaller code that also shows the locations of the pattern. For example, in a picture, compression software replaces every instance of the color red with a code for red that also indicates everywhere in the picture red occurs." - http://smallbusiness.chron.com/file-compression-decompression-930.html
The other chances are: that you experienced a hard-drive damage, sometimes the system used some space in the file to write other files that causes the problem; Or you experienced a virus attack;

But when you put something or take out something from the archive, it can also be done with modern archive managers, like: 7-zip... In this case, you may corrupt a file.
