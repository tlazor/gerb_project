If the old adage "they don't build 'em like they used to" is true in this case, I'd be interested in alternatives. At least three buttons (X, Smalltalk), a ball that spins for quite a while and it should work at least in Linux and OS X (10.6), Windows 7 wouldn't be bad, but not required.
And as Kensington just has a mail-in rebate offer, I thought about buying a Kensington Expert Mouse. This used to be a pretty good model, and I dimly remember admiring the feel of its OS 2 / ADB predecessor. But the stories one hears about the current crop are pretty mixed. Apparently the build quality has been steadily going down since the '90s. 
After messing around with a few mice and the trackpads of various laptops, it's time to get back to using a proper input device: A trackball. I used to be very happy with my old Logitech Marble trackball (PS/2, three buttons, "white"). But that's really showing it's age, USB converters are a bit flaky and I think it would be better not to operate the ball with my thumb.
