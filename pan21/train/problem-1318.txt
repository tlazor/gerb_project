As for the idea with PC â€” take in account, that hardware router, takes only few seconds to fully reboot, while even trimmed down Linux/*BSD router distribution would take a minute or so. Unless you need sophisticated firewall, transparent proxy etc., there is no point.
For my home network, I have had good luck with the Apple AirPort Extreme 802.11n access points (both single and dual band models). It does a great job with 10 devices connected (ranging from 802.11b to 802.11n at 5GHz). 
My experience with Linksys routers in networks of exactly that size has been stellar. Two WRT54Gs each running at hundreds of days of uptime. A WRT160N that would stay up all the time if the modem didn't keep dying (and the end users try to reset the router to solve the problem.
If you really want to segregate your wireless users, connect the wireless APs to a DMZ subnet / VLAN of their own.
Consider if it's worth your time to go through the trouble of configuring pfSense for your situation or if a mid-high end consumer router will do the job.
pfSense certainly looks desirable but I'd be concerned about the ease of setup. More importantly, WAPs (unless you spend a decent amount of money) are generally junk. If you're going to spend enough to get a good WAP, you might as well invest the cash in a higher-end consumer router and save yourself the setup.
For my own home LAN I run a WRT54GS with Tomato firmware. It's been running for over a year without an issue.
For my own personal use I use Apple's Airport Express units (CA$109) - the little ones with iTunes streaming capability built in and 802.11n.
They'll operate in bridge mode very happily, and also support handover / wireless extension pretty well, so if you need to cover a larger area, just plug more into the LAN.
