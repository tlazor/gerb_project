Especially since your server is your only one. SBS will potentially die in the process, and leave your business high and dry.
Here's the options as I see it. One, make sure you have known-good backups, and verify that your p2v migration will support sparse disks, since if it will create the same size volumes you're going to have a size crunch. Then you can allocate a few days to trying it, and if it fails horribly, restore the computer back to the previous state.
Three, don't do this, unless you really have a compelling reason to move to a virtual system structure. What are you doing that you are running with SBS, but want to virtualize on that server? Especially if you don't have extra hardware for availability/redundancy? If you do idea two, you could migrate your server, make sure it works, and then turn the old server into another virtual server and install a backup DC and...something else you're trying to virtualize.
The smarter thing to do is get a newer server dedicated to virtualization, then migrate your existing server over and decommission it. 
Two, which I'd say would be safer, get a server with tons of storage dedicated to being a VM server, migrate your server to that, then decommission it once it's working well. Then turn your old server into a backup domain controller. Even for small business, it doesn't hurt to have 2 DC's.
It should be possible, but it's difficult without knowing for sure that your hardware is is supported. I'm not going to say that it will work only to have you hit a snag and have it not work, then complain...in some circumstances it might.
