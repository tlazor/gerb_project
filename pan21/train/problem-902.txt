Having used a few, I'm going to have to disagree.  The specs are attractive, but when you actually sit down and use one, the user experience is sluggish.  Really nice form factor for applications where you don't need the speed.  However, for a primary desktop, it's not exactly ideal.
Judging by the specifications it can sure function as a desktop PC if you wanted it to! A quick glance over the "Graphics and video support" section suggests that it does in fact support multiple monitors.
You probably want a USB (or preferably FireWire) external hard disk, though. The internal disk is smallish and slowish. There are nice enclosures available that fit in with the Mini's design.
I use one as my main web development machine at work, usually simultaneously running Safari, Firefox, Textmate, Sequel Pro and Versions, plus non-development stuff like Tweetie and Adium. Other than the odd beachball here and there (it’s an older model with just 1GB of memory), I’ve had no problems so far. You’ll probably love it, just max out the RAM if you can afford it, and you’ll be fine.
