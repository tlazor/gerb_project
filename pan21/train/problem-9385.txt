The CA certificate is used to guarantee that you are connecting to the correct server. Otherwise, You may try to connect to a fake WLAN with the same name as yours (you think it is yours because it has the same name) and that WLAN is connected to a fake server that will steal your identity (username, password...etc.). The CA certificate file you put here (in supplicant config) is generated by the server and guarantees that you are authenticating through the correct (not fake or illegitimate server). That's why you'll find that the certificate is highly recommended.
I don't have an authentication server to try with, but I think your authentication will fly if you omit the certificate file part. However, you will possibly be prompted for a warning everytime you try to connect.
If you omit using the certificate (or, if you are using the certificate but you are connecting to a fake server), the connection may or may not work based on the supplicant type and version (in most modern supplicants it will issue a warning telling you that the supplicant thinks that this is a fake server and gives  you the choice if you'd like to proceed connecting to it.
