Try to make sure that all password changes happen between 'leaver isolated from network' (maybe an exit interview in a conference room, after work laptop has been returned) and 'leaver is left to own devices'. This drastically lessens the chance that the leaver would be snooping the new credentials (but with smartphones and such-like, it's still non-null).
