This is why you can't assign the same alternate domain name to two CloudFront distributions.  CloudFront -- like essentially all web servers -- uses the Host: header sent by the browser to understand what site the browser wants to see.  Web servers can't see the DNS path that got you to them.  The fact that you can do this while connecting to an IP address returned for a different site is no real surprise -- pick any CloudFront IP and forge a Host: header for a different site, and it is pretty likely to work, because there are good odds that the CloudFront equipment listening on that address can find the configuration within CloudFront and service the request.
The problem -- technically speaking -- is that you are actually wanting/expecting a response that would in fact be incorrect -- behavior that would be wrong if it actually worked the way you expected, based on the request being made.
You need a proxy server in EC2 in the target region in the EU to act as a target for the eu domain in DNS, rewrite the Host: header, and forward the modified request to CloudFront.
Take a look at the request headers using curl -v.  They may be connecting to an address retrieved by querying eu.example.com but check this request header:
