In terms of routing design, that would largely depend on the current setup. It's possible that both gateways lead to the same internet edge, in which case you may not have a problem. Asymmetric routing can be bad, mainly because you risk packets being delivered in the wrong order, but again, depends greatly on the topology you're talking about.
Protocols like HSRP (or VRRP if you have non-Cisco gear) allow you to have two (or more) routers (or L3 switches) on a subnet share a single IP address. You'll have your first router with an address of .2, the seond with an address of .3, and a "virtual IP address" of .1 that both routers are aware of through configuration. When the primary router fails, the secondary is able to detect this and take over the virtual IP address, meaning that your clients just need to have .1 configured as their gateway and you're good to go.
Lots of design principles implied in what I just said. I suggest you research both protocols, and determine what's best for your environment. If you're using Cisco gear, HSRP is a widely used and well understood method of solving this problem.
Actually, having two gateways can be a very good network design, because if a router were to fail, the other router can take over somewhat seamlessly. However, as you're aware, it's not easy to make this transition if you have to make a manual reconfiguration of each client on a subnet.
