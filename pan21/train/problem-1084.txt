Likewise, if your underlying web application is expecting a certain host name it may be generating an internal error when IIS hands it something it's not expecting (through the CGI variables or their equivalent depending on your underlying application framework).
If your application is bound to a specific IP or IP/hostname combination, then IIS may not know what to do with the request if a different domain name is being presented and you may need to add the new name to your configuration so it knows which web site it belongs to.
Are IIS and your application configured to accept requests on the hostname that you're using to access it?  A CNAME record is DNS-specific and won't have anything to do with IIS.  The DNS resolver takes whatever you enter into the browser and runs through the DNS resolution process (whether you're using an A record or a CNAME record) until it gets an authoritative IP address back.  It then connects to the server at that IP and presents the Host header to the server using the domain name that was entered into the browser.  IIS doesn't know or care that the name was a CNAME, only that it's getting a connection on a certain IP and a Host header for some name is being presented.
