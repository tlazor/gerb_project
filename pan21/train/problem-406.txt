There are 12V lipo batteries, but they arn't the same as 12V lead acid batteries, so would have a different charging circuit, and other changes. The design you want would be a combination  of something like the above and the one below.
My company have just designed a ups as you have described it. Our ups sits between the PSU and the motherboard and we have managed to drive an i7 CPU pc with 2 HDD's and monitor for 2 Hours. We have a USB connection to the pc that controls the ups and shows status etc. We can extend the ups up time in increments of 2hours in addition to the internal battery in the 5.25" ups.
Seems like a good idea, if you would use an external battery. Also most people will want to also connect other equipment like a switch, router, monitor. It is not (easily enough) possible to do this utilizing only DC-DC.
Laptops don't only use less power due to the conversion tho - you could easily build a PC with laptop parts - for example, there were MANY mini itx boxes with pentium M processors.
Now, if you COULD get a battery that small - you could possibly use a board like this or this which seems to be designed for low voltage systems. They're designed for car use, so you'd need some form of lead acid battery - too large for your use
Desktop PCs have less design compromises - they run hotter and faster both at the processor and peripherals. They have faster and larger hard drives. Its a little like saying that your little british three wheeler is better than a bugatti veyron cause it uses less fuel, and this is cause the bugatti has a excessively large fuel tank.
