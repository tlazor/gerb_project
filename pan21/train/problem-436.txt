So, it turns out, I guess this is a lesson on permissions. I'm guessing the problem had something to do with the 's' permission in /var/local/git, but from what I've read I cannot tell why that would be the cause of my problems.
before with no luck, but after restarting the computer, several other solutions failed because I didn't add the environment variable again. I was attempting to clone the git repository in /var/local/git. After a long time of not being able to do what I want, I started trying random solutions, and eventually tried cloning the git repository to /home/myusername/git. To my surprise, the repo started downloading! So, what was the difference?
Try removing VMware tools. I've had an issue in the past where no traffic (TCP or UDP) besides ICMP would flow. I TCPdumped on the firewall and router and saw the traffic going out, but the network driver provided by vmware tools was corrupting the packet in some way.
This doesn't directly answer the git question, but, you are able to surf the web (and download pages) just fine through your browser, right?  Possibly someone is disallowing certain user agents.  I would test by finding out what your browser's user agent string is and then supplying the --user-agent parameter to wget or curl.
