-Churn rates are familiar to anyone who has analyzed a subscription-based business like cable television or phones: the churn rate is the percentage of customers who will stop using the product in a given month
-The viral coefficient is in some ways the opposite of the churn rate: itâ€™s average organic growth rate in users in a given month. 
Implementation in Flash should be trivial. Either use the ExternalInterface to invoke JS from Flash, or use the tracking-classes provided by Google.
-Engagement: We are going to measure it by taking the amount of time the user plays each day (dough there are other things that can be taken in account such as the amount of features the user access)
If you don't mind providing your data to Google, then Google Analytics is a great tool for that too.
Using ExternalInterface has the advantage, that you decouple your game from the actual tracking implementation. So you basically just send messages from inside Flash to a JavaScript callback. There you would invoke the actual tracking, be it Google Analytics or any other tracking mechanism. That makes it easy to swap/modify/remove the tracking at some other time without recompiling the Game.
In my opinion the best is to store the information from the application in a mysql database (google analytics is too limited), and if you want to handle things really professional, then you should translate the mysql data to a vertica database and conect it with tableau which is an excelent tool that allows doing tons of analysis, graphs, anything you need for BI. Regarding what to measure, well there are mainly the following things:
The advantage of tracking directly from flash is that your tracking will also work if somebody hosts the Game on a different website, without the necessary JS wrapper code.
Rather than tracking classical page-visits (which you could use for different Game-screens), you can use the Event-Tracking feature to track/gather all sorts of data.
There is another measurement that I consider really important: How may minutes stay new players online? In the early days of Stendhal only 20% of players stayed online more than 5 minutes. We put a lot of work into the first few seconds of the new player experience and got it up to 50%. (Which I consider really good for a game people have not payed for).
So I guess both ways of tracking are valid options to consider. The easiest route would probably be Google Analytics in combination with the ActionScript tracking implementation provided by Google.
