When in comes to newcomers, I have found that Minecraft is more useful in bringing people into the world of computer based thinking. For instance, a lot of girls where I live are afraid and/or hesitant to get into programming. Many would find the concept of using their computers for anything other than watching a movie or checking email, extremely alien.
In such scenarios, Minecraft would help. If you were to check the Minecraft Education site, that is also what Microsoft is doing with the program. 
If you wish to introduce someone to programming though, I would say Minecraft is useful but not with the whole MineCraft + NetBeans + all that jazz route. If you are going to all that trouble of configuring that for a freshers batch, you might as well just setup the real developer environment which would be simpler. 
I am currently using Minecraft (especially Minecraft realms) to teach my developers (not starters but folks who have already covered some distance) how to work in team and also to improve their spatial and logical thinking. Also math, to some extent. So, first up, I am using Minecraft to teach, but not the basics of programming.
