However, if you installed Linux after formatting the drive, you have probably  damaged some data, but might still be able to recover some info ! 
I would say try their free version which works for 1 GB, and if it works it is fairly inexpensive (somewhere around $70 USD) to buy the full version.
I got bad news man ... but I'm pretty sure you just did a hard-format (not sure, I did not try it).You could go see a professional in HDD recovery but it'll cost you a lot. If the data was not this valuable or you don't have the money ... just format it back to NTFS and try, but As I said, you should try different program first ! 
If you did a full delete of your files and they really have a big value for you, I'd stop doing anything on that drive, go to a harddrive recovery lab near to yours, and... recover your data if its really valuable. I had that kind (without formatting the data or anything) of issue with a damaged hard drive and I was quite surpised of the output I got from the lab, compared to my 48h recovery software work on the disk...
if you only formatted  the drive  without writing any other data, your data should be fine. I don't think that formatting it back to NTFS will destroy your data but if you can find a program that can recover the data from RAW that would be the safest way to recover them.
