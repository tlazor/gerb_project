In theory you can mitigate this to a large extent with very very strict firewall rules, turning off any un-necessary services and keeping the system lean. Specifically turn off anything that allows remote access of any sort, remote logins etc. 
So... Yeah, its not just you. Basically any vulnerability found in XP stays open and MS isn't fixing it. Not all vulnerabilities rely on direct user stupidity. Any system visible over the internet is going to get poked, prodded and tested. NAT would obscure you, perhaps but the bad guys would know it too
It would be nice if you could find a linux style firewall that would drop anything outside specific IPs - then you could just drop any packets, anywhere, that arn't from the VM. 
"Security risks" here are kind of broad - the big issue here is XP isn't supported, and if there's some new threat targetting the many XP PCs still in the wild it won't get fixed.. As such, if I listed security issues specifically, it would be a growing list. Windows XP is a static target with dynamically growing threats
I'd consider a slightly different topology - I'd try a USB ethernet adaptor directly attached to the VM or better yet, splitting off the data collection system, doing a point to point Ethernet connection on its own subnet so the XP box is contactable but not on the internet. In short, keep the XP box on its own little network.
Of course, I've had an old XP PC exploited when it was the new, shiny awesome OS, and used by a skiddie to store warez so... its certainly possible quite a few years on.
