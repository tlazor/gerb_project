I could periodically rsync the files, or program a custom deployment script.  What other options am I missing?
What's the best practice for keeping httpd.conf and php.ini files consistent across multiple web servers behind a load balancer?
Our web nodes have an NFS cluster behind them.  We symlink the default config file locations for both Apache and PHP to the shared copies on the the NFS share.  A very simple shell script then does some basic housekeeping (rebuilding Apparmor rules, etc.) and then iterates over the web nodes triggering first an apache2ctl configtest and then apache2ctl graceful.
At the moment I have a script sitting on each web server that copies the configuration from a share and update's the configuration information to mach the local server (ip, etc).  While this worked fine for 3 servers, at 10 servers it's annoying (login to server, run script, logout, rinse, wash, repeat).  I'd suggest a solution (such a puppet and friends) that push the changes to server when you have completed your changes to the local file.
