Most likely, your VPN re-routes all of your traffic through the VPN, regardless of its local nature. You can correct this situation by adding a new routing rule that prevents local packets from being shipped overseas. Something like:
Added my local nameserver's IP and hostname in the /etc/hosts file and set the primary nameserver as VPN's NS.  And then the ldap authentication started working.  :)
I have configured cisco VPN client in a local machine in my network. When I start the vpn using vpnc, it is getting connected. But the problem is that, after that I'm not able to access my local sites because the VPN's nameserver got added. So, what I have did is added both VPN and my nameserver in the /etc/resolv.conf file and then started the VPN. But still its the issue exists. The OS I'm using is linux mint 13. Can anyone help in this??
I can do it if I add host entries in the /etc/hosts file, but that is not feasible for me as there are a lot of sites in my local network and adding entry for each is kind of hectic.
Here I am assuming your network is 192.168.0.0 and your router is 192.168.0.1; adjust the command to suite your needs. Notice that routing rules are applied irrespective of their order (unlike iptables), choosing the most restrictive first, to the least restrictive.
