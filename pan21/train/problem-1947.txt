I'm on Raspbian 8.0 (jessie). /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/wlan0/autoconf is 0, which seems to be related to the problem. However, trying to override this in /etc/sysctl.conf doesn't work, it remains 0 after a reboot and reconnect to Wi-Fi.
I don't know why in recent Raspbian images they changed that parameter to 0 when it was 1 for years.
I have connected the Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi normally (via the GUI), but it only has a single globally routable IPv6 address, with a valid lifetime of one week and a preferred lifetime of one day. I'm assuming this is a privacy extensions address and that I will get a new one tomorrow. However, all sources on the Internet seem to say that I should also have a "normal" autoconf address (MAC with ff:fe in the middle). How do I enable this?
I have a Raspberry Pi, connected via Wi-Fi to my router (managed by my ISP), and I want to access it from the Internet. This router includes a firewall, which I would preferably keep active, with just a hole for certain ports on my Raspberry Pi. Sadly, it doesn't support access over UPnP, so I need a fixed address on my Raspberry Pi to configure the firewall manually.
