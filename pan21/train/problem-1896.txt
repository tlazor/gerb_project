BIND is available for Win32 platforms, and it includes all of the usual query utilities, such as dig and host. You don't need to actually install the server, just unzip the distribution file somewhere and add the directory to your PATH.
nslookup should return exactly "what DNS is".  Your results may vary based on what server you point to or the type of query you do, but nslookup can only return what the DNS server offers.
Just be aware that the problems you are seeing may have nothing to do with nslookup itself. If you are not specifying the server to use it will use whatever DNS server your network config specifies. If that server returns incorrect information, perhaps because it is cached, then so will nslookup. Try pointing it to a different DNS server, preferably one outside your network, and see if you get the same results.
A somewhat heavier approach is to install Cygwin and then install the bind package available for it, which comes with all of the same utilities (though not the named server).
I use nslookup on Windows and dig on Linux.  I do mostly Windows admin, so whenever I have to use dig \, I have to refresh my memory of how it works.  I don't know what problems you've been having, but I've always found that nslookup with the right TYPE=whatever argument works fine.
