No. Absolute time error or drift is not an issue. Networking is very picky about the relative passage of time (event happen 3 seconds ago, this data is 2 hours old, this event happened before that event, etc.), but the absolute time is really only used for logging. As long as your router's clock is monotonically increasing at even vaguely the right rate, you don't need to worry about time problems.
If you are super paranoid about accurate time in your log files, you should look into Network Time Protocol (NTP) support on your router. You might also be interested in time smearing, which is particularly important for networking. I do not know if your router will take kindly to the time changing when doing NTP updates.
More likely you are just seeing issues with consumer grade equipment on a 100 day uptime. The software isn't superbly robust and lots of things can go wrong over time, such as the router accumulating massive logs files that are so huge they eat up all the CPU time to modify and/or a software bug (i.e. memory leak) has finally gotten out of hand.
