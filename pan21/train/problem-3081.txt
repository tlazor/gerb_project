Looking at your comment above , yes, you should be fine. I've done this with russian>eng before and it worked so I figure pt should be the same.
The license key will work just fine with Windows in any language. Unfortunately, for reasons that mystify me, they have decided that Language Interface Packs (LIPs), which used to make it fast and easy to switch the interface language, will now be a feature only of Ultimate and Enterprise editions. That said, you can still select whatever language you want at install time. The Portugese install disc provided my MSDN-AA should still have English as an option at install-time, if not you can use the license key with an English windows install disk separately with no problem, as long as it's the same edition of Windows. This page lists official sources of ISO downloads, including the English version (I have no qualms about linking to this list, because the downloads are of unmodified retail Windows discs and do not contain activation hacks/illegitimate oemact/etc., they are intended for use with a real Windows license).
