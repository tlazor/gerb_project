Applies drivers, changes the install from d:\to c:\ (by setting OSDPreservedDisk=FALSE, and Specify logical drive letter= C:)  then installs 15 applications(java, acrobat. etc)
As for the cause of your error, as you probably know if your msi doesn't return 0 (successful) or 3010 (restart required) then the task sequence will fail, unless
Then I installed windows 7 enterprise to a virtual machine, fully windows updated it, sysprepped and captured, It was installed to d:\Windows
Microsoft's recommendation is this: Import the install.wim file into sccm as an Operating System Installer, (not Operating System Image). Create a new task sequence to lay this installer down, update, install apps, etc, then sysprep and capture. For best results, let sccm sysprep and capture the image.
A thread being ran by your msi is returning a 32 which appears to cause the msi installer to return a 1603 back to sccm, which kills your ts. It is probably hardcoded to delete something from C:\Windows\Installer, or an environment variable is returning that path, either way I would redo it, because patching this could be like playing whackamole, with other problems cropping up in the future.
****NOTE!!!:** if I set 'OSDPreserveredDisk=TRUE' . the new image is installed to d:\ and all apps are added, so its in the process of placing it on the c:\ something is wrong**
I'm going to go out on a limb and say the real problem is trying to work around the wim being installed to the D: drive. This is because the install.wim from the DVD is being used for installation. 
Then, import the wim created from this task sequence as an Operating System Image, and use this for deployment. This wim should install to the C: with no hacks workarounds, and the error above should go away.
