The other IPs, as others have said, are good for hosting sites on a dedicated IP with SSL certificates. 
In addition to the comments above, if you are running your own DNS servers you need 2 IPs for 2 nameservers, you can not share an IP with them.
There is a little bit of a write up on the gentoo wiki. Unfortunately due to lack of support with IE on XP and lack of support in IIS, it isn't going to get anywhere fast.
SSL requires one IP per vhost with older browsers, so having multiple IP addresses allows you to host multiple HTTPs sites.
You can run a hypervisor and resell virtual machines with dedicated IPs, in addition to several other suggestions in this thread. 
SSL/TLA and virtual hosts always used to be a problem. Chicken and egg problem, resulting in a one to one relationship between IP address and virtual host. This has now 'gone away' thanks to SNI, although it's still generally unknown. SNI is in a TLA extensions rfc from 6 years ago, but still isn't in widespread use.
Multiple IPs could also make traffic control easier depending on how you segregate DNS names/services between them. You could make it easier to move a service to another machine, or apply a ratelimit/firewall to just one IP.
