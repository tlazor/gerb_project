If #2 does not correct the issue, and the problem continues then it is a problem with the driver or the printer. What model printer, and have you obtained the latest driver? Perhaps an older version of the driver (if you can find such a beast) is available?
This is a Driver issue.  Get the latest driver for your system and make sure you are using the correct protocol/port to connect to the printer.
Failing that - delete all of the drivers and ports related to the printer. (Right Click in Printers -> Server Properties -> Delete each driver for this printer, then all the ports) and reset the printer to factory defaults. Then reinstall using the latest driver from HP.
When you connect via USB, Windows will install a new copy of that printer. In other words, if there is in fact a setting that is causing this it shouldn't be present on the printer configuration.
May be because the printer (driver) or the program u r using is set for the wrong paper size. In UK we use A4 as standard but I'm unsure about US sizes (for example). It was a problem here too but largely fixed since A4 became standard AND programs (e.g. Word) recognised it!
If you are using postscript the following applies. In some cases printing elaborate postscript documents can also have this result when the printer needs more memory to properly render the document.
