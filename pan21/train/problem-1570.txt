It utilizes rsync behind the scenes, and is very flexible in terms of specifying file exclusions.  Priorities are also flexible, for example, if myfile.csv was altered in both directory A and B, so how should Unison handle this?  You can use newest, oldest, prefer directory A, prefer directory B, etc...
You can run it as a cron job to check and propagate any changes, or you can fire Unison "on-demand" using incrond  which allows you to run Unison only if a file change was detected.  I have not used the latter method, so I can't comment on it.  We have Unison run every minute via cron to check for changes in the two directories, and it works well for us.  It has a built-in lock mechanism so that it won't run another Unison process if one is currently running.
If you need to sync directories, and not just have a mirror copy of a directory, I recommend Unison, which we use in our environment.  It can keep two local directories synchronized OR a local and a remote directory synchronized.
