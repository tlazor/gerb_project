I thought that the 2ghz could have interference with other wifi networks around us, but 5ghz was alone.  No one else has a 5ghz network to interfere with us.
Netgear traditionally has a 4096 simultaneous session limit on their home-grade stuff.  With that many devices, you can max that out pretty easily I would think.  
I'm looking for either empirical steps to diagnose usage problems (including 3rd party software) or rule of thumb on how many users a router could support. I have looked for 3rd party firmware (DD-WRT, tomato, etc) that may give me more features to diagnose this on the router, but I haven't found anything.
Try the latest firmware from Netgear (V1.0.2.72), as there's unconfirmed (by me) reports that a later firmware bumps that limit to 65K sessions.  If that's not helping, look into buying a business-grade device instead.
I've thought about going and buying a switch to drop hard lines for some people as our office is wired for that, but I could just buy another wifi router to balance out the load.  I will say that the 2ghz endpoint experienced this problem a while back and I moved people that could to the 5ghz endpoint to balancing things out.  That worked until now and now 5g is crowded and we're seeing people getting booted.  
I have a netgear r6300 wifi router for our office, and we have 43 devices connected to it. We're experiencing some problems with the router kicking people off. I suspect we may have too many devices connected on it and we're running out of bandwidth, but I don't know how to properly diagnose that. I can see on the statistics page Tx on the 5ghz endpoint is 557,389 B/s. The 2.4 ghz endpoint is 507,481 B/s. But without any historical record it's hard to pinpoint when spikes have happened.  I don't have a NAS, but I do use dropbox and gdrive which large video files could be going into.  So bandwidth usage could spike more.
