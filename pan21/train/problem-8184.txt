Logging the login attempts are pretty simple. They show up in the security event log as the appropriate event with a logon type of 10. More here:
The information is there, as others have said, in the system event logs. If you need better reporting on your event logs, then you can do something with LogParser for free, or build something with Kiwi Syslog for free or low-cost.
Is there a simple utility to log terminal server use? I'd like to be able to do some simple monitoring of our terminal server and don't seem to be able to find any good way to do it. I'd want to track logins, session durations, disconnections, and failed login attempts. Ideally it'd just be something simple for a dashboard-style review to make sure everything's cool and there's no problems.
As far as the rest of the information, I know we ended up deploying Citrix and looking at Resource Manager and also using EdgeSight. Perhaps someone else knows a way to monitor exactly what you're looking for in a strictly terminal services environment, but I know we struggled with this until Citrix developed better reporting tools, so I'm not sure there is a terminal services option that is sufficient for what you're trying to do.
It'll have to be free (or very inexpensive) as this is just a lightly used terminal server with limited use. I'd have thought there'd be something built into Windows to track this, but if there is I can't find it.
Our solution to terminal server monitoring (any kind really) has been to configure each terminal server to send SNMP information to our ZenOSS Core server (Open Source/Free, support is not free though).  These are some of the types of information you can gather from these windows servers:
