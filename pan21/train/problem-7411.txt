Turning off visual effects can also make things a little peppier. Turning off Aero would be a start, but there are other effects like shadows under menus that you can find if you poke around in your settings.
Generally speaking, the best fix is to reformat & re-install Windows. From there, try to limit the amount of cruft generating activities - for example, installing and uninstalling large programs (like Visual Studio) or trial software, etc.
Assuming that you already have Anti-Virus software on it, I suggest using Advanced System Care, CCleaner and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware to clean things ups.
Depending on how you will be using it you can disable System Restore which chews on your resources sometimes. Same thing with indexing, although this can make searches very slow.
