You mentioned the aztech as being 192.168.2.1, and later as trying to reach it on 192.168.1.2. Was the first address a typo?
You disabled DHCP but did not change the default statically assigned address on the Aztech. You'll have to reset and configure the routers address before you disable DHCP.
For example if you changed it to, say, 192.168.1.2/32 (or 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.255) it would explain the problem: any request outside of its lan (ie anything else than from 192.168.1.2/32) would then be routed to the default gateway if there are no specific routes saying something more precise, and that default gateway is probably on another interface altogether (wan?)
I got two routers. A D-link DSL and an Aztech HW5503g. I connect to internet through dlink. The default ip address of dlink is 192.168.1.1 and that of aztech is 192.168.2.1. As I want the computers connected in in two router to use the same subnet, i configured as said in http://routersetup.blogspot.in/2007/08/connecting-two-routers-wired.html ie disabled DHCP in aztech and connected the two routers on the numbered ethernet port (not WAN). Everything works fine. I can access internet with any router. The problem is I cant access web interface of second router( Aztech 192.168.1.2) when i connected through either of the router. How can I access the web interface in second router in this setup?
