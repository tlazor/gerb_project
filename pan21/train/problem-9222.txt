If the disconnect is long and the log(s) had grown very large on the principal, the mirror will have to grow the log to a similar size when it re-connects. If there isn't sufficient disk space, mirroring will not resume (the ERRORLOG and system event log on the mirror will indicate this problem).
Data will be committed, otherwise the mirroring would be known as the 'high unavailability' feature. The log(s) on the principal will grow as it must hold all transactions that are no shipped over to the mirror. When eventually the mirror comes back up the principal will show PRINCIPAL/SYNCHRONIZING as the log will be shipped over to the mirror. The log(s) will start to free up as transactions are being shipped to the mirror. When the all the transactions were received by the mirror the principal will enter the state PRINCIPAL/SYNCHRONIZED. Depending on the mirroring type (synchronous/asynchronous) in this state the clients may wait for all every transaction to be shipped to the mirror when committing.
