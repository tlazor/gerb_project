Why does this make some apps look bad? I'm guessing they override GUI drawing api's and the OS scales the resolution for these apps instead of the DPI which makes them look stretched.
if you just up the resolution you get more screen real estate. However, if the display size stays the same everything gets a lot smaller. So, Apple put a display with a very large number of pixels and then turned down the dots per inch in the operating system to make everything take up more space, so in the end things seem the same size  
If PPI is increased, the app should look smaller. If it has to appear the same size as before then it needs to be suitably scaled. Now with vector graphics this is not a problem since these are resolution independent, but most apps employ a lot of bitmap/raster graphics resources which are resolution dependent. Scaling the latter can lead to varying amounts of blurriness depending on the image's properties, the amount to be scaled, the scaling algorithm employed and so on.
Images and icons look about the same because of integral scaling. But text in non-Retina apps looks clearly worse. The difference is that on a non-Retina display, text uses sub-pixel rendering. But with Retina, old apps use full-pixel anti-aliasing instead. (Those full pixels are then multiplied perfectly with integral scaling.)
