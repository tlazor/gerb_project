It's possible that my friend has caused damage to the chip from continuous experimental OC'ing, but whether or not that is true, if I cannot optimize the chip to run as fast as the 3570k, is it an obvious choice to bring back the faster clocked chip that is a less prestigious model, or will I be also be losing out on some feature I am unaware of on the newer, 'better' chip, that makes this decision more nuanced?
My generous friend recently left me his old PC which included an Intel 4670k. I recently began using software to OC my old PC's 3570k and was thrilled to learn that 5 years into it's life (without previously OC'ing) it could reach a 44x ratio and be stable without a voltage boost (extra volts on any ratio made if perform worse in benchmarks; 45x ratio wouldn't boot under reasonable voltage boosts, so I stopped there). I believe the default voltage on it was 1.024 or 1.04.
Upon receiving my friend's chip and PC, about 3 years old, I noticed that it becomes unstable and blue screens at his BIOS set ratios of 40-42 at a 1.072 voltage. Note that I am keeping the frequency at 100mhz as that worked best for me on the 3570k.
