This may or may not apply to the problem you're having, but it has solved problems with fuzzy areas on some systems when I changed out VGA/SVGA cables.
If a previous cable worked fine and the new one has issues, then the straight-forward and logical conclusion is that the problem is with the cable.
Cables that are DVI and better don't exhibit these problems because they're digital, and not analog.
Some VGA/SVGA cables have a slightly different frequency affinity than others, so when changing them out, I often will hit the "auto" button or menu option on the monitor to get it to re-scan the incoming signal and to pick up the best clock timing and sync for the resolution for that screen.
If hitting the monitor does not fix anything, it is likely the cable; if you have other monitors available to you, or other computers, you should try them in different combinations to see if you can narrow down the source of the problem. I've never actually encountered a vga cable that causes fuzziness; it's generally one of the devices. But if the cable is extremely low quality, I suppose it could.
The VGA port on your monitor may be damaged. To understand it, By this cable and computerØŒ and in this place,,,, use another monitor and check it. If the other monitor worked without problems, next You must take your monitor to the repairman To repair the VGA port.
When I come across an LCD monitor that's fuzzy, I generally give it a few good smacks (seriously) around the edges to see if that makes it better. If it does, even for a really short amount of time, it is usually possible to take apart the monitor and reseat some of the connections and give it another shot.
