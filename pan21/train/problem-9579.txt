The combination of these two in a RAID 0 will be as much as 80% faster than either drive alone, assuming that your controller is decent.  If you are using the controller on your motherboard, those are "Fake RAID" controllers, which is done completely in software, in spite of what your motherboard documentation might want you to believe.  You won't get the performance from a motherboard RAID setup that you would from a dedicated card.
6 gb/s is the theoretical burst speed, which you will never see sustained, so the difference between 6gb and 3gb isn't that important.  What's important is the actual sustained throughput of the drives in question.
A better configuration might be putting the Operating System on a smaller SSD drive, and using the drive you have for data, but again, that's probably not worth the trouble, unless you have some kind of ultra-high performance requirements.
You didn't mention what you are trying to accomplish, but for most people, the hassle and also risk of having RAID 0 isn't worth the performance benefit.  RAID 0 doubles your chance of data loss, since if one drive goes bad, you lose everything on both drives.
