3) Yes, that is a possibility using third party software, but it may decent size hassle to accomplish that the way you are looking for.  The simplest solution for what it sounds like you want to do, may be to utilize Network Attached Storage (NAS) and then configure your two domain controllers to actually be part of a Microsoft Cluster (which Server 2008 can do by default with the correct version).  In this type of scenario you can configure the NAS to be shared and the drive will "switch" to the active node.  You could also configure AD/DNS servers to "switch" to the active node, if there was a failover scenario.
2) Yes, if configured correctly the changes should all be mirrored, though this is usually not an instantaneous process, it can sometimes take several minutes (depending on your environment, size, network latency, etc) for the changes to replicate to additional AD/DNS servers.
1) No, they do not need a direct LAN connection. They can be configured to have AD/DNS sync across to each other as long as they are on the same network and configured for the same domain(s).
