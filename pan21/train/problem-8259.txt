Another solution you might be interested in is a personal cell site. They plug into your internet and broadcast cellular service for about the size of a house. If you are on TMobile, they are giving these things away! Other services have similar devices.
Mind you, I use one of those enterprise systems (a pretty darned affordable one, TBH) but that particular feature is one I do not use and don't have much interest in using, since it ends up with all APs on one channel and thus tends towards being an interference nightmare, rather than any sort of panacea.
Roaming between access points needs the two access points to be on two separate, non-overlapping Chanelâ€™s so a smooth hand off can take place.
If I were you I would try using an android app to map your wifi networks strength. You could walk through your house and see if there is a signal dead zone or some other anomaly where your signal is dropping. PErhaps the issue is interference from something like wireless phones or microwaves, not a handoff.
Non-obvious (to most people) answer the second is to turn your AP power down, so that switching is more clear-cut, but that may not help without a system that you claim you can't afford, since you'd still be switching APs mid-stream without system help. But "signal strength throughout the house seems very strong" is not as much of a good thing as you may assume - most folks turn things up too far and have more interference and input overload problems as a direct result. Many a system is improved by reducing AP power somewhat. Your phones and computers need to be able to talk back to the APs and they don't have particularly powerful transmitters...
VOIP is one of the few things that really freaks out when your connection drops for a few hundred milliseconds as you switch APs. If you don't switch APs IN THE MIDDLE OF A CALL it's not a problem. And that's the engineering solution, given your constraints.
