Having received the information regarding vulnerabilities, the Information Security Officer evaluates the vulnerability, determines the criticality of the vulnerability and it's impact on the business applications and environment. This information is then given to the appropriate Development Manager.
We have an Information Security department who are responsible to monitoring and detecting vulnerabilities. You could think of this team as being responsible to technical information security management. When vulnerabilities are detected using regular scan with tools such as Nessus or published US-CERT by the information security community, this team passes these vulnerabilities to each Information Security Officer within the group.
Since you reference the handling of vulnerabilities specifically in your question, I'll speak to this regarding how we handle this within our organization and group of companies.
The Information Security Officer, who is responsible and accountable for risk management, is tasked at a high level with:
Development Managers are responsible and accountable for supplier and vendor management. Business Applications are allocated by business domain to various Development Managers. The Development Managers work with either a vendor and/or their own Scrum team to resolve the vulnerabilities withing their domain. Should specialist advice be required, this is provided by the Information Security Officer.
