Are there any options for such a tunnel with basic authentication but otherwise unencrypted traffic for maximum performance?
Setting up an ordinary VPN would be easy enough, but I would like to avoid the overhead of encryption if possible. The purpose of this tunnel is not for any kind of privacy; it's just to give me more control over my ordinary internet traffic. I'm also not concerned about man in the middle or other attack vectors, for the same reasons.
The real question is why would you disable the encryption?  Its actually more work to disable the encryption versus using the OpenVPN defaults.  I would set it up in the default configuration, and only disable the encryption if you have actual data that points to the encryption causing performance or other issues.
I would like to set up a persistent tunnel between my home router and a remote server, which would allow me to maintain a static IP address and perform port-forwarding (my router is currently behind another, unmanaged router).
