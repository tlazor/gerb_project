I.e. on my laptop, I'd use Control Panel > Mouse, go to the Tapping tab, and there is a box for "Tap off when typing", and then a configurable delay if the box is checkmarked.
(You want paragraph 8) -- "8.To disable annoying behavior where the touchpad freezes up when youâ€™re typing: set the values of DisableWhenType_DelayTime_Gesture, DisableWhenType_DelayTime_Move, DisableWhenType_DelayTime_Tap all to 0."
Note: If the Control Panel is in Category View, under View by, click either Large icons or Small icons.
This is the setting to disable the touchpad-click when you type.  Depending on the driver installed for the touchpad, you might disable it in the touchpad properties.
For some people this option is apparently grayed out.  In that case the setting can be adjusted via a registry value.  Go to the below registry value:
Change the "To help prevent the cursor from accidentally moving while you type, turn off taps or change the delay before taps work" setting to "No Delay (always on)".
Another way to get at it is explained here:  http://wj32.org/wp/2012/12/19/asus-ux31e-setting-up-the-elantech-touchpad-driver-for-windows-8/
Nothing in the third party driver for ElanTech solved this issue.  I honestly think this was some new setting introduced in Windows 8.1 for touchpads.
