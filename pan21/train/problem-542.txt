-is there any way to move back emails from the PST file [6] to the current inbox/sent folders so that Exchange takes these emails into account (instead of deleting them)?
How did the server crash? Did your hard drives fail? How about the drives that kept the log files? The proper way to do a restore is to recover the server, recover the database, then replay the log files. If you don't have those log files to replay (or you're using circular logging, in which case you'd get something but not everything), then every change to the mailboxes since the backup will be lost. That includes inbox, sent items, calendar, contacts, everything.
-what happens to the Calendar items that were added after [1], is there any way to back those up as well if needed?
If you'd like to recover from the PSTs, you can do that in 2 ways. The first way is to just import them from Outlook. The second way is to use Exmerge on the server. Whichever way you choose, make sure to tell it not to import duplicates. This is a lot of work, but everything should turn out fine afterwards. On your next build, you can put your transaction logs on a different spindle of drives. Not only will this jump up your performances, but it'll also give you better hope with doing a "simple" restore.
