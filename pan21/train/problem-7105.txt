Notably if an $ORIGIN directive is not specified in a zone file then $ORIGIN is implicitly assumed (by BIND) to be the zone name specified in the named.conf file. From my observations it seems that BIND adds the trailing dot to $ORIGIN when it is assumed from the zone name.
My question is why do you specify a zone name without the trailing dot? Why isn't the zone name above specified as zone "example.com."? Isn't "example.com" a technically ambiguous identifier for the zone name?
When specifying the $ORIGIN directive in a DNS zone file if what you are specifying is a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) then by definition it should end in a trailing dot (for example $ORIGIN example.com. instead of $ORIGIN example.com). That makes sense since the trailing dot unambiguously indicates that the "com" or other top level domain is subdomain of the DNS root (which has a blank name or "" and is separated from the top level domain by the dot).
But in a BIND config file (in modern versions called named.conf), a zone name is labeled without the trailing dot like this:
