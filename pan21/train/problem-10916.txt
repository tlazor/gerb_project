So I can't use the disk management tool from microsoft? How do I create a partition with gdisk? Is it before or after shrinking the volume of HD?
First of all, can I just do it using the disk management tool from microsoft? I would Shrink the size of HD, to create a new partition. Then the idea was to install Debian in the new partition and merge the rest together. Is this easy to do?
It starts by telling me to use bootcamp on OS X. I don't have OS X anymore, I'm using windows 8.1 on my macbook. I have 2 partitions: Bootcamp (C) and HD (D). I want to install it in the second partition (HD), but only in a piece of it. Then, I want to put the rest of HD together with Bootcamp, to form a greater partition. 
I don't have OS X, so I don't have this 'dd', I think. Can I just use a normal program to create a bootable pen drive?
I want to use 28Gb from HD to Debian and merge the another 28Gb with Bootcamp to form a partition with 100Gb. 
I want to install Debian on my macbook air 13" from 2011. I'm following this tutorial: https://wiki.debian.org/MacBookAir4%2C2Testimonial
