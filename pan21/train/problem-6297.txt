Bombarding people with data via a single channel is counter-productive. Provide people with information and a choice about how they access it and they will be more involved, motivated and effective.
I have a large TV in my office plugged into an old PC that has my nagios status page always showing.  If I need to change anything on that computer I use Synergy to access the computer from my desktop.
We use hobbit as our monitoring tool, its non green page has almost everything we need. But its lacking a view of.our vmware enviroment and everyting regarding ou inhouse.software. So, I'm probably going to write something from scratch.
Synergy works for me, but what if one of the other admins want to change the screen?  Is there any easy way that any of us (currently 4 people) can change the screen from our desktops?  (Remote desktop doesn't work because it locks the console which is the output to the TVs.)
You could use VNC.  It can be configured to not lock the screen and to allow multiple simultaneous users.
In my office I have all our monitoring tools setup and working great, but I dont have an easy way to view them.  
Using something like Nagvis to create your own view of the system may save you a lot of time, money, effort, wallspace and electricity. For various reasons I ended writing my own front-end - it's not hard!
