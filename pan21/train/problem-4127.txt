I tried to think of a different approach, that the map border is a circle, and to show the round view is just needed to take the symmetric through the center of the map. However, the circular border shows a bad animation when the agents try to move through the border. 
And the flawless come when there are agents with the flocking or forming formation behavior that requires the agents to have connections with others. When an agent is moved out of it actual position, the other agents in the formation will lose their connection with the moved agent (Like the distance between them suddenly becomes large). I think that this could be somehow solved by storing the actual position of the agent and marking it as moved, but it may be too computational cost, or having too many cases. 
Currently, I am making a top down game using Unity. Here is the problem that Iâ€™m trying to solve: The player in my game is always centered on the screen, and the since the map is rounded, the agents controlled by AI must acts and be shown base on the distance of the round map. Here is the sketch for the better explanation.
(I don't have enough reputation attach image about the flocking behavior problem and the circular approach, so you have to imagine it)
If you can solve the problems that I mentioned above or have a different approach, please show me. Thank you.
