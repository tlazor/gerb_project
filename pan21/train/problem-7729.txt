If, according to the information in the gateway's routing tables, destination network is unreachable, (e.g., the distance to the network is infinity), the gateway may send a destination unreachable message to the internet source host of the datagram.  In addition, in some networks, the gateway may be able to determine if the internet destination host is unreachable. It is the Gateways in these networks that can send destination unreachable messages to the source host when the       destination host is unreachable, so it's not actually ICMP doing the determinations.
When you get a Reply From [IP address]: 'Destination Host Unreachable,' then the problem occurred at/after a remote router, whose address is indicated by the [IP address]. So it's a router telling you that there is a problem between it and the destination address.
Finally, if a datagram must be fragmented to be forwarded by a gateway yet the 'Do not Fragment' flag is on, the gateway will discard the datagram and will return a 'destination unreachable' message.
In the case that in the destination host, the IP module cannot deliver the      datagram  because the indicated protocol module or process port is not active, then the destination host may send a 'destination unreachable' message to the source host.
Now to difference between the 2 separate cases: Request Timed Out means that no Echo Reply messages were received within the set time. This can be due to many different causes: ARP request failure, network congestion, packet filtering, routing error, or a even silent discard.
But it does so with other network resources. Codes 0, 1, 4, and 5 may be received from a gateway. Codes 2 and 3 may be received from a host.
This indicates that you don't know a route to the desired destination, or a remote router reports that it has no route to the destination.
You cant ping if the computer isnt connected to the internet because by pinging you actually request the ip of the host .
