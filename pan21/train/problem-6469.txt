It was because I removed the mail box from Exchange server (2007) before I removed them from the groups is the DSA.MSC on one of the DC's.
Are they using auto-complete to select the recipients address? Have them try to type the email in manually. If this works correctly then I would delete their .n2k file under their profile. Sometimes the .n2k file can be corrupted and needs to be cleared out. Lets hope they are not using it for an address book.
Does this happen with all users or just one user? Does this happen when they are sending to a specific workmates or to all other workmates? More information on your troubleshooting steps would help narrow down an answer. I will however offer a solution since I have seen this error message before.
We encountered the same issue when we removed a few of our distribution groups from AD and re-created them with the same name/e-mail address so they would sync with Office 365.  Auto-complete was referencing the id associated with the old object and the user would receive a #550 5.1.1 RESOLVER.ADR.ExRecipNotFound; not found ## error .  Having the user type out the entire address once seemed to correct the issue and update the .n2k file. 
I have an end user who sometimes receives bounce-back emails when sending to a workmate. However the intended recipient does receive the original email.
If you have this for a user in a group re-add them to the groups, give them a mail box,  then remove from the groups and DISABLE (remove the mailbox/exchange properties from the user).  Not sure exactly how this would work if the user has already been deleted
