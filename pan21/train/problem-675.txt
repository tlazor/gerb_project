Strength bonus in your wep. will define the max hit that you be able to hit (more than with fists or worse weps.)
When you get crushed you add -10 to 30 and you get that your opponent will have +20 dmg exceeding your armor. And that way the average hits you get will be higher
The easiest way to cause this effect would be to give each shield type a % chance to block (possibly also influenced by other stats, depending on how you want the logic to function)
Easy way is to grab a value between 0 and 1 (many random value generators will give you this, if not divide by max possible value and you have it anyway), then compare with the appropriate percentage (10% is 0.1, 25% is 0.25, ...etc).  If the random value is greater than or equal to the shield value it's a hit, otherwise it was blocked
Say if a small shield blocks 10%, a medium shield blocks 25% and a large shield blocks 50%, like in Orin's comment.  At this point you just need to grab a random value and see if it's less than whatever your block value is.  
If you wish to add a character stat, terrain, direction, or anything else to this calculation, simply decide how it adds or subtracts to the block % and then do the comparison as normal.  Values less than or equal to 0 will never block and values greater than 1 will always block, though you can modify this behavior by setting limits on the value.
When you get slashed with that wep. you take the slash stats of the wep and you add +100 to -120 you will find out that you have 20 damage resistance from slash, then using your combat algorythms you can define that the average hit you get when slashed will be low because your armor is better than the attackers atk stats.
