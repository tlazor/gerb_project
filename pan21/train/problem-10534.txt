If you're running on DHCP (And if you've got 255 devices I sincerely hope you are) then changing the subnet mask should be simple enough, and then manually change the devices that are configured with static IPs.
what kind of problems am I going to run into by moving workstations into another subnet for accessing internal servers, web etc. do i need to set up a different windows domain and then enable trust ? any help and advice from those who have done this before would be appreciated.
I am managing what can only be described as the little network that grew. It began life with a linksys router, 3 windows machines and a dsl connection. Through the years, lots of servers, network printers, WAPS and the like have been added. if hiring continues at current pace, by the end of the year, we will have exhausted the complete 192.168.5.x with a single windows domain. 
The easiest thing to do would be to reduce the Subnet Mask, so that the devices can access 192.168.6.x or 192.168.4.x without having to resort to the default gateway.
That's not to say that if everything is running off cascading hubs and switches that you're not going to have other problems down the line (so perhaps this is an excuse to chuck in a proper router and have proper DMZ/private network segements)
