I turned back on the stuff I had turned off, like PEA/NX, 3d acceleration, etc. from the default.  Seems to work fine now that it has the correct OS.
I've tried the "root"/"toor" combo as suggested by other posts, but nothing seems to work. It looks like it's running, however. Never had this problem with other versions of Linux to date.
I just had this issue.  It turned out, after trying a bunch of other stuff, that it was caused by the OS being set to Ubuntu 32 bit instead of 64 bit.  
Open a terminal and edit the /etc/default/grub w/editor of your choice and change GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet" to "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="noreplace-paravirt"
The problem is that the laptop VirtualBox is installed does not have hardware virtualization as an option (a low end dual core intel B960 CPU) which explains a lot.  The solution is to tell Kali to not look for Xen at boot.
Kali Linux on Virtual Box - I think this is the same question. I just answered this guy too. I had the same problem. I had a black screen because kali was running, but I couldn't see it. So, click view at the top and select switch to scaled view. This should adjust the display so that kali recognizes it and shows you what you should be seeing.
Press "e" at the boot menu, scroll to the line that starts with "linux" and remove "quiet" and add "noreplace-paravirt" to the line, hit ctrl-x and let it finish booting (may take a couple of minutes), then login.
I had a black screen running Kali in Virtualbox just after installing it and installing all the updates and was able to fix it by  going into system settings in Virtualbox and just unchecking the Enable 3d acceleration box in the Display settings. 
Does anyone know the solution to the dreaded black screen on Kali Linux when booting from VirtualBox? I imported the ova appliance straight from Kali's website (Kali-Linux-2016.2-vbox-i686.ova) and, set the video memory to 128MB, switched the USB 2.0 to USB 1.0 as instructed (to get it to boot at all).
