A few places I frequent have unencrypted wifi. My understanding of this is that any packets sent between my laptop and the router are not encrypted, but how do applications factor into this?
Are those activities safe to perform over unencrypted wifi? I'm guessing each of those use their own form of encryption when communicating with their respective servers, but does that kick in before or after my unencrypted communication with the router?
That said, the risk profile of an unsecured wifi connection is probably quite different to what your pist seems to imply - specifically -
Sycing dropbox, emails and visited Sites is the Comms between your laptop and dropbox, same to email and ssl sites which are encrypted Comms. for example, dropbox uses secure protocols to transfer/ sync files for example sftp instead of ftp. It all depend on the initial handshake when key is shared which is used to encrypt end to end communication. if dropbox is using private/ public key pair (asymmetric), this handshake is secure (most probiders use protocols that provide asymmetric handshake). however using symmetric handshake, the risk is if someone gets the key then he/ she can see your data transferring between your laptop and dropbox/ email/ sites.
Your use of Dropbox and https sites should be fine as they are end-to-end encrypted. Email wil be fine (to the limited extent it is over an encrypted connection) if the protocols used are encrypted - so imap is not secure, impaps is, likewise smtp with ssl/ tls is OK, but unencrypted smtp is not great.
