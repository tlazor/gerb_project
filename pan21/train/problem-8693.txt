If your switch(es) do SNMP, then you'd also know where (on your network) it's flowing to. SNMP capable switches allow tracking the culprit (or legitimate user, if the company is doing things that eat bandwidth...) down to the port level without needing to do detailed analysis - if ports map directly to computers, you can then choose whether you want to talk to the person, or do detailed analysis from that point before talking to them. There are many complex and/or expensive SNMP reporting tools, but for a small office simple and free ones may be adequate, at least to get started. 
In an office building with 20-some employees, our internet service sometimes drops to about .3 Mbits/sec from 5 Mbits/sec. I use speedtest.net to test the speed. When the speed drops, how can I tell the source of the issue?  Namely, are my speedtest results affected by employee streaming/downloading/etc, as opposed to an ISP problem?  Would I need a virtually quiet network to accurately test speed?
If your router or switch has SNMP functions, it's useful to simply monitor traffic on the interfaces with a simple SNMP reporting tool running on your computer - then you will see the traffic that is going on. If you have a 5Mb connection and it's flowing at 5Mb, you might well have a hard time getting more than 0.3 in edgewise to speedtest - but you'd know that 5Mb was flowing somewhere, so it's not an ISP problem. If nothing is moving and you can only get 0.3Mb to speedtest, then you might have an ISP problem.
