"Windows cannot access \ComputerName check the spelling of the name, Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose."
I was able to access network PCs by entering \ComputerName in windows explorer. This was working before until I tried it again a while ago (not sure when it stopped working). The error message is:
On the computer you want to connect make sure that in Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings page that Network discovery and file/printer sharing is turned on for the profile its on (Its possible something in your network changed and now you're set to a public network). This will turn on the services and open the ports. The computer connecting to it doesn't need these enabled, it just needs to be able to see the computer. (Which is can, because you said you can ping it)
When I click Diagnose, it says it cannot identify the problem. But other PCs on the network can still access this computer.
