In any case, as you didn't say what brand and model the second router is, it's difficult to say what you exactly need to do (if one can derive that information from a googled manual at all).
Routers usually run some kind of embedded Linux. In both routers, you should have a bridge (say, br0) which contains both the wireless access point (say, wlan0) and the LAN interface to the four switch ports (say, eth0). You can then assign a static IP to br0 in both routers (say, 192.168.0.1 in the first router, and 192.168.0.2 in the second router), and run DHCP with some range of dynamic IPs (say, 192.168.0.100 to 192.168.0.200) that doesn't overlap with the static IPs. This will make both WLAN APs behave like a single LAN segment, so exactly what you want.
The next question is how to configure that on the router web GUI. It's not always clear what the GUI actions do internally (so "assigning the IP address .2 to the second router" may have done something else than you think it does), and it may or may not be possible to configure the second router in this way using the GUI alone. If it's not possible with the GUI, you'll need root access to the router, possibly by re-flashing the router with an open firmware (e.g. OpenWRT).
