Given that you plan to use the RPi as one sort of server already the easiest solution (if you are NOT using a wireless router, which can do this in a few browser clicks once you use a wired connection to it and can find it's IP-address in the first place), you could configure it to be a DHCP server as well - you will likely want to install the isc-dhcp-server package and dependencies on the RPi.
Now I use it all the time without internet--I switch my PC over to my PiWiFi access point and ssh to 192.168.42.1 and I'm good to go.
I got a wifi adapter for my pi when I got it.  Recently I went through the steps to turn it into a wireless access port (there are a few guides on this).
Technically a cross-over Cat-5 (or better) lead between the two ought to work but it may be a bit confusing for both you and some software if packets pass between the two and packet addresses are ignored but still get through.  You may find the Windows PC, in the absence of a DHCP server, adopting an automatic IPv4 address from the link-local 169.254.x.x range (they call it Automatic Private IP Addressing a.k.a. APIPA).  This takes extra time compared to using DHCP as it has to check quite hard that an address is free to use.
