If the player has an ethernet socket you could try find a wireless AP+switch that can play nicely in bridged mode with your main AP. I doubt it will be as fussy about what you plug into a ethernet port as is with the USB port. This will cost more than a generic USB wireless NIC, but perhaps less than the Sony brand wireless adaptor, and will be a larger device with its own wall-wart power supply so will be a lot less physically convenient.
There is probably little you can do in the USB side of things other than buy one of the relevant Sony products. This sort of irritation is one of the reasons why I refuse to buy equipment from certain manufacturers. You may be able to take it back as "not fit for intended purpose", though if the place you bought it from is savvy enough they might refuse an exchange based on the fact that it is wireless ready (as claimed) in the same way some games consoles have USB or SD card ports but will only accept certain specific devices rather than any theoretically compatible device.
