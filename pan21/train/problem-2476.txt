When I look at the hexdump I notice that it is just the same sequence of four bytes repeating over and over. That sequence of four bytes is not valid data, and trying to decode it will not yield any useful information.
If you see something like that again, I'd first try to capture the traffic using more than one brand of Ethernet adapter to be sure those corrupt frames are truly being sent on the wire, and is not just an artifact introduced on the machine doing the capture.
That repeating sequence covers both source and destination MAC address as well as the Ether type. This means neither source nor destination MAC address means anything, they have been corrupted. This is also not an LLC frame, it just happens that this sequence of bytes got decoded as LLC.
If you have established this traffic is really being sent on the wire, then you'll have to start looking for what device is producing it. This looks like a low level problem at the physical layer beneath the MAC layer. You won't have MAC addresses to go by, so the only option for finding the source may be to look at flashing link status, and unplug wires until you find the one producing those packets.
