Because you mention your IT department is lacking in time and staff to stage an environment for you, are you (or rather is your department/manager) able to bring any funding to the table? Procuring a small amount of annual funding would open up the possibility to look at the cloud.  Cloud providers offer everything you need, and some solutions even include the appropriate licenses which is often your largest cost as it relates to Oracle.  If you're not throwing sensitive data into this environment, the cloud becomes even more appealing.
Final note here, an AWS RDS instance is ONLY the database, so any app-server infrastructure you also need would have to be be accounted for in addition.  The cloud is a great option if you need a quick environment to test functionality out with, all while being a cost-effective approach; just make sure you keep on top of it and turn things off so you're not paying for idle servers.
There are all manner of cloud options available out there, but I'll point you toward Oracle RDS instances on AWS solely because they offer a License Included option, and you can turn it off when you're not using it to further minimize costs.  An equivalent may exist on other cloud providers, but many cloud providers I'm familiar with require you Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for Oracle-based solutions instead of offering an inclusive license.
I agree with @Marcin Gminiski's answer that you ideally want to have an environment that mimics functionality available in your production environment.  Although my 2 cents on the matter all come down to, "What can you afford?"  Budget constraints are often the killer of good process, so really what you can afford will determine the complexity/elegance of your final solution.
