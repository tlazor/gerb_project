There is no physical NIC involved in the bridge and the Bridge interface is setup with no ip/netmask/broadcast. Just brought up with a single "ifconfig brX up"
(Also, dear gods why do people think they need to set the broadcast addresss. Really, the OS can already calculate it from IP | ~netmask. It's almost never useful to configure the broadcast address manually, it just becomes easier to accidentally get it wrong.)
I am able to ping between the 2 clients when they are both connected to the openvpn server, each to its own tap interface mentioned above however I see no traffic when trying to tcpdump the bridge interface.
However, you haven't said anything about actually adding the tap interfaces as bridge ports. You need to explicitly tell the bridge which ports it manages:
I am trying to setup openvpn on a machine so that I have 2 different tap interfaces (tap0 and tap1) and then a bridge connecting those interfaces. The openvpn is setup with a server-bridge configuration for each TAP interface.
(Though, I guess that's not always true. The Untangle firewall, for example, seems to work in a cross-breed router/bridge mode, which is somewhat confusing.)
But it's possible that the bridge is still in "learning" mode; it still defaults to 30 seconds – check using brctl showstp br0. It's possible that the ports weren't added to the bridge (see above). It's possible that the port interfaces themselves are still down.
No, a pure bridge only works at Ethernet level – it doesn't even look at the IP header. When you assign an IP address to br0, you're really assigning it to the host OS, which is connected to that bridge.
