If it is C's own address then this typically means it does not have B in its ARP table and is not getting a reply to an ARP request.
I'm assuming that when you say they are on the same LAN, you mean that each machine is using a one and only one network card attached to the same switch, and that there are no routers between them.  I am also assuming they are on the same logical IP subnet.  If this is incorrect, please give more details in the question.  I have reason to believe that these assumptions are not 100% correct.
What may also be of help is to run a packet capture using e.g. tcpdump or wireshark to see what is actually occurring on the network when you run the ping. It may be even more useful to get 2 captures on B and C at the same time.
I have tried changing the network switch, changing the Ethernet, disabling firewalls and SELinux on all the machines and still the problem persists. I have also checked the IP address and the /etc/hosts file to ensure they are all consistent.
To confirm, check the output of "arp -a" (while the ping is running, or immediately after stopping the ping), does it show a line with the IP address of B and its MAC address, a line with B's IP and "incomplete" or no line with B's IP at all?
When you say "It says Destination Host Unreachable", what is the ip address of the device that reports this?
I have a small cluster running centos 7 composed of machines A, B and C. They are all separate physical machines connected on the same LAN.
It would help if you could provide your routing table for each machine, which is typically done with route -n on Linux.
