I run a small business where we currently have a single network running between WiFi and Ethernet over an AirPort Extreme.  Most devices are using WiFi with only my main machine running via LAN.  I am preparing a major upgrade to our network, installing new LAN lines and setting up a distribution room.  My end goal is to create two separated networks, one for the office and one for guests, that are both Ethernet- and WiFi-capable: I.e., network X will run both over Ethernet and WiFi, and network Y will run over separate Ethernet and WiFi.  I am putting together a hardware budget and have a couple of topology scenarios in mind, but I'm not sure if they will work.
Scenario 2: Internet comes into distro room, AirPort Extreme creates and manages two WiFi networks X and Y and Ethernet network X.  Networks X are linked. Ethernet runs to managed switch that creates a second Ethernet network Y that does not connect to WiFi network Y.
Scenario 1: Internet comes into distro room, AirPort Extreme creates and manages networks X and Y over both WiFi and Ethernet. Ethernet runs to dumb switch connecting all LAN jacks in building.
I have thought of other scenarios, but these two seem to be the most probable. The only problem with Scenario 2 is that I would like to provide printer access to networks Y, but I can't think of how to provide access the same printer if the two are separated.
