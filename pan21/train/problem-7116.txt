In a sense, you're right. BIOS and OS partly do the same things. The separation in BIOS and OS is solely for flexibility. 
If you wanted to make the OS do all the work you'd have to put the OS in a place where it can be accessed by the hardware without the preliminary help of a software (ROM). This may be possible for some closed systems, where flexibility is no concern. If you think about building hardware support into some other hardware, you're basically building a kind of BIOS again...
Once the operation system (or at least it's bootloader) ist found and started by the BIOS, the BIOS itself becomes largely obsolete. Modern OS use very little to nothing of the BIOS functionalitly after loading.
The BIOS is usually created by a hardware manufacturer. The hardware has to ensure, that a basic functionality is present, for example that a disk drive can be read from and that a basic display for diagnostics and errors is shown. Thus the name "Basic Input Output System". 
This can be done, to some extent, without further knowledge of the actual components really present on the specific system, since they all have to support a certain small BIOS standard. This enables vendors to custom-build a complete system. The BIOS just has to do enough to start the OS. There are some conventions to where this start-points are, so it just tries one after the other. This also enables the use of different operating systems on the same hardware. (there is flexibility, again)
So no, there is no technical reason, but many practical ones, especially for the flexible PC platform.
Another concern is memory size and cost. Full featured OSs are large and trying to get a multi-gigabyte OS into ROM is expensive, besides the follow-up problems of patching and updating it.
