create another one. Let's see: stop the array, remove all the disks (I'm not sure this step is necessary), zero out the superblocks to avoid any warning down the line, and create a RAID1 array. This should look like (obviously I'm not going to test this...):
As of version 3.1, mdadm actually supports quite complex level changing, as explained in Converting RAID5 to RAID6 and other shape changing in md/raid - so in this case:
I'm not sure I completely understand your issues here. If all the data has already been copied, you can just delete the RAID device, remove all the disks from the box you want to use elsewhere and re-create a new RAID 1 device with the remaining two disks. You can't shrink a 6 disk RAID 6 down to 2 disks without data loss anyway.
If you still want to copy some data to the new device, you could fail two disks from the old one and create a new RAID 1 from them. Since it's RAID 6 it will tolerate the loss of two disks (but you won't have the redundancy anymore). Then you can copy the data and remove the RAID 6 afterwards.
