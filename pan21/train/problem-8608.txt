By the way, Linux is great, but Samba is a real headache and even when configured correctly and working how it should it doesn't perform nearly as well as windows server does!  At the time, there were important features missing and I believe still are. So do yourself a favor and go with Windows Server. 
The system I put in place back then and maintained till around 5 years ago (apart from all the recent upgrades) is still in use today and the company is still operating.  At one point, it was all Linux, but mainly because we couldn't afford a windows server.
Don't upgrade the accounting system unless you really need to.  Don't fix what aint broke.  Is it meeting the company needs OK? or if not then consider an upgrade to something else.
Now it's Windows server with AD and internal DNS to provide resolution for local printers and so forth.  A router/firewall which is actually freebsd and doing mail scanning etc although you could get away with using pfsense or much less.
I did something similar to what you're saying over 10 years ago.  Although we started with 7 employees and grew to a peak of 30 odd. There was no IT system, so I put it together.
Organizing files is simply a matter of providing some management of shares and things and teaching people where to put things.  It can just be a manual process. Don't put them in a database, you'll regret doing that.  With a database, backup & restore becomes difficult. What if you lose a file and just want to restore a single record containing that file? in the mean time you have added other records.. now you need to merge to get the one file back yuck!
