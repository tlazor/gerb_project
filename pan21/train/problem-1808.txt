You have most of it. 3. is not quite correct as the EIP will still be associated with a stopped instance - it's only when you terminate the instance that the EIP will be released. You will also be charged a small fee for every hour an EIP is allocated but not assigned to an instance, so keep that in mind.
EIPs are designed for instances that don't live very long but yet you need a constant endpoint - such as computing database data and the like. This is because you can freely attach/detach them from instances in the same region (so, it can act as a failover).
We are evaluating to use Elastic IP on all of our ec2 instances, and we compare to the use of public EC2 hostname and Route53 (with a very short TTL to the public EC2 hostname & dynamic update DNS during instance boot).
Note that you will be charged Internet traffic if you use your public EC2 IP address (hostname resolves internally, so it'll work. Thanks ceejayoz) to connect between instances. Every instance has a private (10.x) address for inter-instance communication.
