P.S.S. Extension have sync with Google Drive, however I don't have actual version of data I need to restore, since it was not automated process plus to that in Google Drive I have not access to this files, as they hidden behind extension access functionality and I can only grant access to store data, but can't upload latest files by myself if they stored in same way or in other way it would be more complicated task.
I found still not deleted Database file with timestamp before I reload crashed addon and I copy files to save them, this is are:
However last 4 files already modified and few moments later 000008.ldb was created with small size of 200Kb, this is probably current opened tabs which override settings with only current opened tabs.
I tried to read manifest file, but it have a lot of binary stuff and probably unreadable, I also open DevTools on extension page and navigate in Application â†’ IndexedDB where I find a key to store this tabs in JSON format. Also trying to google for similar issues I found this article https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB where show examples of writing to DB from console, I also try to open it and have success with that:
P.S.S.S. Getting help from author isn't possible, author not replying to anyone in years (saw many posts about that).
I have failure when Chrome eat too much RAM and I get out or RAM, when that happen in Chrome crashed addon Tabs Outliner which I use to store and unload many tabs, writing notes, e.t.c. When that happen Chrome ask to restore addon and it seems like recover it by reloading, however it reset all settings and only current opened tabs are shown in it. I immediately go into settings folder where data saved as LevelDB/IndexedDB, the path is: C:\Users\__NAME__\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\IndexedDB\chrome-extension_eggkanocgddhmamlbiijnphhppkpkmkl_0.indexeddb.leveldb
