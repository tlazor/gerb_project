As Ramhound suggests, try/use the Acer-supplied video adapter drivers, as they may have tweaked the video adapter to a point where the generic Intel drivers don't work anymore. 
Having said that, you're current driver is SO close in versions that there won't be any difference in feature support even if you did get that newer one installed. 
When I download it and start the installation process, I get the following error message: "This operating system is not supported.". I am running on Win8.1 x64. So that shouldn't be the case.
I was trying to upgrade the driver using the IntelÂ® Driver Update Utility. http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect
So I think your Acer's external VGA port just doesn't support the resolution you want, which is not uncommon.
The native resolution of the Dell U2913WM is 2560 x 1080 but the highest resolution option for Dell U2913WM that I can select in Windows is 1920 x 1080. Therefore the screen looks stratched and a bit fuzzy.
