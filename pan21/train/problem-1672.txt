The relevant bit there is that the PSU was 5 years old.  Did it overheat the PSU?  Probably not.  Did the fact that a 5 year old PSU was running eventually cause it to fail?  Yes.  PSUs aren't built to run eternally, especially not in a consumer grade machine.
Various random things like humidity, too much dryness, stressful power drains, or unstopped surges can all make a PSU go "POP".
PSU's have an average smaller lifetime span then hard disks. And we all know how much hard disks like to blow up due to moving parts, etc.
Also... why not just buy a traditional fan?  That seems way overkill to run a PC (albeit in mostly shut off mode) just to power a fan.
Even in "legacy" mode... power should not be applied to USB when the PC is off.  That's probably some sort of bad design by the motherboard manufacturer and/or power-supply manufacturer.  More than likely... the power-supply failed (due to surge... cheap components... bad design... who knows)  and since the 5v line was still getting juice... that bit got fried.  Honestly... in my experience... if the PSU dies... and ends up cooking anything on the motherboard... I would throw the motherboard away & start from scratch.  I've never seen a motherboard not misbehave afterwards.  (random reboots/lock-ups/glitches etc...)
