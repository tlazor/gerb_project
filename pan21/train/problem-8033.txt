I do know that if you try to run VMWare within VMWare systems, it will complain and not let you do it. I am unsure about VirtualBox. I do know of a few people who, for whatever reason, deploy Docker containers within Docker containers (or so they say). Moral of the story is: while it may be possible, it's probably not smart to do it unless you really know what you're doing.
Nesting VMs is something that has been done for forever on IBM Mainframe hardware.  That hardware does lots of stuff to make the process very very efficient.  You can have VMs nested to an arbitrary depth and it works very well.
Performance is usually hit pretty heavily in this whole process on the "guest of the guest" machine. If you really must do this without the specialized hardware and software, good luck to you. However, it's generally not good practice especially with the common methods used to achieve virtualization.
Yes, you CAN but like so many things doesn't mean you should. I've seen a virtualized ESX server running a virtual machine that has another virtual ESX server within it. Granted it was a test just to see if it could be done (and it can) I really wouldn't recommend it.
I have been playing with virtual machines latley, and wondered if I could run a virtual machine inside a virtual machine?   Is it possible? Is it practical?
Needless to say, it's not supported and I'd expect it to be really flakey if you do anything even remotely weird (like Hyper-V under ESX).  And performance will not be good, regardless of if it is stable.
PC hardware very recently has kinda made this barely possible.  A document on VMware's web site discusses it, but the gist is that you can have VMs nested 2 deep, but only on very modern hardware that supports true hardware virtualization (VT-x or AMD-V), and the second VM depth must be running the older style BT/binary translation style virtualization.  There are also severe restrictions on the virtual monitors you're able to run on the inner guest.
