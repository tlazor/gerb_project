It's not the problem of the SVM, rather than your feature engineering steps. The thing is that in all tools (stemmers, lematizers, etc.) are optimized for English.
If you could generate quality features for your SVM then you would have better classification results.
I have used Support Vector Machines for classification of English Language Comments and it has worked fairly good for me in that scenario but when i try to do the same with comments other than English Language(Thai) it's results are not that accurate.Can anyone suggest what am i doing wrong here....???
Without knowing more about what exactly you're doing with your SVM and NLP, I would ask you if the features you're trying to use in your model can be readily extrapolated to another language such as Thai from something like English. I don't speak Thai, but it appears to be much different than English in a number of ways so it's possible that techniques like stemming might not be readily usable in the same way between the two models.
