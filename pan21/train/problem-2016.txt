We just had 5 24-port stackmaster managed switches go for $30...for all 5.  Also, I have seen fairly decent servers go for $75 bucks.
You may want to try Dell Outlet for newish servers or search the Google for "used servers" and "off lease" to find ~ 3 yr old servers.
Also, many of the larger outfits that maintain shops on ebay also deal direct.  You could try contacting some of them directly.
Most cities will have outfits that buy and sell secondhand computer equipment.  Search around your locale to see if you can find one.
Select a (region)state and (agency)city or organization close to you and be sure to check back frequently.  We only auction once per month, but some organizations auction more/less frequently.
This isn't a very well-known site, but my company auctions items here and, because of the limited exposure of the site, the buyer always gets great deals on everything from servers to cell phones to vehicles to tools.
I've had really good luck with purchasing Dell servers on Ebay.  Just look for resellers with high ratings and sales, read the listing very carefully, and review their return policy.  I've bought 15-20 servers, all in almost new condition, for 25-60% of Dell retail price. 
Most servers will use SCSI or SAS; servers with SATA disks are something of a niche item, so there may or may not be equipment of this sort available at a given point in time.  If you just want system disks then stick with the SCSI ones that come with the server.  If you need large volumes of SATA data storage you could possibly buy an external array.  Alternatively, you can get secondhand SCSI disk arrays such as a HP MSA30 quite cheaply.
