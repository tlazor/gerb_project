Could also be that your switch is overworked.  How many clients have you got on it at any given time, and what make/model switch is it?
Cheap routers can have their CPU overloaded by performing NAT across too many connections, generally caused by bittorrent. Unfortunately it's hard to detect, and depends on the specific model of router.
All but 1 of the problems you've described and all but 1 of the tests you've conducted appear to have the switch/router link in common (if I read and understood your post correctly). I know you've tried a different cable and switch port but have you looked at the configuration of the switch port and router port for that link? Check the speed and duplex setting on both ends and make sure they match.
For Wireless2's speed issues, is Wireless2 set up to act solely as an access point?  Double NAT can be a problem in this case: if everything under your gateway (Router) has a NAT address, and if your second wireless is creating its own private network (even worse: if it's attempting to do so in the same subnet as your primary network) you can get some nasty behavior.
Most probable cause is a duplex mismatch. 100 Mbit ethernet has a fault where occasionally one end will be running at full duplex while the other at at half. Check the lights on the switch and router for the duplex setting - both should be full. The characteristic symptom is the network seems to work well with only one computer attached for one way heavy data flow, but when using two-way heavy data flow or with multiple computers attached it falls apart. (Gigabit ethernet is much less prone to this fault due to improved duplex signaling). Solve it by forcing 100 Mbit & full duplex on both the router and switch ports connected to each other.
