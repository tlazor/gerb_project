My question is... how to set it all up? The "easy part", web page with all the functionality is not the issue, but I have no experience with setting up intranet web server to run in setting like this.
Provided you have the right firmware, IMO the best setup would be to utilize a DNS Forwarder that is basically a miniature name server for the LAN hosts. Open source router firmware like Pfsense or DD-WRT will have this feature. As an example, check out this link for general info on the Pfsense DNS Forwarder: http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/DNS_Forwarder .
This intranet web should be accessible from every computer within the network. I have access to the router closest to ISP modem and to the server PC, on which the web should be stored. This webpage should be accessible by name (let's say http://thishouse).
Also, it is not surprising that the hosts in each of you subnets are not visible to each other. Setting aside the technical details, I will say that a switch will likely be more appropriate instead of the bottom-most router in your diagram.
