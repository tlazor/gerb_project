This one is hard to figure out.  I think there's a sense that Support or Service Engineers have a higher level of technical skills than regular Sysadmins.  Historically sysadmins were considered more the people who keep the machine or machines running vs. the programmers who wrote code.
In practice I don't see a lot of difference between these job descriptions.  I think you might attract older or more senior candidates with the 'sysadmin' title but I'm really not sure.
Instead of worrying about this title, I suggest instead you read the SAGE job level descriptions.  Use those to determine the skill level required for the position.
Production support engineer sometimes means there is a separation of concerns.  The engineer may be consulted for escalations, but the admin staff actually execute any changes.  The support engineer may be a subject matter expert in one or a few areas.  The admin staff may support a wide variety of systems and have.more than one engineer for escalation, depending on the product.  For example, you may have a Windows server administrator, but separate engineers for Exchange, SQL, and IIS.  
Sounds to me like Production Support Engineer is an internal title given to someone who generically is a System Administrator, but just responsible for the production environment.  I would put System Administrator as the title on the job posting and explain the production environment responsibilities in the job description.
The engineer may recommend actions, but the administrator should have the final decision, because they are executing the change and are responsible for the outcome.
