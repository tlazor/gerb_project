Was just about to send the device back to dell, when found the answer.  If the unit is not master, even though it should be, you get a dead ">" command.  If you pull out all the HDMI interconnects, to make the box the master, you get the "console>" prompt, and can then enter commands.
I found the solution.  If you brick your device by not hitting "Y" in 60 seconds, then poke and hold down the reset orifice for about 30 seconds.  When it comes back up, you get a second chance to hit "Y" in 60 seconds and set the management IPs.  However, the console is still bricked, giveing a ">" prompt intead of a "console>" prompt.
When you first power on a 5524, connected via the serial console, you are offered a setup wizard where you can enter the management IP/Net/Gateway and enter the admin password.  HOWEVER, if you dont do this in 60 seconds, the wizard dissapears, and there seems to be no way to run it again - even if you reboot the box.
The CLI reference guide does not seem to have any way to run the wizard, or to set the management port or admin passwords.
