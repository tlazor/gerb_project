Does anyone have any ideas how I can redirect My Documents and other items in a user file to a second drive in the default profile so it affects each person logging in?
I have created a mostly set up default profile. I booted into audit mode, customized the Administrator account (mostly anyway) and then used sysprep with an unattend.xml file containing the copyprofile=true command. The file was set up with the WSIM and does not contain any extra info.
I'm fairly certain you can't manage the My Documents folder that way.  You'll need to either edit the local security policy/local group policy, build a script to re-map it, or use Group Policy for after the computer is set up and joined to the domain.
This could be related to the rearm count.  If it hit zero with this try, this could be unrelated to the default user.
I went to the user folder (generally has the User name) with all the other folders in it. I right clicked on My Documents, found the location tab and changed it to M:\Documents. Now if I run sysprep /generalize /oobe /reboot /unattend:unattend.xml it starts the generalise... then spits out a fatal error and goes no further.
In certain instances, where some networks don't have Active Directory to use Group Policy, using the local group policy should work.
This all works wonderfully. I recreated the WIM and all was good. I then decided to move the default location of the visible stuff in the user profile (Documents, Music, Pictures etc.) without changing the location of Appdata or other hidden folders. This is where things went a little... wrong.
I have been playing with Windows 7, WAIK, Server 2008 R2 and various other things. I managed to create a WIM with everything I need installed and I have worked out the autounattend.xml. I now have a Windows 7 64-bit complete unattended install from a USB device. It has all my programs, setting and everything done except one thing - the default profile set up 100% correctly.
