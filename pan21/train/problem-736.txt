So, this all means that there really is an infinite number of places to "draw stuff". Well, mot really infinite technically, but infinite in practice. And if you don't like one coordinate system you can configure your own and set the SpriteBatch to render to that.
A game world is just an abstraction used to make drawing stuff to the screen simpler (would you rather manage coordinates at (x,y) -> (160000000,160000000), or (x,y)->(1600, 1600)? The "world coordinate" is converted to screen coordinates and drawn on the screen via a series of mathematical operations involving a projection matrix. This matrix is used in a SpriteBatch (it's been a while since I have fiddled with libgdx, but I believe each SpriteBatch has a default projection matrix that maps the ratio of pixels per world coordinate to 1) to perform aforementioned mathematical operations. You can create custom projection matrices and set the sprite batch projection matrix for an almost infinite set of possibilities. The libgdx camera classes have projection matrices that you can use to set the batch matrix.
