Ultimately, the video card was bad.  This was true even though our IT team and Dell both said that the graphic card could not break in this manner.
Well I had the same issue and I got a second nv Quadro 450 and same issue was present then after about a couple minutes the system randomly detected the other monitors but it crashed the windows gui. After logging off and back on it appears to be working fine with 4 monitors. I'm using the supplied Display port to DVI adaptors. Had been running the original card for over a year with no issues. I am running a tyan s 4884 quad Opteron system with a 1200 watt PSU.the complete system is a audio recording console utilizing an RME PCI 9652 lightpipe audio card and the NV Quadro. So only using 1 of 2 pcie slots and 1 of 3 pcl slots. The mix desk automation, mouse/keyboard and the 88key midi controller are each on a separate USB port. There are 5  hard discs of 1tb each. All on the on board SATA controller and 64 gb of ram. This system replaced an otari 30 IPS 2" 24 track and a 24 track board in a heart beat and has been well more efficient and required allot less maintenance. I can record 24 tracks of audio and 64 tracks of midi in one pass. Screen real estate is my biggest asset. The old system was pretty much by ear and the automation was slow. I am going to see if now that one Quadro is working if I can repeat the steps with the second and get my projector and 48" flat screen running and see If I can start scoring films on this desk. 
Are you using DisplayPort to DVI converters?  They need to be active adapters, or you can't run more than two simultaneously.  This is true on 99% of hardware.
I think the key here is that even if I tried to use port #2 alone it still would not display.  Ports #2 and #3 were just dead no matter what I tried.  If #2 and #3 worked if I only used those two, then the other answer would have been best.
