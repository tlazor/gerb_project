One other thing to consider when using Windows Server Backup is that you cannot backup less than once a day, for example once every two days. By using the command line you can choose to do backup however less frequently you want! Remember that with backups to a share, you do not get incremental backups. The latest backup overwrites the past backup and consequently if your latest backup is stuffed, so is your only backup of the server.
This might all be advice that you've heard before. My 2c of experience as I've just finished setting up backup in my infrastructure with too-many-to-count W2K8R2 and W7Pro machines.
Have you tried using the CLI c:\windows\system32\wbadmin.exe? I backup to a share which I give to wbadmin.exe on the command line, with a username and password. I use Bacula as the scheduler, but you could create your own task in Task Scheduler.
The CLI version is also a lot more verbose, or so it seems as you get a chronology of status messages and path to two files at the end, one containing output (stdout in Unix) log and another error logs.
