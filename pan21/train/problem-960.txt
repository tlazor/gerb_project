Buffering of digital inputs/outputs by buffer ICs (e.g. the SN74HC244N) could offer a certain level of protection at reasonable cost. It however might limit your future design choices as the direction of the pin (input or output) will be fixed according to the wiring. Bidirectional voltage level translator (e.g. the TXS0108E) will overcome this limitation and needs no Direction-Control signal.
I think you might be worrying too much. I have incorrectly connected GPIO lines lots of times and so far I haven't damaged a Pi. But to avoid accidental connections I use female to female dupont cables on the pins I'm going to work with and then use a male-to-male connector to make the final connection to the protoboard. This makes it easier to connect and disconnect without shorting things by accident. 
Since all those solution do not offer galvanic isolation they can offer only limited protection. Things as mains level voltages or even relays driven without appropriate drivers and fly-back diodes might kill the buffer and the Pi too. However, "always" protection and being flexible in the use of the GPIO pins is most likely more expensive than the Pi itself (just as joan's comment suggested). The buffers will protect from thing that are somewhat likely to happen though: "minor" over-voltage (e.g. connecting to 5V) and ESD issues to a certain degree.
