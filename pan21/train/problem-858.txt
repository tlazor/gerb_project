All Quad Core Xeon 5xxx's are based on the Core or Nehalem architecture so in your case your CPU's do not support Hyperthreading.
I've only read about this topic a handful of times. I found an article at www.vmguy.com here that sums up the consensus on this HT issue (direct from the article):
Again, this is directly from the article. I'm not certain that HT is worth it as I too use AMD Opterons so I can't speak from experience.
I have (as some are probably tired of seeing on SF) a Dell 2950, dual 4 core 3Ghz processors running ESXi. I noticed on the VSphere management console that the server says it doesn't have hyperthreading enabled ("inactive")
Are you sure your CPUs even have HyperThreading on them?  I think most quad core CPUs don't.  My ESX Servers also report that HyperThreading is "inactive" and I've got AMD CPUs which have never had HT on them.
The only Intel CPU's that support Hyperthreading are the Netburst (Pre Core\Core Duo) architecture and the most recent Nehalem based CPU's (ie for servers only the Xeon 5500's at this point in time). The 2950 range does not support the Xeon 5500 but it does support the earlier 5000, 5100,5200, 5300 & 5400 ranges (the precise CPU's supported varies a bit between the various 2950 models). Of those only the oldest, the 5000 series (Dempsey), supports Hyperthreading as it was based on the Netburst architecture. 
I know I could shut down all the VM's and reboot and edit that setting, but should I? Is there a real benefit to having hyperthreading enabled on this type of setup, or is the performance gain marginal, if any??
