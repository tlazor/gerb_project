inetres.admx was updated for Internet Explorer 11 (presumably for every other previous version of IE as well).  What version of IE is running on the Windows 7 workstation?
The problem affects all Windows versions, which are using a language setting different than en-US, as soon as KB3093983 is installed.
The problem is that KB3093983 installs an updated inetres.admx file and only includes and installs the corresponding en-US inetres.adml updated language file. Leaving inetres.admx and inetres.adml mismatched for any other language.
You did not speficy what language you're seeing this with, but I can confirm that at least the en-US version of the latest release (August 2014) contains a string with identifier VerMgmtAuditModeEnable
The culprit is KB3093983 Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer versions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, released on October 12, 2015.
The top few lines of the ADMX XML document specify the minRequiredRevision="11.0"  I suggest you check and see if your language file matches the ADMX in this regard.
Go to Microsoft's Download Center and download the latest release of the Administrative Templates for Internet Explorer. 
Certainly sounds like somebody updated the Administrative Template without updating the corresponding language file.
If you have deployed an update to Internet Explorer updates as part of your integration work, did you use the IEAK and did you specify any particular locales?
