Just like thims said you could try office 365 exchange online. And pst is microsoft propriety so gmail and other webmail services wont open them.But if you make a .dbx or a .wab file from outlook express you can uplocad it to live mail to go through it .
You will be able to search and a great deal more. Hotmail have Outlook-style inteface, folders, calendars and contacts. Give it a try, you will not be dissapointed!
Is there a way to backup my old e-mails to the cloud while still being able to search and view them online.
I highly recommend you create a Windows Live Hotmail, connect it to your Outlook. This way you will be able to simply drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste your Outlook items into this account. Outlook automatically synchronizes all folders using Outlook Hotmail Connector (Outlook 2010 will install it automatically after your add the account).
If you are always going to have access to outlook you can always put your .pst files on cloud data servers like dropbox an just point your outlook to the .dropbox folder with pst in it.
