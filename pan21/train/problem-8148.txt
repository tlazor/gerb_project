Note: change $v[8]=3 to $v[8]=2 in the commands above to undo this change (if you want the taskbar to be always visible).
Normally from cmd, it's enough to use a reg add command to modify the registry, but we use powershell because it makes it easy to preserve the other settings stored under the same registry key.
Yes you can download this great tool called " Hide Taskbar" , which gives you a shortcut " Ctrl+Esc" (by default, you can change it) to hide/unhide the taskbar 
powershell -command "&{$p='HKCU:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StuckRects2';$v=(Get-ItemProperty -Path $p).Settings;$v[8]=3;&Set-ItemProperty -Path $p -Name Settings -Value $v;&Stop-Process -f -ProcessName explorer}"
powershell -command "&{$p='HKCU:SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StuckRects3';$v=(Get-ItemProperty -Path $p).Settings;$v[8]=3;&Set-ItemProperty -Path $p -Name Settings -Value $v;&Stop-Process -f -ProcessName explorer}"
Try this little program that I found a while ago. 'Tis amazing. It toggles the taskbar shown or hidden with Alt-T, and you can set it to start up with windows as well.
Explorer also needs to be restarted to pick up the change. We use Stop-Process because Windows automatically restarts Explorer when it is stopped.
This taskbar hiding application lets me choose the hotkey to hide the taskbar. I mapped the AutoHotKey-hotkey to Win+A and the TaskBar Hider to Win+Y. So now when I press Win+Y, Win+A the taskbar toggles without popping up again when I accidentally the bottom pixel; when I press Win+Y, Win+A again it comes back and stays there no matter where I put the mouse cursor and it's just great. A one-key solution would be even better though with the two hotkeys so close together it's really manageable.
The registry key which stores this value also stores a number of other settings. Since we only want to change position 9 ($v[8] in the cmd) of that registry setting, we need to preserve the other settings.
