Put in a room, like a bathroom, lay it on a flat surface, crank the heat as to raise the temperature in the room to evaporate the water without actually heating the machine, leave it in there for 24 hours, make sure you remove the battery, after 24 hours, put in the battery and attempt to turn it on, if it does, congrats you saved it, if not, take it to your local repair shop.
Please tell me what can I do? I have never dis-assembled laptop. As a last option, I will go to service center.  
When water gets into an electronic device, electricity moves in unusual ways. You may have fried your computer. If you are lucky, drying it out THOROUGHLY may save it. Ultimately, you can't rush this process. It will probably be best to let it dry for at least a day. Good luck.
I had my laptop (dell inspiron) and water bottle in my bag, and small quantity of water leaked into my laptop. When Iopened my laptop, the power light came and went immediately. So I removed the battery, and saw a.water drop on case. Laptop felt wet. I dried whatever I could (outside only). After an hour I put back battery, and saw hard disk activity light came on. And then I pushed power button, power light came on and went off again.
An hour isn't enough for water droplets to dry up.  I'd remove the battery and keep the laptop open in a dry place for a day or two and try again.  The power supply or motherboard may already be damaged beyond repair, but I wouldn't try to turn it on again until you can be sure it's dry inside.  It's fairly likely the hard drive is intact, so recovering your files might be possible, but don't try removing it until you know the laptop isn't working.
