You also need to avoid the older screw design that has a washer molded into the screw head, as this makes the screw head diameter too large and it scrapes against surrounding components like the micro USB connector, while being screwed in.  Newer screw designs (~mid 2000s) seem less likely to have this shape so aren't a problem.
What is the size of these screws? That is, if you are walking down the isle of a hardware store, what numbers should you be looking for?
Here's a photo of a Pi mounted with floppy drive screws into motherboard stand-offs, which are themselves screwed into a plastic case (after drilling 2.5mm holes into the plastic to ensure a tight fit for the standoffs).
Just to add to the already correct answers, there's enough leeway to enlarge the PCB holes to M3 size so that you can use standard PC floppy drive screws, of which any PC enthusiast is likely to have a surplus.  These often fit into the brass motherboard stand-offs that come with PC cases (and are readily available online) so it makes for a cheap and easy way to securely mount the Pi.
On the model B+ there are four screws that can be used to attach your device either to a base or firmly inside of a case or other enclosure.
I've just had a look at the Raspberry Pi A/B/A+/B+/2 PCB mounting holes and they all seem to be a little over 2.5mm diameter so a M2.5 machine screw/bolt would be the best fit. I usually use Nylon M2.5 bolts, washers, spacers and nuts when mounting boards to the Raspberry Pi.
Just remember to use a drill to enlarge the holes, as forcing an M3 screw through the original sized hole makes cracking sounds and so you risk snapping the PCB that way.
