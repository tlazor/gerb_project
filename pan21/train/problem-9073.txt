NOTE: Ambient occlusion component is also used by other phenomena so it can also simulate dirt packing etc. In any case your NOT supposed to multiply ambient occlusion by everything. Quite many tutorials make this mistake. You should add the ambient occlusion to existing image, that is if you only estimate ambient light with it.
Image 2: By modulating the ambient light with local geometric occlusion we get a much nicer and realistic contribution of ambient light. Final color and contribution also tweaked slightly (right). Just plain ambient (left).
Ambient light does not really exist, if we do not talk about cosmology. What we call ambient is just light form many secondary reflections.
We can approximate ambient light by a constant factor. But this looks slightly washed out as ambient light is not constant over the scene. To make the ambient look better we can use a trick. If we make a hemispherical probe for object coverage (occlusion), we get an estimate of how much the pixel lies inside a cavity. The less you live in cavity the more likely the ambient light is going to hit here.
