I would appreciate any help/suggestions for resolving this issue or sharing of similar stories, etc. I would like to return home with a list of ideas to go through because right now I'm so scared to cause a new problem or misdiagnose the issue, etc that I'm tempted to just take it to GeekSquad even though I think I could probably do a better job still.
It worked fine for about 5 minutes on first power and I noticed things were kind of slow and just other signs of poor performance so I went for a reboot. Upon reboot and every time thereafter, I barely make it to the BIOS menu and then it shuts off. However, I was able to keep it powered on long enough to get a picture of the settings that I think will help diagnose the culprit:
I bought a computer probably about a year and a half ago now and due to some unforeseen extensions in military training, I have been away from home for about 9 months. Well I came back home to visit recently and discovered the computer wasn't working:
Notice the CPU Temperature - this is WAY hotter than I would expect the Desktop to be (hell, that's hotter than my laptop most of the time). Since I'm pretty sure the cause has to do with lack of use, the main component I thought of that would be affected by this was the liquid cooler. Somehow or for whatever reason, I think the coolant has stagnated and is not recirculating or something causing that severe temperature and I anticipate that some temperature sensor in the M/B is then triggering the shutdown since I read that if a CPU has sustained enough damage from heat to shut down, it is unlikely you would be able to power the computer back on at all.
Luckily, the liquid cooler was only about $80 but its directly thermal-pasted to the CPU so if I have to remove it I'm not sure what precautions I should take or if this is even possible?
