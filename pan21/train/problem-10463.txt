IE is the only browser to be provided access to the Desktop on Windows RT, and most probably as long as MS doesn't attain a monopoly in the market with WOA (Windows on ARM), this state of affairs will continue.
Neither is available as MS won't allow third-party apps full access to the system. This blog post from Mozilla outlines their objections to this policy.
The main reason that there are no other browsers is that other browser companies would have to recreate both their browser's UI and their browser's engine, since they are not given permission to access the desktop, and also since C++ isn't compatible with WinRT. I personally find it really ironic that their less-powerful and less-popular Windows Phone 8 is compatible with the more advanced C++, however WinRT isn't.
At this point it is unclear whether WinRT APIs solely without access to Desktop mode can enable creation of any other browser for WOA. Interestingly I did find UC BrowserHD that can run on ARM and thus WinRT, but I don't know whether it's just a "skin" for the IE Trident engine (couldn't find details on its site). I'll look into it further and perhaps try it myself, but if it's truly an independent browser for WinRT then that's quite an achievement and most likely the first of its kind.
