In Windows, I use "Software Information for Windows", and I have found that occasionally, it can be wrong. My current laptop is specified as having a maximum memory capacity of 2048MB, and a maximum module size of 2048MB for each of two slots. The reality is that the max per slot is correct, and I am safely running 4GB.
It might be showing that the chipset supports more slots, even if the motherboard is not wired up to have those slots. It is more common these days for the chipset to know the other sots are not present (rather than just empty) but this is not always the case.
If the slot that you found was empty then there must be another one somewhere, either that or your existing memory is soldered directly onto the board (the chipset won;t see any difference: it doesn't care whether the RAM chips and relevant circuitry are associated with a DIMM slot or if they are all directly connected to the board).
This information is probably being gathered from the same place regardless of OS (in other words, that I use Windows and you don't is only relevant to how we access this info from the Motherboard), and it clearly can be wrong.
With laptops you often find that there are two slots, one on either side of the motherboard. In these cases one is usually easily accessible via the under-side of the case (under a cover held in place by one or two screws) and the other is on the other side of that and difficult to get to (you end up having to take the laptop completely apart if you want to get to it, and even then you might fins it isn't a real "slot" but some memory chips soldered direct to the board).
