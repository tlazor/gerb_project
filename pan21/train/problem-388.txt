After that, they could login, but a new issue started.  (I mention the previous stuff in case there is a clue in there.)  Now a roaming-profile user can't do things that make lasting changes.  For example, they DO get their documents but they CAN'T print, set a default printer, or disable the Google or MSN toolbars in Internet Explorer.
Users with Roaming Profiles on my XP workstations appear to be unable to do various things, e.g. set a default printer, disable toolbars in IE8, or see icons on the left side of the Start menu.  Local accounts still work as expected.
In order to fix this, I moved a workstation from the domain to the workgroup "WORKGROUP", restarted, and move it back.
A few weeks later, I found out that the XP workstations were having issues with the roaming profiles.  Users would get an error at login (effectively, "I can't copy your profile from the server, so I'm using the local copy.") and then see their desktop.  They thought that they were OK, so they didn't report the problem at first.  However, it wasn't copying their profiles to the server.
I have a Mac OS X Server (10.6.4) Open Directory server that acts as a PDC for a few Windows XP workstations.  Recently, I upgraded it (10.5 --> 10.6) and another Mac server that is the BDC and OD Replica.
