I think to remember some - supposedly breaking - change of the kernel interface with respect to the size of time_t or so. Are there any such changes that would break old binaries relying on the old syscall or would that merely affect newly built/linked binaries which are tied to the (corresponding) new syscall?
We have very old FreeBSD build systems (6.3) which we use to maintain backwards compatibility with the system libraries for our proprietary binaries and avoid building on each and every FreeBSD version.
I think bhyve is your first resort, not your last.  If you jail your build environment, then you're testing your product against a 6.3 world and libraries, with an 11.x kernel.  Your customers however, will be running a 6.3 world/libs and a 6.3 kernel.
Differences between the 6.3 and 11.x kernels can be expected to increase over time, I would imagine.  This could conceivably lead to situations such as one in which your test jail's 11.x kernel Does The Right Thing, but your customer's 6.3 kernel doesn't, and therefore, you can't reproduce your customer's problem report.
Question: Is it technically possible to install a fresh FreeBSD 11.x and jail the old system on it? Or will there be issues due to incompatible system calls?
