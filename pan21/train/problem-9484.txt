I suggest replacing the processor as well if you replace the motherboard ;). Otherwise you should be able to just do a repair on the install and keep all the data, no guarantees though I have had fail and work... You might also want to make sure the power supply is adequate for the new processor and as Bloodphilia mentions the hard drive uses the same connector (IDE, SATA).
You can expect all kinds of errors if you just repaalce the motherboard. Also, windows may require reactivation after that.
The only problem I've faced when swapping hard drives between different computers (which is basically what you're doing; forcing the OS to run with completely different hardware) was looking for chipset drivers (or motherboard drivers).
Another thing that might happen is that Windows XP requires a re-activation after the swap. This shouldn't be a problem if you're using a genuine Windows version.
These drivers are used by the OS to allow you to use the motherboard's built-in hardware, like the ethernet port, etc. Not all mobo swaps, however, will cause this to happen, but it might.
It all depends on which motherboard you're using and which you're replacing it with. There are two main issues when swapping everything around your harddrive:
