So, I need to return my Pi to runlevel 3 (multi-user.target) without being able to run commands on my Pi (so I can't use the usual systemctl or raspi-config approaches). This question suggests this could be done in older versions of Raspbian by editing /etc/inittab but this no longer exists with the switch to systemd.
On my latest run, in trying to set a graphical mode that I can program on (in Java), I set the Pi to auto-login to desktop via raspi-config. Upon boot now, the screen is black and the Pi is not connecting to the network (whereas it did previously in command line mode).
I looked through /var/log/messages and see IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): wlan0: link becomes ready yet no connection is made. I have the correct settings configured in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and do not have /etc/network/interfaces configured, which other answers seem to point to for fixing connectivity.
I am setting up a RPi Zero W with Adafruit's 3.5" PiTFT touchscreen and my only input to the Pi is either through ssh or by editing files from another system running Ubuntu.
