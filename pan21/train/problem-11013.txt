Are you running the latest firmware?  Unless you have legal / compliance issues, or you test it and find it breaks something, you really should use the latest firmware...
Not really a solution, but we recently implemented a new Exchange 2010 mail server and we have not seen any of these problems with Exchange 2010.
I've seen the same thing, with it usually resulting in a message perpetually stuck on the device, with a reboot not helping. All other mail was flowing properly, it was just that one message, so EAS appeared to be working properly. In my case, I had to remove the account from my iPhone, and add it back in again. I'm using a 3G with 4.0.1
As with any troubleshooting, you should also make sure you are up to date on the iPhone as well, 3.x is getting rather old, and you should seriously think about updating.
Offhand this sounds like a problem with the EAS client on the iPhone. I have found that occasionally the iPhone mail app will get stuck and requires a reboot of the device before it will resume its normal sync behavior.
Something to try: Send yourself an email, watch both the phone and Outlook. Once you see it in Outlook, delete it immediately. Check on the phone. I think that I may have had an instance where I deleted it in Outlook, while it was mid-download to the phone, and it got a partial copy. Since it couldn't get it from the server any longer, it was stuck in the "this message was not downloaded from the server" state.
