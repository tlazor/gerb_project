This particular mail server is a CentOS 4.4.7 64-bit. The little configuring we had to do after restarting it was to configure the network connection as it was resolving through DHCP. Our mail software is Lotus Notes server 9.
Recently, we had to replace the motherboard of one of our servers. The procedure was done by IBM as it had guarantee. The server runs ESXi 5.1, with several virtual machines, including our main mail server (Domino) and a file server.
There was a moment this morning in which I tried connecting via SSH console and it was really slow to show login and basic commands like ifconfig and top.
After the replacing the motherboard and staring the VMs, ESXi asked us if we had moved it or copied (different motherboard is like a different computer). We clicked the latter. We started each machine and after some basic reconfiguration, all of them were up. However, we have been having problems with the mail server, it has been acting really slow at times (this could be when it syncs with the secondary mail server) and we have been checking with Centreon (a Nagios frontend) that its CPU load has been a bit high at times and ping response too.
Do you know of any way in which this replacement may be causing these difficulties, and how to fix it?
