Try entering the formula ="" (that's two double quotes) in the adjacent cell where you don't want to see the overflow. This evaluates to "null" which displays nothing and won't affect math.
In the same line of thinking that Google Sheets may not be for everyone, this macro may not be for everyone but it may be for someone.
Final note:  I have used it for personal projects and found it reliable but please save and back up your work before trying any unfamiliar macro.
In Excel, adjust the column to the required width, then enable word-warp on that column (which will cause all row heights to increase) and then finally select all rows and adjust row heights to the desired height. Voila! You now have text in cells that do not overflow to the adjacent cells.
This may not be an option for everyone, but if you import the document into Google Sheets, this functionality is supported by default. On the top menu bar, three types of text wrapping are supported. Overflow, wrap, and clip. You are looking for clip.
