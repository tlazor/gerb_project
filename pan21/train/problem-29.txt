I am not sure and I cannot verify this, as I have no polish keyboard, but you have a good chance by switching your user settings to use '.' as the numeric separator, in Control Panel/Region and Language (or so). There are 'Customize' options to specify your 1000 separator, your decimal separator, etc.
I'm using Windows 10 with polish keyboard layout. Right now, dot key on my numpad inserts ',' instead of '.'. I'd like to change it preserving polish keyboard layout and without installing 3rd party apps. I've seen, that for some people changing decimal separator in regional options from ',' to '.' helped, but I tried it and for me it doesn't.
For convenience, either move it to Start Menu\Programs\Startup (just type this in the location bar of File Explorer, Win10 will resolve it for you) or make a shortcut in there.
On a German keyboard, this works for XP and Windows 7, and the numeric keypad inserts the chosen decimal separator, no matter what it is (even if you choose '?' or something crazy). Chances are good it will work in Windows 10 and polish too.
I found a solution that involves only proper (though outdated) MS tools. You can create your own keyboard layout using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339). The official statement does not list any modern Windows version as supported, but I am currently writing using a modified layout I've created and installed on a Windows 10. The instructions are simple:
Note that this effects also other programs, like Excel - it will use that too. Maybe you actually like that, but maybe not.
