I'd like to be able to forward the connection permanently and forget about the original connection once a connection has been forwarded.  Thus acting like a 'router' rather than a proxy.
The problem is, the connection seems to be reliant on the original <IP>, since I noticed shutting down the Ec2 instance will cause the redirected connection(s) to terminate.  
I'm trying to create a front controller where users can connect to a specific port and have their connection redirected to a different IP/port.  The reason I'd like to be able to do this is for statistical reasons, since I would like to parse the log files later to see how many connections have been made to specific game servers (which I do not have access to) so I can adjust the 'popularity' ranks of each server based on the amount of connections it received. 
Note: I had considered using AWS Route 53 for this (using SRV records).  Although I would be able to redirect the connection, it appears retrieving logs/stats isn't possible.
