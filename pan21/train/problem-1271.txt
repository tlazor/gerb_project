It sounds like you have a fairly locked-down network environment, which is disallowing outbound connections destined for port 3306.  "Traditional" firewalls will only allow ACLs targeting IPs, not DNS names, so it sounds like the RDS URL will not work for you.  These firewalls operate at layers 3 and 4, so they have no concept of DNS names, which are a layer 7 concept.
If your company is blocking connections to 3306 specifically, as it's a well-known port, it's possible they may allow you to open up connections to a different port.  You could then recreate your instance to use that port rather than the default.
If the blockage is instead a blanket policy, implemented at layers 3 and 4, you may be out of luck for the moment.  You could do a DNS lookup of your instance's IP address and use it in an ACL, but that address is subject to change.
Normally I would say to ask them to open connectivity just for your client system's IP address, but as you say, they rejected that already.  I assume this is due to using DHCP to assign an address to your system, rather than a static IP.  Perhaps you could request a static IP for your system, or you could run your application on a company server with a static IP. That would allow them to complete a one-to-many ACL that they may find acceptable.
