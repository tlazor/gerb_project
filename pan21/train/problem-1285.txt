Microsoft provides you with C:\Users\Username and shortcuts to it and it's contents so that you don't have to go all the way to C:\Whatever and place things there. Why should C:\Intel, C:\Program Files\VLC or C:\Windows be indexed anyway?
Windows 7 Indexing should work perfect and provide the results you are looking for in a reasonable time, if I look for "Test" it shows me the folders and files I used for testing things in under a second.
If your performance is bad then you should reduce the locations that are being indexed and deselect the file types that you don't want to be indexed, this could need a bit of organization if you store things you do and don't want to serach together. It's like comparing a big pile of trash with a super market, where would you find anything quick?
If your results are bad then there are locations that are probably not being indexed or important file types that are deselected, this should not be an issue at first unless you are working outside the folders where you are supposed to be working in.
