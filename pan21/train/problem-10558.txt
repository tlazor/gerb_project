You could, try powering the device from a computer power, and that ironically might work, or vise-versa with other devices. 
There is the possibility, albeit remote, that there is a proprietary component in the way the USB plug is wired internally. 
In short, a cable doesn't always have the proper connection, and depending on the device, it may or may not accept it. The actual length of the cable doesn't apply to this.
I have a short micro USB cable that came with my bluetooth headset. It charges the headset just fine, but when I connect my phone to the same cable, using the same power source, it doesn't charge (no indicator, nothing). However, using the same power source with a different cable, the phone charges just fine.

My first thought is that your issue is due to how the pins on the male USB side make physical contact on the two different female USB connectors.
USB generally come in two flavor, power(charge-only) and data-cable. From the outside, they look exactly the same. Also quality of cable does matter for some applications. 90% you may not notice it. This is why you can generally take one cable from one device and have it work with another device. 
There are various reasons to why it won't work. Most point to type of cable. Here is some information on that aspect
