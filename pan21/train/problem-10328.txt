For most cases, it's simpler to use gluPerspective instead of glFrustum.  That lets you work in terms of the FOV and aspect ratio, which is more convenient than the width/height of the image on the near plane.  If you compare the formulas listed in the docs for gluPerspective and glFrustum you can see how these functions correspond to each other.  They do the same thing, except that gluPerspective has more convenient parameters, and doesn't handle off-center frusta (which are uncommon anyway).
zNear and zFar are measured in world space, not in anything to do with pixels.  Their scale will depend on the scale of the scene you're rendering and how close/far the camera will be to the geometry.  For instance, if your scene is modeled in meters, you might set zNear to 0.1 and zFar to 1000 or so.  This would let you get the camera as close as 10 cm from the geometry before it starts clipping, and let you see distances of up to 1 km.  You can adjust these values if you have a smaller or larger scene or if you use different units.
