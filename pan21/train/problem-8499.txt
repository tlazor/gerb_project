Mirroring system reserved partition first will work. Of course getting a RAID 1 should be supported by normal backup on external drive. RAID 1 fault tollerance is only for disc damage not to files.
Add the "System Reserved" partition as a mirror first, and then the C: partition (in your picture above, you have to right click and "remove mirror" from the extra disk first).  I have no idea what it means to find an extent for a plex, nor tried to see if the mirror really and truly becomes a bootable disk.  But at least it looks like it works.
I think what this basically means (and thanks MS for being as cryptic as possible with this error), is that since you created the mirror from your primary partition first, that there is no space at the beginning of the drive for the system partition, which must be first.  Probably the way to fix it would be to delete all partitions from the mirror drive and start over, creating the mirror of the reserved partition first, then the rest.
