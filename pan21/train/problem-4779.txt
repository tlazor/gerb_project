The basic premise of Diophantine approximation is that you take a dense countable set(traditionally the rationals or the algebraic numbers), $A$ in some range(generally $(0,1)$) and a function $H: A \to \mathbb N$, the height function. You then see how given $N \in \mathbb N$ close you can get a member of $A$, usually referred to as $\alpha$ with $H(\alpha) < N$. The most famous result from this field is Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem which states that for any real in $(0,1)$ there exist infinitely many rationals $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $|x-\frac{p}{q}| \le \frac{1}{q^2}$. This has been shown to be optimal up to a constant.
It's funny you should ask, because computability and diophantine approximation has actually been a popular topic in recent years. In particular Becher and Slaman and coauthors have many results and papers. See for instance
1) $H_c(\alpha)$ This is a restricted version of the above when the Turing machine is restricted to having $c$-characters not counting blank.
Noting that the number of transitions is approximately equal to $c+1$ times the number of states you get an equivalent statement for 2 that for $x \in (0,1)$ you get

For some $C>0$. I believe I can prove this. If it is true that using algebraic numbers of degree at most $d$ gives an approximation function of $|x-\alpha| \le cH^{-d-1}(\alpha)$ for some $c>0$ then I believe the same approximation function holds even if you use all algebraic numbers. The basic reasoning behind this is that it takes $O((d+1)\log_c(\max(a_1,\dots,a_{d+1})))$ states to output all the coefficients to the tape and then you should be able to do Newton's algorithm with a constant number of states. In the last equation $a_1,\dots,a_{d+1}$ is the set of coefficients of the minimal polynomial specifying $\alpha$.
The first 2 are basically variants on Kolmogorov complexity I believe. The last two I'm not even sure how to map to the Naturals.
A result I'd like to have and I believe is true is that the bounds on the approximation function for $3$ are optimal, that is that there exists $x \in (0,1)$ such that 
I was wondering if there is any research in the field of Diophantine Approximation using the computable numbers. It seems to be a good fit, a dense countable set with a variety of different potential height functions.
This is a cross-post from math.stackexchange. It was suggested to me that this site would be more likely to answer my question if there is any research or if this is worth pursuing any farther.
For some constant $C > 0$. Due to these results I'd say 2 is probably the nicest approximation function since $c^\frac{n}{c+1}$ when restricted to integer inputs is bounded by $\sqrt[5]{4}^n$ or roughly $1.3195^n$.
