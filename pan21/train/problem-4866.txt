On some consoles, it is required to have a loading screen if it takes more than x seconds to load, and the loading screen has to have a 'loading' animation if it takes more than x+y seconds to load. 
This is on console, where you know the device and can be quite certain that the time it takes to load a part of the game will be the same for all users. 
I was wondering if my 2D Pixel Art platformer HTML5 game(a lot of words there..) should have loading screens for maps.
My game has different maps and I don't know if a loading screen should be implemented to transition to those maps, they are already loaded when the page finished loading right?
Since this is in JavaScript, you don't have such control, so the time to load a part of the game will vary a lot from a user to another. 
If you're not able to stream content while the user is playing the game, and your game is made in such a way that the player could be waiting for a part of it to load, it would be advisable to plan to use a loading screen.
