Someone implemented a kernel-mode driver to do this magical feat for the wireless Apple keyboard. I am not sure if it works for a macbook. The FAQ says that an option is to install Windows "natively." Regardless, there is a good chance a small modification to the source code could get it working everywhere.
(there is also OSXFnBehavior but AFAIK this just controls that the function keys can be pressed without pressing Fn)
There are sooooo many discussion on the internet about swapping the fn and ctrl key on a MacBook Pro.
There is a registry key that may be able to do this, however I haven't found any documentation on it.
I remember there used to be a program (maybe it was on XP) that not only swapped the two keys but it also controlled the fans on the MacBook Pro. But I can't remember the name and I also recall that that program stopped being updated like years ago.
But on the PC side (specifically Windows 7), I can't really find a definitive answer. Most post refer to this article but I read the loooong article and followed the instructions to no avail.
It's a service you have to run in the background, but I've used it in the past when I was using an Apple keyboard on a Windows machine. It works pretty well--the only downside is that you need to have a service constantly running in the background.
