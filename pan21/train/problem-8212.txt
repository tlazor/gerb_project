Does there exist an agreed-upon recommendation or de facto standard for heterogeneous environments ?
F5 BIG-IP default http profile insert header accumulates an additional X-Forwarded-For at the end of a request's pre-existing collection of XFF headers, preserving order.
But what about an environment with multiple clients, proxies, CDNs, traffic-managers, servers that engage in manipulation of the X-Forwarded-For collection ? 
AWS ELB encourages consolidation of an incoming request's multiple X-Forwarded-For into a single header containing a comma-delimited list of XFF IPs, plus the user host address, preserving order.
There would seem to be an advantage to enforcing a uniform practice. But what is the best practice ?
IETF RFC 2616 Section 4.2 allows a request to contain multiple headers with the same field-name as long as chronological order of insertion is preserved and their values can be converted into single header with a comma-separated list of values.
Further, is any timestamp data provided that would allow code to definitively sort X-Forwarded-For headers in chronological order of addition for the case where previous manipulations of XFF headers are suspect.
