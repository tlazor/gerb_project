If the above is what you are getting, you need to clarify something with your provider - they will almost certainly provide these IP's to you over an additional IP outside this range, so the 5 static IP's will be on the LAN interface.     [If not, you will have a complex firewalling problem to solve (and, I'd argue, unless you have a switch with 5 routers hanging off it, or 5 devices each with there own firewall), configuring it would be  outside the scope of a Superuser]
The only equipment you will need is a router with firewall where you can turn off NAT.  Most consumer grade routers can be configured to do this - but you might want to get something which works with DD-WRT as the added functionality may help you later.   
Only the provider could tell you if upgrading to 13 usable IP's would be possible in a few months, it is technically possible to keep the IP's and only change the netmask IF THE ISP PREPARES FOR THIS UP FRONT or you get incredibly lucky - but most likely, unless you let them know your intention and they are agreeable, they would want to assign you a new subnet, which could well be in a different range.
It would be EXTREMELY RARE to get "5 static IP addresses" - what you will most likely get is a /29 = a subnet of 8 IP addresses, however the first and last IP address of the range can't be used as they are special addresses (broadcast and network), and 1 IP address is assigned to the router, leaving 5 useable IP's.
You would be able to set up computers to use more then 1 IP - unless they run Linux or equivalnet with complex routing (policy routing) this would really only be useful for incoming connections, as all connections initiated from the computer would prefer a particular connection.  You would want to use static IP addressing rather then DHCP.
