Pdfjam is a command-line wrapper around the pdfpages LaTeX package. Recent versions include a pdfbook tool which can generate at least simple booklets. You're asking for a less common layout, so it might not be directly achievable with pdfbook, but you can pass --tidy false to pdfbook to see how it invokes PdfLaTex, and tweak the LaTeX wrapper to get the desired page setup.
In one pass of TeX, pages have to be emitted in order. I don't think Pdf(La)TeX has an extension to change this.
However PdfTex is capable of reading pages from a PDF in random order. So you can use it as a tool to transform a pdf into another pdf with different page order, two pages in one and so on. The basic building block is the pdfpages package (it runs in PdfLaTeX) (it's in TeXlive, so it's probably already installed on your system).
instead of trying to rearrange the pdf pages, when you print the pdf using Acrobat Reader use the option of "Booklet" (or something similar), and Adobe Reader will handle the print order.
Not the answer for pdf, but psbook from psutils can arrange pages in a ps file so it can be printed as a book. Use psnup from the same software to put multiple pages per sheet if you cannot do when printing.
