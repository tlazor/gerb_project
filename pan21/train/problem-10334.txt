However, is it also possible to directly embed an image into the document to share the Markdown document with the image file directly contained inside it?
1) the referenced base64 block stops being parsed right at the point where 'a new chunk of image' starts, the green part ... So4Z4wxkXa7KukmKul2dDvd ...
This was tested with http://tmpvar.com/markdown.html. I don't know how it behaves on github. The issue has been already well discussed.
This is a screenshot of two base64 blocks inserted by using 1) an internal reference and 2) a common image insertion (see the code below).
Whether this will work of course depends on whatever youâ€™re using to (pre)view the document. It has to support and allow data: URIs.
There are methods like MIME and base64 to encode binary data into a text file in a sense, but most text editors and Markdown-renderers wouldn't know what to do with a MIME encoded document that contains a Markdown text part and a base64 encoded image part. 
I did some tests and embedding usually works with online markdown editors like dillinger.io, jbt.github.io, stackedit.io, so this topic isn't so black and white as @Spiff wrote above.
No, a Markdown document is just a text file, and text editors (even Markdown-savvy ones) wouldn't know what to do with a blob of binary image data in the middle of a text file.
