So basically, how do I setup an IPTABLE rule that will apply to the xen client instead of the xen host?
Notice that netfilter reads rules top-to-bottom and if you have a rule permitting all traffic to this client above (iptables -A adds rule to the end of the table), this new rule won't be reached and won't have effect.
But remember that xen inserts (i.e. places it at the beginning of firewall rules list) full-access rules on guest start. So, you should tune xen logic.
Next, I'm not sure, what is the goal of blocking traffic, going from port 25. If you client sends ab e-mail, he connects to remote server's port 25 but uses one of local ports (32k..64k by default) on his side. Couldn't you explain, what do you want to get as a result?
I didn't understand why you use "state" module if you a listing all valid states? It just uses CPU time and has no effect IMHO.
I rarely try to block DomU VM's so I can't tell you exactly what to do. But please refer to this page:
I'm trying to setup IPTABLES on my xen host server that will block incoming and/or outgoing access to a xen client on the same machine.  Specifically, I need to block outgoing port 25 traffic and incoming port 53 traffic to a specific container.
