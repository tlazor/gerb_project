I want to setup a firewall handling two ISP connections and two routers. For that I am planning to use an old Pentium 3 machine. Now, should I use four network interface cards or a 4-port NIC?
My suggestion: one gigabit ethernet card that can do vlan tagging in your preferred OS and a gigabit vlan capable switch.  
Whatever you do, have at least one spare, you don't want your firewall to be down with a NIC failure and have to scramble to order a new 4-port NIC or find a few spare NICs.
I'd go with two 2-port nics. They're generally easier to find, and you can get two for less than the price of a single 4-port. It also offers you more hardware redundancy in the rare even that one of them fails. For bonus points, get them from different vendors and avoid potential driver bugs as well. 
Of course, all of this may be unnecessary if you just use VLANs. A lot of the router setups I've done are "one-armed routers", with a single cable coming out and all networks going through that port as tagged VLANs.
