Definitely avoid installing an FTP daemon. As long as you have SSH, you have SFTP. No extra set up required. The only reason to use FTP is for the masses.
We're setting up a web server at our workspace. In conjunction, we're planning to install an FTP server, however I'm stuck at what protocol to employ -- FTP, SFTP or FTPS. I googled around, trying to see what protocol offers what, coming across articles like this, but I can't make up my mind. Only simple, once-in-a-while file transfer is desired; however, security is a concern since the file server is intended to be accessible from the internet.
I run an FTP server that also supports FTPES (FTP over explicit SSL) and I really see no advantages of it, aside from the fact that it is already in place. I inherited it, and all the user accounts and permissions work. But for everything else, I just use SSH/SFTP.
Any-one interested in some numbers here are my results from running some benchmarks on my local network. SMB 2.1 performance is about 112 MB/s
