My question is that. Is it common for VLC media player to play (actually jump to a time) WMV videos with poor performance in Linux? If not, what could be the problem?
I have Ubuntu 17.04. I have a collection of WMV files that played audio but with severely scrambled video under VLC 2.2.4 Weatherwax. I installed xx-restricted-addons and xx-restricted-extras but they didn't help. VLC 3.0.0-git Vetinari fixed the problem completely. I don't know if the restricted addons and extras played any role in fixing the problem.
My operating system is Linux Mint 18.1 and I'm using VLC media player 2.2.2 in it. VLC is very slow when I start a WMV video and/or jump to a time. Let's say Xplayer (Media Player), which is pre-installed in Linux Mint, jumps to a time in 0.1s, but it takes up to 3s in VLC.
Previously I was using VLC in Windows 7 also (on the same machine), there was no problem there. In addition, MP4 videos work fine in both Windows and Linux. I've reset preferences and disabled video effects in VLC, but it didn't solve my problem.
