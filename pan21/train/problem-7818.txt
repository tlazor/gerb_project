No, RAM is pretty resilient. Unless you had a lot of static in that area at the time, I think it is safe to say it is still in good condition. If you are that worried though and the RAM is new and you still have the receipt take it back to the store for a new one.
The odds of failure are negligible - I would feel comfortable juggling these things barehanded.  If I could juggle, anyway.
I wouldn't worry too much. If you are paranoid, pop it in a computer, and boot one of the live CD versions of memtest (you can also find it on a lot of live Linux disks). 
Even if it has failed, the odds of it damaging any other components are also negligible (more likely the machine just wouldn't boot).
RAMs fallen from 25 centimeters onto keyboard while in their plastic wrapping? Based on this I would say it's very very low probability (scientifically negligible) that they are damaged. 
Even if you're so unlucky and one or two of modules are really damaged, it won't spread to your CPU or GPU. OS simply won't start, maybe BSOD, but that's all.
