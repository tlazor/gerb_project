If there is only one router on a link which would generally elect a DR/BDR, that router may DECLARE itself the DR.  Re-election of the DR status will only happen upon the trigger of the AdjOK? event.  It appears that in the Cisco implementation of OSPF this can be generated in two ways:
Two routers, ethernet link, priority both set to default of 1, R1 sits exclusively in AREA 1 with RID: 192.168.23.3.  R2 is the ABR leading to AREA 0, RID: 192.168.23.2.  No other routers in AREA 1.
You really haven't provided enough information to be completely sure, but a router coming up first will decide it is the DR, and if there is already a DR, there will not be a DR election unless the DR goes down. Also, according to RFC 2328, OSPF Version 2, the BDR is elected first, which appears to be the case in what you have in your question. If Router 2 is the DR, then Router 1 is elected as the BDR.
Why is R2 winning the DR election?  This seems very straightforward that 192.168.23.3 RID should win for this segment.  Output of election process for perspective:
Ron Trunk and Ron Maupin generated all of the answer content, I simply produced this post for organizational purposes / clarity for future readers.
R2 via some mechanism was already considered a DR for the link R1/R2 shared and so, regardless of it having a lower RID, it maintained it's position as the DR for that link since DR status is non-preemptive in OSPF.
