It's hard to tell because the pic is a little blurry, but it looks like what's called a barrel connector (if I'm seeing correctly that it's a ring with a pin in the middle.  if it's actually a hole (not a pin), then it's probably an RCA connector).  You can pick up a barrel connector at a local hobby shop, or cut one that fits off an old power adapter if you're desperate.
According to the manual, the connection on the projector is a 3.5mm plug where the sleeve is ground and the ring is your signal.  You'd have to check your screen to see what kind of signal it's expecting. Looks like someone may have wired it up in a custom way to a wall plate, so you might be looking at a custom cable.
From the look of it, I'd guess someone custom made a cable that would connect to that wall plate.  If you have basic soldering skills, or know someone who does it should be pretty simple.
I googled a bit for a 3.5mm to barrel connector, but it's hard to tell what size connector you need, and they all seem to be for custom applications.
