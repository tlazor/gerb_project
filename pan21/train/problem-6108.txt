The "execute" permission is not used in native Win32/Win64 applications. It has been included for POSIX compatibility. As you probably are not using software requiring the POSIX APIs (Services for Unix / Interix and dependent software packages), you mostly can ignore the "Execute" permission.
It indeed does - again for POSIX compatibility. In UNIX, the "execute" permission bit on folders actually translates to "list contents". As I noted earlier, Windows does not implement the "Execute" permission anyway, but "List contents" is handled as expected.
This is a documentation error. Contact objects can be created in Active Directory and are somewhat similar to user objects except that they cannot log in and cannot be granted permissions for resources. You cannot assign NTFS permissions to a contact.
This is not a permission as such. It is just a check box to indicate that more granular permissions have been granted than the typical Read/Write/Full Control combinations you see in the simplified ACL GUI. Click on the "Advanced permissions" button and take a look at the granular access control entries for details.
