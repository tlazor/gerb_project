So I try to  see if the two "Switch" entries indicate different switches or two paths to to same switch, and I try the command "show cdp entry Switch". This is what I get:
Identically configured switches of identical models and software versions are identical in CDP; the advertisement doesn't include a MAC address or serial number that would differentiate the switches (though if desperate, you could capture the CDP packet - the source MAC in the ethernet header would give you that (though it may be spoofed, unsure of the exact behavior of the protocol).
So, the entries are the same for both switches, but the thing is, they are two different switches. And this is my problem: How can I find the true topology in such a situation?
But, that wouldn't be useful to you anyway - the purpose of CDP is for you to be able to track down the network topology without actually tracing cables; if your peer switches have no management IP addresses configured, then it's useless to be able to figure out how they're plugged in remotely, since you'll need to plug a serial cable into them anyway to manage them.
I have three cisco switches, all with CDP enabled. From the console of the "core" switch I give the command "show cdp neighbors" and the output is:
So, essentially: in the scenario you're describing, even with identifiers CDP is effectively useless, and once you've got your switches configured with an IP address it's no longer a concern.
