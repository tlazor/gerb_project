Is there a way to get into the repair console/environment as I said I have no disk drive so inserting dvd and repair from there is not an option. My only option seems to be via USB but am not sure how to go about that and am very close to chucking this nefarious machine out the window.
I installed server 2008 standard on an old laptop (Fujitso Siemens Amilo Pro V3515). All went well, configuring etc, and then I did windows update. After downloading all the necessary files the laptop continued to install them. As it was busy with .net3.5 at the time I had to leave but I checked that the laptop cable was plugged in etc. When I came back the laptop was dead (plug was never switched ON - can so damn nigh kick myself in the goonies for this!) and when I started it up, all I got was a black screen and fans running. Just to clarify, the screen comes on, but stays dull black. 
This laptop does NOT have a dvd drive and I installed via USB, but now I cannot seem to get into any repair mode or boot options or anything. When I restart (via power button as its the only way) and press whatever (F2, F8 or F12) nothing happens and the laptop just does its thing and fans are running and screen black. 
I have run into a snag and cannot for the life of me figure out the solution and was hoping someone here may have an idea as to what I can do.
If all else fails, is there an option to completely wipe this thing as I am getting desperate now I will just as much rather reload server 2008 from scratch just to get this thing working again.
