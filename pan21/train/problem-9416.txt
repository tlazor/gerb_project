I am having a similar problem with Vista 64, but it all started when oracle virtual box crashed once. My DVD drive was no longer recognized by windows after that, even though it runs fine if I boot into linux. I fixed the windows not recognizing my DVD drive problem by removing upper and lower limits in the windows registry. However, since that time my drive often fails to recognize both blank media and finalized CDR/DVDR media. If I go run the http://support.microsoft.com/fixit  tool for DVD/CD drives, the tool reports no problems and says nothing needs fixed, BUT my drive suddenly starts working after running the tool until the disk is ejected. Again, the DVD drive is working flawlessly with all types of media in linux.
After reading the advice in the first answer, I came up with a solution that used the same method but I needed to activate different services.
Remember to do this for each of these services. I'm not sure which one fixed it, as I automated both of their start-ups at the same time, but it worked for me. Hope it works for you too.
My dvd-rom works fine because I can play dvds on it, however when the dvd is a blank one the drive refuses to recognize it. So I can't burn dvds anymore because the drive shows up as empty in my disk burning software (dvd flick).
hey , i had this problem before on my friend's windows xp laptop.. but i am not sure if it would work with vista...
