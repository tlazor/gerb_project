I'd like to setup a system where on a site the default URL would be www.domain.com and it would look for public_html/live/, but if I set dev.domain.com it would look to public_html/dev/, BUT if I setup dev-live.domain.com it would look for public_html/dev/ and it would use the LIVE database.
I'm not sure how you intend on getting Apache to select the database, but you might be able to do that with mod_rewrite and setting DocumentRoot.
I'd like it to be setup so I only have to create a new directory within public_html in order to create a new subdomain, but still be able to maintain the ability to add -[INSERT_DB]
Since you also want to switch the databases dynamically, you will also need to change your application code to be smart enough to look at the incoming URL and use the correct database. You probably don't want to do that at the Apache level (just my opinion).
You should be able to use mod_vhost_alias to get the arbitrary virtual hosts working with something like this:
I know it's possible to setup this system using a code of code, and a lot of pain-in-the-butt to maintain virtual hosts, but is there a dynamic way where it checks to be sure the folders exist?
