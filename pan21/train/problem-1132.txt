I've also included the output of dmesg when I plug it in if that helps. I don't have access to any other OS, so I can't just try something on Windows.
I'm trying to reformat a micro SD card that was previously in a raspberry pi (and had stopped working). However, when I plug it into my main computer (arch) and try to partition it, I can't because gparted says it has no partition table. When I try to fix that by adding a partition table (GPT), I get the errors below. How can I fix my uSD card?
It essentially breaks down to disable optional feature querying, which effectively hangs the card reader hardware:
Please note, that it still is a workaround and may fail in the future. You should disable the workaround on future kernel versions to see if the bug has been fixed.
This SD card is defective or damaged or the electrical pins are bad.  Try again after cleaning them.  If it still fails, then it is time for a new SD card.
The options will be loaded when booting up in the future. If it does not, you may try to hack the temporary fix into a startup script, as a very dirty, but possible, solution.
There is a known bug in the Linux Kernel 4.4-rc4 and later (It still persists today). You can read about this bug and a possible workaround on kernel.org.
Try again with your SD card. It may take some seconds to initialize though (because the queries still time out, but we ignore that now).
