DO note that this machine will keep you awake 24/7 if you run it anywhere inside your house - these boxes are meant to run in datacenters and produce a LOT of noise.
My concern with this box is the disks. That's a five to six year old system, which puts the disks inside (assuming they are original) near their expected life cycle.  Everything else in there looks okay. You're basically working with a pair of 2.4Ghz Pentium 4's from a performance perspective, but for what you're doing that should be adequate. Even a new Atom cpu would give equivalent performance, and a Core i3 should be a lot faster, but you'll have a hard time getting either in a full system for $100 and the experience working with real server hardware will be worthwhile.
The server you linked to is a Home and Special Use server. I wouldn't even use that as a Small Business server. It lacks almost all the features a SysAdmin would expect in server grade hardware. The only benefit is that it comes with some warranty out of the box.
If the disks are good, this is excellent value for money, and the only bottleneck you might encounter is if you want to run stuff besides web servers on it, such as busy PHP scripts and/or database servers.
Any Linux distro will support HP Proliant servers just fine; all the relevant hardware support has been in the mainline kernel for years.
Either would work fine as a simple web server. The DL380 is HP's bread-n-butter server. Getting familiar with one, even if it's several generations old, is going to benefit you in the long run (assuming you're going to expand to "real" servers at some point.
