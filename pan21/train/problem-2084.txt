The easy solution is to just have full table everywhere but if some routers aren't up for it (limited TCAM or similar) you might need to opt for using a default route.
With two default routes you can achieve redundancy but other routers in your network will just follow the default route to the closest core router so load balancing might not be according to your needs.
Make sure that your core routers have a direct link between each other and exchange the full table over the iBGP session between them. If both core routers inject a default route but one loses its ISP link it needs to see the routes from the other core router so it still have valid paths to the Internet.
With full tables like this you can also fine-tune the local-preference/MED/whatever of routes you receive from respective ISP to achieve more even load balancing. Do note how your other routers will still follow the default so traffic might go via one core router to the next core router and exit to your ISP. Full table avoids that.
