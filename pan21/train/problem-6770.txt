I have a MySQL application (MySQL 5.5) running on a virtual Ubuntu 16.04 (64bit) server with 2 kernels and 8 GB RAM. I consists of a few, small RW tables and appr. 30 read-only InnoDb tables with 100-150k rows in each (totaling ~ 1-2 GB data + indexes). Almost all queries gather data from several of the read-only tables (lots of different joins).
The overall performance of MySQL/MariaDB/Percona and InnoDB/XtraDB etc, is minimal.  There are specific cases where one shines over another.  You should not expect a magical improvement.
Blindly making changes to improve 'overall performance' rarely works very well. Have you run into any performance issues? Are you experiencing some slow queries? Can you post the explain statements for these queries? Is the server running out of memory and swapping?
Also, there's a chapter in O'Reilly's High Performance MySQL which deals with diagnosing CPU-bound, memory-bound and IO-bound workloads, along with lots of other information about fixing performance issues. If you have time and inclination, I'd highly recommend giving that a read.
High I/O:  Same as high CPU, plus poor Joins, excessively sized datatypes (eg, BIGINT where SMALLINT UNSIGNED would suffice), etc.
Adding RAM won't help -- your dataset is significantly smaller than RAM.  But do check innodb_buffer_pool_size.
