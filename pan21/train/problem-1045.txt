For any OS that worth its salt, really "free" memory should be really small amount - just few megabytes. All remaining memory is devoted to caching disk data. If some program requests big memory block using malloc or GlobalAlloc, non-important data cached for read is thrown away to satisfy this memory allocation request.
In other words, if you have 32GB RAM, and you start playing your game which weighs in at 13GB, Windows will try to actively cache all 13GB in RAM. However, it does not mean that it will stay in that cache forever, because most likely data is highly compressed, and as Starcraft needs to unpack this data in memory to be able to manipulate it and create your gaming world representation, it might try to allocate a lot of memory from Windows, which may force it to throw away some of that cached content (but even then, in least recently used manner).
Your operating system is already doing exactly what you wanted - it actively caches in RAM all data that was read from your hard drive in most recently used fashion.
One interesting property about this caching is that even if you have 32-bit application which cannot allocate more than 4GB of RAM, files accessed by this application will be still cached by your 64-bit OS, even if total size of all files is well beyond 4GB.
On a practical note, probably easiest way to speed up load times is to use SSD drive. Modern SSD drives typically have read speed around 500MB/s - around 5x faster than typical hard drive. What's better, SSD read speed does not take a huge nose dive on reading really small files (for standard hard drive, read speed could be 100x slower for small files).
