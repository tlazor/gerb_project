As others have said, you should only do this when you really need it for something, as it is very easy to mess up your system with this method. 
If you still want to do it though, I recommend using the Testing repository, rather than the sid repository, as this repository is usually a little more stable. 
As a sidenote, if you want the rest of your webserver up-to-date, I can recommend the dotdeb repository for that.
I'm having the same issue right now, and since these are production boxes I'm nervous about the downtime of doing a full upgrade, so I'm thinking of using Shadur's sid repo solution; of course, I'll be testing in my dev environment first to ensure there are no issues with it.
Additionally, in response to the comments about why someone would want to do this upgrade, there are security vulnerabilities in versions 1.3.x, 2.0.x-2.0.64, and 2.2.x:
The way to do this is exactly the same as in hangover's answer, only replace sid with testing. Both repositories have Apache 2.2.22.
