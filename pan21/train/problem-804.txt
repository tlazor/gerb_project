Would that mean having both setup on A  so that records for the respective VPCs are uniquely managed from within project A.
If I understand it correctly, that would mean having the DNS setup on the producer network A, and let the networks B and C forward their respective queries to A.
We have a master project A, and two other projects, B and C. In project A, we have a shared VPC with networks A, B, and C (related to which project they're meant to serve). The VPC for B is shared from project A to project B, and the VPC for C is shared from project A to project C. The networks are peered with each other.
Any help here would be appreciated. I'm aware that private zones in Cloud DNS are still a Beta feature, but this setup should currently be possible according to the documentation.
From the same page, it also explains that there is DNS Peering beta available, whereby a Consumer Network can forward DNS requests to a Producer Network.
An instance on network A will be able to resolve a domain from the network A DNS server, but not from a network B DNS server, and vice versa. However, if you explicitly define the DNS server, it works as expected.
For example, let 10.0.0.1 have an A record for foo.com, and 10.0.1.1 have an A record for bar.com. They are hosted on network A and network B respectively: 
Cloud DNS appears not to be sharing properly across these networks. With experimentation, we have found that instances will be able to resolve records that are on a DNS server on the same network, but not on another network. ie:
Within project A, we have a private Cloud DNS zone which forwards to two DNS servers. One of these servers is in project A and network A, and one of them is in project B on network B. We have selected all networks (A, B, and C) to be included in this DNS zone.
I would like to try it as well, moreover because on top of this I have a VPN with on-prem (let's call it D) and the next step would be to setup a conditional forwarder to the on-prem DNS.
