It sounds like you've installed it correctly, but your verification step is incorrect. OpenSSL doesn't know where to look to find root certificates unless you explicitly tell it.
So my question is: Is there something wrong with my mailserver or am I just using the openssl command incorrectly? And should I include the root certificate in the chain or not?
Try openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:25 -starttls smtp -CApath /etc/ssl/certs instead. That should work.
I created chain.crt per Postfix instructions by concatenating my certificate and the two intermediate CA certs. (To be precise, my own cert first, then COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt and then COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt) According to the logs, most connections to my mail server are now encrypted so everything seems to work.
I have tried adding the AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt to the end of chain.crt which makes the error message change to verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain. Besides, the machine I'm connecting from already has this certificate installed so there should be no need for it.
However, when I connect to the server using openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:25 -starttls smtp I get the following output, which seems to indicate that something is wrong:
