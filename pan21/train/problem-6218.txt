If you don't want to add anything/or change the existing Excel tables, you can link to them in Access and run a basic query there. (Let me know if you want details on how to do this.)
If the cells would be in the exact same location in each sheet, you can use a third sheet, then fill down and right with this formula:
Just my two cents, as nobody mentioned it here so far you could try also Excel Compare by Formula Software (it's paid software but comes with a free trial period).
Anyway the best solution, in my opinion, is maybe already stated on your question's comments: export to CSV and then use any diff-tool you like to compare, simple! (a list of diff-tools here)
If you want to see info from table 2 in table 1, use VLOOKUP. If you just want to know if a row is in both tables, use COUNTIF.
It's not free and it might be overkill for your needs, but Beyond Compare has done a great job of comparing Excel sheets for me.
The main two formulas I would use in Excel are =COUNTIF(range, criteria) and =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, FALSE). COUNTIF counts how many times criteria in table1 is found in range table2. If the result is greater than zero, then the row is in both tables. VLOOKUP looks up the lookup_value table1 in table_array table2 and returns the value in column col_index_num. If VLOOKUP doesn't find a match, it returns NA().
There are several formulas you can use in Excel depending on what you want to do. The formulas all require a single-column key on both tables that they use to match rows. If you don't have a single-column key, then you need to create one. For example, if your data is in B2 to H500 and the key is the first three columns, create your single-column key in cell A2 with =B2&"-"&C2"-"&D2 and copy it down to the other rows. Do this in both tables and now you have a key column to use.
