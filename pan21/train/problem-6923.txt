There's a couple places where your variables don't seem to have the right units. It may help to write out (on paper) what units each of your variables is and check the units with dimensional analysis.
I think you want method 1, not method 2. I assume you a constant turn rate towards the desired heading? In that case, torque, being angular force, is not what you'd want to use here. (You'd need infinite torque to get the initial immediate start, and then infinite torque to stop immediately at the target direction) so the first method is more accurate.
With these changes, it should remove the wobbling, which was caused by an incorrect impulse calculation that always overshot the desired value.
The following two lines seem wrong to me as well -- your desiredAngularVelocity is angular velocity (unit: 1/time), and not a rotation (radians are unitless), you need to divide by a time variable. Also, the change variable has some  you're not allowing 1 degree rotation per timestep, you're allowing 180 degrees rotation per unit time (i.e, second). 
The following two lines of code clamp totalRotation/tempSpeed to [-π, π]. Assuming tempSpeed is  your maximum angular velocity, this doesn't make much sense to me. I think you should remove the tempSpeed parts, and thus the logic is that "total rotation" needs to be in that range.
