Obviously for SQL Server Browser to do its job, it needs to be started. Start it, and change the start up type to automatic. 
Named instances listen on dynamic ports. Is the job of the Sql Server Browser Service to inform the clients of the actual port. The Sql Browser listens on UDP 1434 and answers questions of the form 'what is the listenning port of instance "foo"?'. Sql Server Browser service is required for both TCP and named pipes protocols. Clients use the SQL Server Browser transparently, no need for special configuration. By simply specifying an instance name in the connection string (or the ODBC DSN), the client library know it has to contact the SQL Server Browser service first.
As a side note, an often used alternative configuration is to use static ports for the named instance and specify the port in the connection string (tcp:<hostname>:<port>). It has the advantage of taking SQL Server Browser out of the equation, but it requires careful maintenance of clients. Changing the listening port requires orchestrated changes at all clients, all machines, all locations, usually a big pain. I recommend taking the dependency on SQL Server Browser instead.
