I am soon launching a web application with the intention of making a profit off membership sales. The application uses Flask (I already tested deploying using Elastic Beanstalk). I also make use of RDS because I use a MySQL database.
I will provide more information if requested. I am a beginner in all AWS-related concepts, so I am still uncertain about what I should do after looking at online tutorials. I figured a T2 would make most sense because it is cheap and general purpose. I am not sure about what size I need though.
What do you think is an appropriate EC2 instance for this task? I am currently using Free Tier t2.micro for testing, but am trying to plan for the future. I want to make sure it can handle let's say 20-100 users as the same time. Am I better off staying in the Free tier? 
I am trying to figure out my server needs. The application mostly just redirects to different pages and occasionally evaluates a Keras machine learning model. This will at first have 0 users as I am just starting.
