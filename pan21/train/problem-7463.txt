If you have the correct hardware, I would recommend you take a quick look at Xen Client, which is currently available for free from Citrix Systems.
I used it briefly on a ThinkPad T400 with... mixed success. The machine booted into the Xen Client environment extremely quickly, and from there, running everything feels just a little bit compromised. You have the same resource juggling game you do for virtual machines on a desktop, relatively few types of clients are supported right now, discrete graphics are (or were when I tried) unsupported and power management was not quite as good in the XenClient environment as it is when I was booting Windows Vista or Windows 7 natively.
I don't know how well the support for non-windows guests is, but I was able to run XP and 7 concurrently with no significant issues. One potentially nice thing is that if you're running XenServer on a server or desktop somewhere, you can run the synchronizer VM on your server and automatically back up the clients on your laptop.
