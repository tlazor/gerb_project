Putting the ss flag before the input file is going to be a 'rough guess' in terms of PTS, but has to snap to an I-frame to work.  It happens much more quickly than putting the ss flag after your input file, but at a cost of being less accurate.
I have a video with forced keyframes every 2 seconds. Ideally, I was hoping I'd be able to get frame-perfect slices without having to re-encode. For example:
Whatever I do, I get the same result. If I look at the PTS for the original for frame 60, I get 2.002000 (instead of 2). But, even if I use this for my slice, I get the same offset.
(Probably not realted, but I'm also curious why the first frame of 0_slices.mp4 has an offset PST/DST, even though the original doesn't)
When you put the ss flag after the input file, FFmpeg will decode from the beginning of the file all the way through until your -ss time starts.  It then dumps all of the information before the ss time... So it takes much longer, but it should be accurate.
Digging more into it, it looks like the first slice is frame-accurate, but everything after that has a slight offset (it might have other problems, but I'm just focusing on this for now). The first frame appears ok:
