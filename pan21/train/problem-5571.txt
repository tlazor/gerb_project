Two mobile technologies that come to mind which do not use SIM cards are 802.16 and 802.11 (WiMax and Wi-fi). 
The point of the SIM card is to encrypt a unique identifier which corresponds to your phone number. This SIM contains encryption keys which allows the phone companies to secure your communication channel to prevent it from being sniffed by a third party for your privacy. This also prevents people from spoofing your unique ID and cloning your phone. There are other ways for dealing with this even within in the telecommunications industry, CDMA providers like Sprint used other ways of achieving this goal, but ease of use and standardized equipment just isolated sprint and increased their networking costs and they have now switched to SIMs too. There are certainly disadvantages to SIM based networks, but there are advantages as well. In the case of cellular communications, the benefits match the need and are therefore the right tool for the job - and there is nothing archaic about that.
