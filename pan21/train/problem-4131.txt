The article describes some VBA code that can be implemented to achieve what is needed, but if like me, you are looking for a quick and simple solution then a work-around is also provided.  For convenience, here is the process:
When add a property, for example Insert > {Text} Quick Parts > Document Property > Title, it displays in the document inside a rounded rectangle with a grip displaying the property name and does not look like a normal field.  I can edit any of the references to this quick part in the document and all other reference automatically change.
Unfortunately, it looks like this is currently not yet available (in Microsoft 2010).  The closest solution I have found is described in this article, see section 7 - Content Controls.
Note that this will update the Table of Contents, links, etc. as well. If you want to just update a single field, select it and press F9.
I think, like the OP, I am looking for a way to add Quick Part Document Properties in a way that allows direct editing from the document itself without needing to go through all the dialog boxes associated with changing the value of a document field.
