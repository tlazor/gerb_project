Chipset - some chipset and designs are better at differentiating between the signal and noise then others.  This can make a massive difference.
Multiple antennas and radios.  Newer devices have multiple antennas to help work out where a signal is coming from and cancel out noise, to effectively boost the amount of data/range.  Depending on the circuitry in the sender and receiver this may work better or worse.
Different frequencies - newer (802.11ac) devices can work on 5 and 2.4 gig bands.  If the older device does not have an 802.11ac chip, they may be using a saturated band in the 2.4 gig range, as opposed to cleaner, more plentiful (but not as far reaching) channels in the 5 gig band.
One factor is the channel width. Some devices can handle combined channels, others can't.  This can mean a significant increase in speed for the device that can use 2 channels over the device that can use only 1 (assuming the router supports it)
Firmware - Buggy firmware can slow things down quite a lot and cause unreliablity, by not correctly implementing the standard.
In a nutshell, its all about "Signal to Noise" ratio - the greater the signal to noise ratio, the greater the throughput.   (relatedly, the greater the spectrum used , the greater the amount of signal)
Antenna design - Bigger antennas generally provide better reach in practice.  Thus if you have an antenna on a cellphone it may be smaller and not able to go as far as a larger laptop antenna.  Similarly the spacing between multiple antennas can make a difference - larger spacing is often better, but the device may not have space for it.
