Digital Cinema Initiatives has specified the DCI 4K and 2K resoultion standards (4096 × 2160 and 2048 × 1080). These are the full frame resolutions for digital cinema projectors, with many films displayed in the a crop format such as flat crop (3996 × 2160 , 1.85∶1 aspect ratio) or CinemaScope crop (4096 × 1716, ≈2.39∶1 aspect ratio).
Different K measurements were later standardised for digital cinema (2005) and consumer television (2007).
The 4K standard for consumer television (UHDTV1) can be more accurately labelled as Ultra HD or Quad HD. It is equivalent to 4 Full HD frames placed together. It is 3840 × 2160 with ≈1.78∶1 aspect ratio.
The Wikipedia article on 4K resolution provides a helpful visualisation which compares different frame sizes.
Attie has explained how vertical pixel counts were derived for traditional resolutions such as SD (480p), HD (720p) and Full HD (1080p). I would like to discuss K measurements which originate from the cinema industry. A K is about 1000 horizontal pixels and 2K and 4K were casual terms referring to resolutions of approximately 2000 and 4000 horizontal pixels.
