As long as there were no nicks in the PVC sheathing, you should be alright (http://www.cat-5-cable-company.com/faq-bury-burial-cat-5-cable.html). 
Replacing the bundles would be expensive. If you've got it in your budget (or insurance will pay for it), do it. 
My argument for re-running the cable would partly be that you can't reasonably ensure the current cable will dry instead of growing mold/mildew and turning into a slimy nasty mess.
Water can affect fiber optic cables and splices if the water freezes, causing a macro-bend, which creates optical power loss. 
Depends on the conditions of the cables, where it got in ect, for example there would need to be openings in the insulation on the cat5 to do any major damage.
Know that if you don't rerun the cables, this event is going to be the scape-goat for all future network performance issues forever, until more cables are run. 
I don't think the water will have any immediate effect as long as the water never entered the cables--obviously copper wiring will oxidize if given the chance.
Since the passages are poorly ventilated apparently, there also comes into question a health risk with the growth of fungus and moulds.
It's hard to tell if you had any nicks in the plastic, but I imagine that you're going to find out. Do you have any spare cables in the bundles? I would save yourself the time of panicking during an emergency and find and label them now. Create documentation on how to replace a poorly performing cable with a spare.
