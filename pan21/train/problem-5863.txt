If you need to reinstall Windows 7, then do so.  The product key on the COA (Certificate of Authenticity) sticker on the box is the one you should use if prompted for one.  It's POSSIBLE if the PC is a major brand (Dell, HP, etc) that Windows will auto-active when re-installed with a Windows 7 disk included with the PC.
Bottom line - if this computer was purchased with Windows 7 and purchased from a reputable vendor, then you should have problem reinstalling 10 times if you need and activating each time.
Product keys are NOT use once and stop.  They can be activated multiple times on the hardware they came with.  In the event there is a problem with Activation, you can call MS and they should help you activate over the phone.
A quick Google of the problem and I found that you are able to use the same key again, but only if there are no other systems currently using that key. So you should be in the clear.
I want to re-install my windows 7 OEM, so that I can delete my old employees files, software, etc. As per this link, I can do re-install windows 7, my doubt is If I do this reinstallation would I be prompt to enter product key or not If so can I enter same key that I have used before.
