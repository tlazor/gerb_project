The course material, then, is somewhat secondary to the central concern. Carefully chosen, however, it becomes the motivation for the more central learning.  
The most important goal is to make emotionally healthy, capable, empowered adults who can solve the problems that life throws at them in the future.  We don't get to know what those problems are. Many of the problems don't exist yet. We don't get to know what tools will be available to solve the problems. Many of the tools don't exist yet.  All of which leaves us with the central challenge: we ultimately must teach our students to be adaptive, flexible thinkers and learners.
This is important: every school that I've ever heard of offering a class like "study skills" eventually dropped it.  Directly studying how to learn does not appear to serve us well. We need rich systems to engage with, and we then come to the meta-learning slowly  and in due time.  That is what the course material accomplishes for us. It is the rich set of motivating material with which we can empower people to solve the problems of the future.
Flexibility comes from learned patterns of thinking (literally patterns and formations of neurons that allow us to easily integrate similar future patterns of thinking) and from meta-learning knowledge (e.g. "I am capable of learning new material when I need to by breaking things down into steps", or "I tend to learn more easily from books than from videos").
