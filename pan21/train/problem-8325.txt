Having all nameservers on the same box (VPS or not) and even on the same subnet isn't recommended. Some kind of backup DNS service could help.
As for the website -- your question is too general without knowing the specifics.  It really depends on the load, number of visitors, whether the site is static or dynamic. For lightweight websites, that VPS may be enough. If you use things like MySQL, you could run this on a different server or VPS. Again, the VPS that you have may or may not be enough, depends on the site you run.
It also depends on whether your VPS provider oversells a lot or not. You may find yourself with slow responding VPS depending on that. Some visualization technologies provide more separation of VPS instances than others.
I currently run smtp, imap, clamav, web and database services on a single VPS from ElasticHosts - it's a little higher spec than yours, but it copes just fine.
The benefit of most VPS providers is that they are very flexible, so it's pretty easy to add capacity to your account as you need it. Go with running it all on one host for the time being - you can always buy new capacity in future, if you need it, either by expanding the current VPS or by purchasing a new one.
