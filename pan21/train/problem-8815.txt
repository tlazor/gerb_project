I've seen those errors in our Windows 2003 SP2 TS server. It's rebooted every night (just like yours) for legacy app compatibility reasons.
I assume you've already checked this but but in the past I had some harddrive space problems that led us to a similar scenario.
It looks like you are not using STATIC IP addresses but it could be an imaging problem. I highly suggest that you set up static IP addresses if you already don't. Each terminal server should have its own static IP address and be manually configured to point to the proper domain controller. 
This specific error could be several things. I have a feeling that the terminal servers you have were imaged. There is a good chance that after they were imaged the virutal network adapter was not re-made; thus, the NIC info is the exact same for all the servers. If they were imaged and if this is the case, I suggest copying what information you have for the virtual adapters (take a photo of it or something... ip address info, dns and wins info, dns suffixes, etc.) and then then re-create the virutal adapter. All the terminal servers could be trying to communicate and the network gets confused... as 3 servers have the same NIC info. Also, be sure to check all your information. Make sure your subnet mask is correct (probably 255.255.255.0).
I have had a situation much like this where I seemed to be able to use the computers directly, but I was not able to remote in. I found that due to imaging the machines, my virtual adapters needed to be re-made. I hope this helps!
