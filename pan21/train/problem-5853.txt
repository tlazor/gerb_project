As soon as I run netplan try, I can no longer ping my external IP 78.111.203.13 until the timeout and the network resets itself. Interestingly though, I can still ping the external IP from other VM's within the network - I'm not sure if that means anything?
The default gateway is the address of the router which will route packets for which you don't have routes defined already. About 99% of the time, this is the router which will provide your system access to the Internet. Any host will have exactly one of these (per protocol) in a normal configuration.
My interface ens160 is already fully configured. However, when I try and setup ens192 and apply the settings with netplan apply, ens160 stops pinging externally.
You've defined two, so one conflicts with and overrides the other. Because it is not your gateway to the Internet, you should remove it again.
I've got a VM running Ubuntu 18.04 - it's all setup and running on a single public IP and has two interfaces - ens160 (public) & ens192 (private).
