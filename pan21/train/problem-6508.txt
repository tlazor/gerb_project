As a developer, I have just finished work on a web application that allows batch export of various 1D barcodes and QR codes. The end result is a HTML page filled with barcode images.
Any information regarding printing HTML pages efficiently with a label printer is more than welcome.
Does the automatic cutting system also work when using particular software? Is there a setting the specify the length at which each label should be cut?
The label printer I have in mind also has an automatic cutting system. I have been searching around, but cannot seem to find out how exactly this works.
There are a lot of settings that allow the user to modify the look of the barcodes, rotate the images, etc.
I have read that most modern label printers are plug and play, and that you can use them like any other printer. I take it that as long as all output in my HTML page is not wider than 36mm (the maximum label width), these labels will be printed fine?
The last step will be printing these HTML pages with a label printer. To test this, I am planning on getting a label printer like the Brother QL 570.
I expect that the label printer will cut at page breaks (I only have seen label printers with fixed size labels, I'm assuming you're talking about continuous labels?).
