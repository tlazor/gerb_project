You could use one of the more fully featured backup utilities for this. Such as SyncbackSE or one of many others. A decent backup utility will allow detection of the appropriate drive when it is attached and allow running of a script that can remove the redundant backup before copying the new backup.
Personally, I no longer do things this way for my own computers. I accept the overhead of rebuilding a computer if it breaks since the likelyhood is that the OS and all of the applciations will have moved on and it is likely to be a good idea to rebuild from scratch anyway for the odd occasion these things happen. For data, I use CrashPlan to make 2 backups. One to another PC on-site so that I can restore data quickly (this is free with CrashPlan). The other to the CrashPlan remote servers (this is charged of course though a family plan is very reasonable for up to 10 computers with unlimited storage. You can replace this by doing a space swap with some one off site, which is free). CrashPlan is fully encrypted and supports multiple version backups.
