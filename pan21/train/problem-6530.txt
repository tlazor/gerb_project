Considering these zones are hosted on the same server, is it possible to have delegation working from example.com to ddns.example.com? For example if my workstation's search domain is example.com and pointed towards 10.1.10.1 for its DNS provider, I would like to be able to resolve hostname.ddns. As it is, I can resolve hostname.ddns.example.com, but would like to be able to resolve just hostname.ddns.
Alternatively, if the workstation's search domain is ddns.example.com, what settings do I need to be able to change to be able to resolve web, ftp, etc, which are all hosts in the parent, example.com zone? Does the ddns.example.com zone need to forward to the example.com zone? Again, all the zones are setup on the same server with a second server setup as a slave.
I have two servers running BIND, the first is setup as the master of two zones and the second as a slave for those zones. The zones are example.com and ddns.example.com. I have DDNS running and thousands of device entries are dynamically created in ddns.example.com. I wanted to keep DDNS separate from the main example.com, so I created a separate zone that the DHCP servers update.
