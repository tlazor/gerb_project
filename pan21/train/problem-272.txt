My suggestion would be to test against a node at the ISP, preferrably the remote end of your circuit/connection. Anything upstream from the ISP is beyond their control and irrelevant to the problem (meaning there's nothing they can do about upstream packet loss or packet loss that isn't occurring on their network).
In addition, ping isn't a good tool for testing and reporting packet loss, as far as I'm concerned. Responding to ICMP traffic may be given low priority by upstream nodes or it may be dropped entirely. Routers are concerned with routing "real" traffic, not responding to your ping test. I would suggest you use something like Ixia QCheck or iperf to test for packet loss using real traffic.
The symptoms you state in your follow-up sound a lot like over subscription with the ISP's peer(s). This is very hard to prove. Most SLAs only cover connectivity to the ISP not the ISP's connectivity to the rest of the Internet. I would get another Internet provider, negotiate down your level of service with your current (if possible) for the remainder of the contract and drop them at the end of the contract. You can use them as a backup provider until the contract runs out so you don't have to write it completely off.
