Good call on burning your CD. If your machine even HAS USB ports, you can't really use USB sticks because seamless support was added after Windows 98.
I have an old Windows 95 computer that appears to be full of malware. I can't connect it to the internet (because I don't have dial-up anymore) but I want to take out all of the viruses off there. Is there an antivirus compatible with Windows 95 that I can burn to CD and install, and that comes with a database? Or a virus removal tool (because I won't ever be hooking it back up to my network)?
In spite of this, my experience with a Windows 98 install years ago was that antispyware tools couldn't fully clean it, probably because of fewer testers. Good luck
At a minimumm, tools aware of legacy needs demand at least Windows 98. It doesn't matter what your version of Windows is: serious antivirus freeware will not even need you to run windows and install it. Instead, many boot CD's you boot from the CD and run it independently of any Windows version. As a nice perk, the tools aren't blinded by any intentional potential rootkits inside your infected system.
Although you indicated the desire to save the existing install, just in case it comes having to do a wipe and clean install I'll post it as an answer.
