Your problem looks like that router could have previously been set up for some other site, and needs to have the setup changed to fit your site instead of the other one.
I spent some time troubleshooting with my ISP and was able to (somewhat) isolate the issue. They provided me with a static IPv4 address to use for the WAN settings in my router, and said I can have my router do NAT/DNS/etc.
On the working Netgear and Apple routers my ISP confirms that although I am using multiple client devices, they are all using the same public IP address (expected). With the TP-link router, each client device gets its own public IP address. Even though NAT and settings match those on the netgear and Apple router. We tried renewing DHCP leases and even cloning the WAN MAC, but result was the same.
I would expect you to need to tell the new router what IP address it should use on the ISP side of the router, and possibly also which DNS server or servers it should use.  You may also need to make sure it handles local IPv6 addresses, and may need to tell it which local IPv6 addresses it should allow connections for.
I duplicated the router settings on three different home wireless routers: Netgear wrt54g, an Apple N wireless router, and the new TP-Link AC wireless router. Networking works as expected with the Netgear and the Apple router, but for whatever reason the TP-link router does not behave as expected. Since I don't care to troubleshoot the TP-link router any further I ordered a new Apple AC router.
