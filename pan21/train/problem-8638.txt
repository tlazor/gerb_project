Making the remapping script is straightforward - I would link an example but my currently low rep on this site prevents that at present. The first result in a google search for "AHK mapping mouse as keyboard" without quotes should get you there.
Let me know if you need help making an AHK script, or you can find many examples of such a script via Google search.
If it were me, I would start a keyboard/mouse hook script in AHK, do a single middle mouse "click", then view the key history to see what input is being mapped. Use this AHK webpage (scroll all the way down to the Special Keys section) for a tutorial on how to do that.
I don't have an arc mouse, so I can't do this myself, but I would use some kind of listener hook to find what input is passed from the driver when the "single" middle click you are looking to use is pressed. You could try looking at event viewer (search for event viewer after pressing the windows key) as you press the middle mouse, or try looking at code generated by Microsoft IntelliPoint's macro record program. XMBC has a built in listener (buttons are highlighted yellow when pressed), but it only listens for a standard set of buttons, so I'm guessing that the single middle click doesn't register there.
Another possible workaround is to make a script that maps a keyboard button you don't use often to "middle mouse click" and use that script when you use programs that require a middle mouse click for navigation.
