There's an alternative to an IF formula and conditional formatting that does both with a single format, provided that the true/false decision isn't complex. For positive and negative values, a custom number format for a cell will display a value with formatting that includes text and font colors. A cell formatted this way will look like this:
The sections can also specify number formats that will be displayed only if a number meets a condition by enclosing the condition in square brackets. The condition is a comparison operator and a value. For example, the following format displays numbers that are less than or equal to 5 in a red font and numbers that are greater than 10 in a green font. Additional formats, such as fill color and borders, can be applied with conditional formatting.
Select the Custom category of Format Cells... to define this custom number format: [Green](_((+0));[Red](_((-0));0. The number format has three sections separated by semicolons. The sections define the format for positive numbers, negative numbers, zero values.
