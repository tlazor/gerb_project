Screensavers are for saving your screen, not conserving power.  If you want to save on power disable the screensaver and set your display to shut off instead.  Turning off the LCD backlight saves a lot more power.
Is it true?  Yes, doing nothing uses less power than doing something.  Displaying nothing uses less power than displaying images, which requires accessing the hard drive to get the images or using the GPU or CPU to generate 2D/3D images.  Turning pixels on and off uses power.  Not a lot, but more than nothing.  Speakers need power.
The same applies to playing sound. Compressed sound files need decoding, which uses CPU time as well.
Saying how much energy you will conserve is however a very difficult task and can't be done with easy methods, as far as I'm concerned.
From your specific comparison, screensaver vs static doc, I'd say you would never see a difference.  Most screensavers won't use much CPU.  Remember that you have a lot of background processes, the screensaver may not use disk, but your word processing app may do background saves. As others have said, you're much better off making your display turn off.  No matter what is displayed on the screen, your backlight is still on.
What difference would you notice between a blank screensaver and just leaving the display on?  Compared to just having the desktop displayed, probably a negligible difference in power consumption.  Beyond that it depends on what application you're running.
If you really care, I'd buy/borrow a Kill-A-Watt. http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/giftsunder20/7657/ Take the battery out of your laptop, run the laptop on mains power.  Compare the two.  I'd doubt if you'd see any difference.  There's too much background noise on a modern OS to compare the two.
Rendering graphics is an intensive task for any CPU, so it will definitely use more battery than just showing a black screen.
