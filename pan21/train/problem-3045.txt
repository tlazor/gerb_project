10.1.1.1 is a significant address on our business network, so that is where I fear this will all break down. My motivation behind all of this is I would like to not have to take my system completely off of our network when I need to do router configuration. Thanks in advance for any help.
Is there a way to keep my primary network connection (to the business network) active, and route specific traffic to the second connection?
I've got two RJ-45 network interfaces built into my motherboard, and the second one is currently of no use to me. I would like to set it up so that I can plug routers into it and then access their configuration pages before attaching them directly to our business network. From what I've read, it seems I need to set up temporary routes via the command prompt when I do this, but if these temporary routes would be overriding routes that are necessary for standard network operation, I suppose I might as well just unplug my primary connection and use it for router configuration.
