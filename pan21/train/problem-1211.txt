There are a lot of ways you could figure out how to do this but it will definitely take quite a bit of scripting and setting up your template properly each time.
I actually wrote a script which will provision machines by renaming and joining them to an AD Domain using Samba and Winbind.
You could also look at hosting the config file on an FTP server and change your dhclient config to grab a newly created DHCP option which will point to said file then use it for the VM configuration.
It will also depend on the Linux distribution you are looking at using.  Currently, my provisioning works in conjunction with Dell vWorkspace and Hyper-V or VMware ESX using Red Hat/CentOS 5.8, 5.8, 6.x and currently finalizing Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04/12.10.
What you need to do though is first generate a Virtual Floppy drive and write a Microsoft unattend.xml file to it.  My provisioning scripts use this file and parse for the computer name, NetBIOS and FQDN domain names, as well as the user/pass to join to the AD Domain.  You could just write a text file to the machine with a list of computer names though and PING for a non-responding host then use that information.
I depend on DHCP for IP addresses but if you had a name/IP pairing in a text file on the Template machine that would work as well.  Start with DHCP but then convert to static IPs.
