I noticed that at the end of your program you had 3 cases due to trying to print the number of cents out correctly.  You can do it all in 1 case by using the %02i format.  This format prints an integer with 2 digit width and pads the leading digits with zeros.
There's still a lot of repetition.  It would be nice to not have to copy/paste one line per denomination.  You can use arrays to handle each denomination in a loop instead.  You just need to create an array with the possible bill denominations and one for the coin denominations.
Since you aren't actually printing out how many of each bill/coin you are using, you don't need so many variables.  You only actually need to know how many bills plus coins you need.  So you could change your code to:
Right now, your logic for each denomination gets more and more complicated as you go along because you are subtracting more and more things from the total on each step.  If you simply subtracted the amount from the total right away, you wouldn't have to repeat it on each step.  For example:
