Cron won't need to wait for task1 to complete before starting task2, but will only start task3 after task1 and task2 are started etc. Once started the tasks will run in parallel (for as long as it takes the tasks to complete.)
It sounds like you're setting up a cron schedule with crontab with many entries with identical schedules in the expectation that cron will execute those in parallel for you.  
In most cron implementations I know the tasks will be started in sequential order, not in parallel, in the order the tasks are listed in the crontab file. Cron will start them one after another...
The tasks that need to be started and the load on the system at the time will limit how fast cron can start new tasks. When cron can't start all tasks in the allotted time interval and the next iteration of your schedule (a new minute) starts, it will forfeit the tasks that couldn't be started. That will result in the error:  
Please note that when your parallel tasks don't finish within a single minute, the next minute 50 additional runs of your task will start regardless, which, with the additional load of those tasks that are still running, will also be running longer that 1 minute. After some time your system will probably run out of resources and become completely unresponsive.
