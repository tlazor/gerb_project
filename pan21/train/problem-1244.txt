You might consider using the personal archives feature in Exchange 2010 if the user needs to keep a lot of old data around, but there's no reason you can't keep it in his mailbox, just as well.
You could plan for high availability by keeping copies of the database on multiple servers. DAGs in Exchange 2010 totally rock! If the budget isn't available for that, consider moving into the cloud with hosted Exchange (make high availability somebody else's problem to worry about).
As long as you've got the disk space and backup capacity there's not really an issue. Exchange has been able to handle large mailboxes for a long time, and Exchange 2010 does a stellar job.
I'm going to add another consideration to Evan's answer. Users with large mailboxes lead to large databases. The larger the database, the longer the recovery time in the event of a disaster. That's something the boss should be made aware of. How many hours is it going to take to recover a database with 10GB mailboxes?
The only performance problems I've seen with Outlook and large mailboxes relate to large numbers of individual items in folders, but that's more of a count-of-items problem and not a size-of-items problem. The user shouldn't keep 20,000+ items in a single folder and expect it to perform well.
Outlook would be the only place where I'd have any cause for concern, and then only if the user is using an older version (pre-2007). Newer versions of Outlook aren't going to have problems with such a large mailbox (and older versions really won't, either, unless you're doing caching).
