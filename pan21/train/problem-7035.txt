The other process could have a temporary file open or a Port; termination of PuTTY might well close the subroutine but probably not remove any lock on files or ports from subprograms.
Quite possibly what has happened is that PuTTY has spawned a VPN subroutine in order to tunnel, and that process has a problem; it has not returned to PuTTY and so PuTTY is hung.
See this Microsoft Support webpage: "Debug Diagnostics Tool v1.2 is now available" where it describes usage of the DebugDiag tool.
Whatever the problem you can locate the exact point and find out which process is at fault and debug it. If you have a question about the use of those tools feel free to check for and ask a new question.
I call that a "hang" and not a "crash". Crash means that execution continues either returning an error message (nice) or in the case of severe memory corruption there will be a pause (usually short, sometimes somewhat lengthy, rarely a watchdog) and execution will continue with a BSOD or reboot (not nice).
Create the dump but you can analyze it yourself, or after searching all the SE sites for a duplicate question ask us: "How do I work with a .DMP file?".
With a "hang" no amount of time waited will seem to further your progress, though other threads may continue to run normally if your Task Switcher is not affected and can switch to them.
Reading a Microsoft Community webpage about that error titled: "Windows Explorer 7 is not responding - 'apphangb1 explorer.exe' error" it says:
