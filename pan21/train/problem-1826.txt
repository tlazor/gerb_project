A routed interface (if it is indeed a routed interface with "no switchport") on a 3560 isn't actually on a VLAN, it's just a routed interface. If you need two interfaces on this vlan just put both the current routed port in the VLAN as an access port and the second port as a tagged port with vlan 20 in the allowed vlan list, then an SVI with the routed address.
You may also want to look at bridged interfaces (bridge-group, int bri) if your switch supports that. Doesn't do much, but may be what you want in some situations.
Unless you can create some kind of bridged interface, you're basically asking how do I bridge two VLANs... you could pull this off by connecting BOTH ports to the same small switch or hub, but this, is a really bad idea. Why not just put both ports on VLAN 20 or both untagged?
If you want to mix and match (output VLAN 10 tagged with dot1q tag 20 on this port) you can't do it with a switch. Well, the least you'll need in a switch would be a 7600 with the expensive linecards, their name escapes me. It's called vlan remapping IIRC.
Possible solutions: VLAN 10 on port 1, VLAN 10 (access port = untagged) on port 2, VLAN 20 (access port = untagged) on port 3, VLAN 20 (tagged) on port 4.
Connect port 2 to port 3, disable CDP, DTP and spanning tree (or the switch will know what you're doing and disable the port). Tada! You have now connected VLAN 10 to VLAN 20. Adapt this method to suit your situation. Waste 2 ports per "bridge".
