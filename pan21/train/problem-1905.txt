It is, however, a bullet of a different kind -- and it tends to point toward your foot unless appropriately used.  
I'm sitting in front of a table with over a million rows in it.  It has an indexed enum column, along with a number of other indexes, but I'm showing that index below.  Note the cardinality is 2.
Second, if you partition the table as discussed, then every query that does not reference that column in its where clause now has all 7 partitions to deal with (and 7 sets of indexes).  Unless there is something really significant and meaningful about this column that means you'll be interrogating it in most of your where clauses, partitioning on it doesn't seem like a particularly good plan.  
First, all the talk about the optimizer not using low cardinality indexes is overblown.  Its true that the optimizer may not prefer it, and it's true that the optimizer may sometimes choose to disregard it, but I have seen posts suggesting that if more than "x" percent of the rows match an index, it wont be used.  And that's absolutely not true.
Yes, it does.  It uses the index for rows that match, and it also uses the index to almost immediately tell me that no rows match if I used a value in the where clause that is not found anywhere in the table in that column.
