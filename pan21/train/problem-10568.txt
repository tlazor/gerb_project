The minimum system requirements for Windows 7 state that 16GB of hard drive space is needed for 32-bit versions and 20GB for 64-bit versions.  Since one generally runs Internet Explorer in 32-bit even on 64-bit systems, you probably want to go with 32-bit, and thus have at least 20GB so you have a little breathing room for the cache, any downloading you might do, plugins or extensions you might install, to update Internet Explorer to version 9, and any operating system updates that will be necessary.
I want to install IE9 on Windows 7 in a VMWare VM. I'd like the VM to use the smallest possible amount of disk space. What's the best way to optimize this VM without losing features from IE9?
That being said, VMware generally uses sparse disk images (unless you specifically disable them), which means regardless of how large you make the virtual disk image, it will only take up the space on your hard drive that you're actually using.  So there's no reason not to be generous.
With ievms you can automatically install a set of VirtualBox VMs from Microsoft. The IE9 one is 13GB (criminally large IMHO).
