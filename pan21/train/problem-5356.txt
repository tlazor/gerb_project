With regards to math, I'm also a little shaky on my foundations. A good resource for these general subject areas is Khan Academy.
Real-time Rendering by Tomas Moller and Eric Haines for a similarly in-depth treatment of rendering.
Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory (Naughty Dog) for general game engine overview at a reasonably detailed level.
http://www.courseptr.com/Courses.aspx?MenuId=8&MenuSubId=0 - they're the publishers of the Game Programming Gems series.
Have you looked at Game Programming Gems series?  It might give you the specifics you seem to be asking for.  There are not many books out on HTML5/canvas as it is quite new, especially ones talking about game programming.
Real-time Collision Detection by Christer Ericson (God of War) for an in-depth and comprehensive overview of collision detection systems.
You're probably at the stage where you'll get the most information by looking at various tutorial postings for specific engines online. There's also a decent enough number of open source games you can check out.
What aspect of game programming are you curious about? There's quite a few books that discuss specific aspects of game programming. Getting a game up and running is not difficult, and any game logic is just like how you'd manage data for any other application, perhaps a little more concerned with speed of execution. Getting into stuff like graphics programming though, can be something else entirely. Start with a basic framework of a game, then focus on one area you're interested in, like designing a robust combat system, or synchronizing animation, or shaders.
