Considering, the fact that i'm still a semi-beginner in the whole programming world go easy on me if i had made any terrible mistakes, just trying to help out.
The point of this separation is to make the code more flexible for example, what if you had to read four files and search how much a certain character would occur in all of them, this way you can instance them all and count easily. Flexibility is key IMO. 
Essentially what is recommended in every situation to do is to split your code into functions where each function does its own part.
I've split up your code into a readFile() function which reads the entire .txt file and converts it to a string and essentially does all the heavy lifting, and a count() function which counts the char you want it to count.
I recommend you pass the path of a file into count(String filePath) method. The reason is we can use a single instance of CountLetter to count different files. Secondly, we shouldn't ask api consumers Path here as their code will be decoupled to our implementation of opening files. By doing that, you could switch to another way of reading files as you please and these changes doesn't break the clients' code.
