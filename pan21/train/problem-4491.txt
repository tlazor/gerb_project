If your variable public GameObject coins contains game objects of type Coin, and that Start is called when the object is instantiated, you have an infinite loop of creation of objects because Start will call instantiate, which will have Start called on the newly created object, which call instantiate, which will have Start called on the newly created object, which call instantiate, which will have Start called on the newly created object, which call instantiate, which will have Start called on the newly created object, which call instantiate, which will have Start called on the newly created object, which call instantiate, which will have Start called on the newly created object, which call instantiate, which will have[...]. 
Maybe you could put the call to instantiate in collisionWithPlayer instead, just before calling Object.Destroy(coins);, like such:
I have an problem where I instantiate a GameObject and it keeps on instantiating a million times over, even though I put the line of code under the start function. 
Now I wouldn't say this is the way to do it (as I said, I'm not an expert with Unity), but this could probably do what you need. 
I am trying to have the player collide with the coin(then a point is added to your score) , then the coin deletes itself and then re-instantiates at a random coordinate, but I cant get past the initial instantiation.
