You can also google for methods of automating firewall rules to block sites, but that won't help your bandwidth if that's an issue, since the requests still make it to your server.
I'd suggest you make sure you triple check that the latest updates are in place for Wordpress. It's like a magnet for hacks.
I have a website. Somebody is sending thousands of 404 hits to my site. He uses random IPs. he is keep on sending at least 1000+ hits everyday to various urls which doesn't exists in my site. I have been getting thousands of 404 hits every day. Kindly guide me on how to handle this issue.
If it's actually affecting your bandwidth talk to your provider about blocking out particular sites. You need to decide if it's worth blocking regions or just trying to limit certain kinds of requests; assuming you have a business account (which you should for hosting) they will need to block it farther upstream in order to prevent your connection from getting overwhelmed.
Ignore it.  Your webserver sending a 404 is not a problem. 1000s of times a day are not many.  Unless this is causing some secondary problem, just ignore it and move on.
Is it actually affecting the performance of your website? If it's just an annoyance in the logs, install fail2ban and configure it so that after X bad requests the IP is automatically banned. Soon you'll have a number of IP's banned and blocked.
