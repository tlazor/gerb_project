IBM TAM has a component which interfaces the application sending customised parameters which could include access level too.
Web seal integration to AD and applications are commonly used for Intra/Extranet users. It is possible to extend this to Internet users too, by creating AD accounts via batch, but I personally wouldn't recommend it. For example, imagine if your AD gets compromised. You would have a much bigger trouble than "only" unauthorized people breaking into a single application.
Another pro for AD is the user maintenance, SoD (from an application level - Imagine if you have two systems, one for sales and another for payments), single password and so on...
Biding your applications to your AD can be done by using a single sign on solution (Web seal) such as (among several others) IBM Tivoli Access Management. This requires you to create the objects accounts (users, systems and computers), set the permissions through groups, implement the web seal login and an authentication interface for every single target application.
