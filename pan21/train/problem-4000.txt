Generally, LACP trunks are safer to use. You should only use static trunks when LACP isn't available.
Of course, the combination of LACP and STP calls for a better integrated solution that even works with multiple switches and meshed setups. This is what Shortest Path Bridging aka IEEE 802.1aq is for. Sadly it hasn't caught on in the mid-range class yet.
In contrast, in a static trunk the links are aggregated when they're up. The switch doesn't check whether the trunk makes sense. You could use links terminated differently and you'd get weird and possibly unexpected effects.
From a functional point of view, there's no difference between LACP trunks and static trunks. All links are aggregated (with the limitations Ron has already pointed out) and the aggregation group is redundant. An LACP trunk set up with eight ports works with anything between one to eight physical links - so does a static trunk.
The difference is that an LACP trunk only works when both sides negotiate the aggregation. Without successful negotiation the physical links fall apart into separate logical links. Usually, it's combined with a spanning tree protocol to avoid bridge loops - without STP the bridge loop would bring down the network.
