I have prepared a guide for setting up SSH/SFTP server on Windows using this Microsoft build of OpenSSH.
Bitvise SSH Server is a great product.  Free for personal use but I have a paid license for commercial use.  With their SSH Client, you can set up SOCKS forwarding while you are on the road to direct web and mail traffic through your server.  Supports port tunnels, remote desktop, SFTP and virtual users with an easy to configure GUI.
I use OpenSSH.  It does use parts form cygwin, but it installes what it needs & it's much smaller than a full cywin install.  It's fairly easy to set it up as a service on Windows (XP at least)  - no experience running it on Vista or Windows 7.
I was wondering what people use as an SSHd server on Windows? I've decided that I want to be able to log in using SSH on my Windows computers but I don't want to use Linux full-time. What are my options, besides Cygwin (which I know of)? I've looked into some other server software but I don't know which are reliable and it's not easy to find reviews of some of them. Thanks!
