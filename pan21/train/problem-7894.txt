P.S.: https://wiki.apache.org/httpd/RunningMultipleApacheInstances seems like a good starting point to explore further.
The first one checks the configuration and start your new instance. If it doesn't work, do the usual Apache debugging to get it working.
The apache wiki at wiki.apache.org has the answer for me. My main concern was not clobbering files in my current version of apache2 when creating a new apache2, and I had not seen a configuration option before to control where apache2ctl is copied to. However, it's there, and this page leads me to believe that all apache2 files are accounted for and that config.layout allows one to direct where all of them go. http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/DistrosDefaultLayout#Apache_httpd_2.2_default_layout_.28apache.org_source_package.29:
With Apache 2.4 you can also have different MPMs installed at the same time so you can use different ones in your instances, which is your requirement.
Now edit your new configuration in /etc/apache2-DRUPAL. You can change the web server username in /etc/apache2-DRUPAL/envvars, listening ports in /etc/apache2-DRUPAL/ports.conf etc.
If you wan't to run Apache commands without going through /etc/init.d/apache2-DRUPAL, you have to run . /etc/apache2-DRUPAL/envvars before running them. I think this is Debian/Ubuntu specific. When you do that, you'll notice that apache2ctl, apache2 -S and others are operating from your new configuration.
