The spaces are meaningful for your content. Currently you only make it readable by using CSS, but not all user agents support CSS (text browsers, bots, feed readers, etc.).
As the links point to an external site (unless you want to publish this list on that site), you could use the external link type:
But if your desired design isn’t possible with a table, using ul is fine. In that case you might want to provide title attributes that explain the value (not a perfect solution, but better than nothing):
The images you show would probably get the card name as alt content (unless you want to describe what the image contains/shows, but in that case they should probably be bigger), but as this would be redundant, you should provide empty values.

Instead of a ul element, a table element would be more appropriate for the kind of content. This would also allow you to provide labels for the different values (e.g., card costs and card counts).
