After ten years of this problem driving me nuts as well I have finally found a solution that works for me. Unfortunately it is not free... Actual Window Manager has a feature called "Ignore deactivation" which can be enabled for specific apps. This makes the window think it still has focus even when it doesn't. I have this turned on for all office apps and now I can still see the highlighted selection even when another window has focus. I have not had any negative side effects either. I also use multiple monitors and this program has a ton of other useful tools for working with multiple monitors as well that made it worthwhile for me. I installed the trial and then uninstalled it and it offered me 30% off. There may be a free program that does this but I couldn't find one... I hope this helps someone as much as it helped me!
A downside to this, is that the text are only marked, as long as you hold the cells copied. Meaning you can't copy anything else or the marking is gone. Unfortunately this will not work from Word to Excel.
A quick way to fix half of your problem (when switching from Excel to Word) is to copy the text. When you hit Ctrl + c the cells will continue to be marked (the highligthing is gone, but you still have a dotted line around the text).
This seems to be an exclusive Microsoft "feature". For most projects I only need read-only access and formatting doesn't matter in my case, therefore I have switched to OpenOffice which does not exhibit this behavior.
