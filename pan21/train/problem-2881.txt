Is there such a thing (presumably as an extension) out there somewhere? If not, what should I be looking for to program such a thing — can something be done with an extension, and where would I find the relevant documentation?

In Thunderbird, when I'm composing a mail, I would like some visual feedback regarding who I'm sending email to, in broad terms. A typical use case is to clearly distinguish whether my mail is being sent only inside my organization or not.
