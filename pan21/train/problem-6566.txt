I've noticed that whichever Pi I connect first to the PC works. The second connected doesn't (simple pinging provides me with the information). Next I have no problem connecting either of my Pi-s to my notebook - one provides me with Internet access (as expected; I turn off the WiFi adapter on the notebook for this) and the other with a "normal" Ethernet connection. I can also SSH from one machine to the other if connected (except for the case when the problem described above occurs).
Raspberry Pi 3 the latest Rasbian and static IP address 192.168.1.2. There is a bridge between its WiFi interface and its Ethernet interface so that my PC can connect the Ethernet port (the interface of the PC is set to Automatic (DHCP)) and be able to access the Internet. I used this tutorial for the setup.
I'm not that network savvy so some hints on what I'm doing wrong would be appreciated. If I can provide more information please do tell.
The problem I'm having is that I seem to be unable to use both the Pis connected to the PC even though they are attached to different network cards and their IP addresses are different but part of the same network. The automatic DCHP on the Pi 3 currently has given my PC (the interface it is connected to) the IP address 192.168.1.119.
