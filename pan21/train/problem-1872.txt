You didn't state which Windows version is your AD based on, but it probably is 2003; I'd recommend an upgrade to 2008 (lots of new and improved GPOs, also).
For 2), the Desired Configuration Management feature of System Center Configuration Manager is exactly what you're looking for.  It also gives you a more flexible way of deploying software to your machines in the first place (like the ability to run unattended setup.exe installs instead of only MSI's through group policy).  It's a really great product in general, but it does cost money.
To ensure that Windows machines have the right software/settings at $WORK I have implemented wpkg. It is basically a script that parses xml files where you define what machines should have installed. It works really well and it's open source. I guess it does the same things Systems Configuration Manager does, but it costs you nothing and you can ask the developers to introduce new functionality. It requires some learning on your part though.
For 1) you can live with Windows security logs and some GPOs (if empty passwords are a problem, just require them to be at least X characters long); if your DCs are Windows 2008, you can even have centralized logging, which was unavailable with 2003.
For 2) System Center Configuration Manager is the best answer, if you're sticking with Microsoft solutions; but it sure can be a bit too much for a simple network like yours. Windows 2008 introduced Network Access Protection, which can also be quite useful:
