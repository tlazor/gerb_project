I have 2 routers in my office and my Laptop can connect with wifi to one, but not the other problem wifi. I can connect with other devices to both wifi connections without any problems.
Router and laptop restart, yielded no results. Disabled the wifi and created new wifi password, forgot wifi on laptop and attempted reconnection with same results.
List is created initially by allowing devices then adding all connected devices to the list in bulk after verifying each ssid; then turning on the allow only devices on the list setting.  Subsequent additions are made by adding each ssid individually PRIOR to the device being able to connect.
I see that my laptop does "connects" to the problem wifi only if I type the correct password, but it cannot access the network even though it claims it is connected. Connecting with ethernet cable grants access to the network without any issue.
Perhaps such a list preclusion setting has been activated post your initial devices connecting but prior to your problem device.
