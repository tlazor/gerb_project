The correct solution according to the 802.11 specification is WDS, which permits each wireless packet to have two destination hardware addresses, one of the wireless endpoint and one for the destination Ethernet interface. But without WDS, it can only be faked by violating the specifications.
Generally speaking, Wifi and bridging don't mix well. You can use Internet connection sharing or anything based on routing rather than bridging. Wifi is just enough like Ethernet to make people expect it to be exactly like Ethernet. But it isn't, and this is one of those places where it's really different.
Some routers violate the 802.11 specification in various ways to make things that officially shouldn't work "just work" for the convenience of their customers. But you absolutely can't rely on it.
If the bridge passes the packets through with their original source hardware addresses, the 802.11 specification requires the access point to forward packets destined for only one of those hardware addresses. If the bridge passes through the packets with the same hardware address, it will have no reliable way to know which packets go to the host and which go to the VM.
The problem is this -- the virtual machine and the physical machine have different network hardware addresses. By bridging to the Wifi connection, you present two different hardware addresses to the access point. But the access point only has one wireless client, and that gives it only one slot for a hardware address.
You can't bridge to a WiFi client connection. It is prohibited by the 802.11 specification. If you could, there would be no need to configure WDS in the existing access point when expanding a wireless network -- we could just make a client connection to the access point and bridge to it.
