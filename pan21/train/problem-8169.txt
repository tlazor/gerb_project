The canonical commercial example is Ghost; good open-source alternatives include FOG or  Clonezilla.
Gotcha: DriveImageXML is not able to backup hidden partitions. It also only supports NTFS and FAT file systems.
This method is only suitable for smaller to larger HDD drive upgrades. DriveImageXML will not restore to a drive that is not identical or smaller in size. It is highly suggested that the new drive be larger in all cases
Doing this with DriveImageXML may seem like it has an extra step involved but the process allows you to have a reliable backup during which is important.
Mount the destination drive read-write, then if the origin drive is SDB, run "dd if=/dev/sdb of=/mnt/sda/drivebackup.img".  Or, even better, "dd if=/dev/sdb | gzip -9 > /mnt/sda/drivebackup.img".
Acronis works pretty well for this. They even offer a pluggin for BartPE I think, so you can boot off the BartPe CD and do your clone from there.
(Also useful to know is you can make a bootable DOS USB key with the HP Drive Key Boot Utility.  Never touch a floppy disk again.)
