The OS onthe other hand is typically a higher layer and you do not flash it. You install it. Regardless if you use rotating rust or flash cells to write it to.
In conclusion, flashing means complete replacement of existing data, installing means adding some information to / modifying it.
As far as I know, the term 'flashing' was earlier used for writing ((E)E)PROM chips on which devices store their firmware; depending on the device, there might be an online upgrade function, or one might need to use an actual EEPROM programmer device. (That's also where the term "ROM" comes from, since the chip was effectively read-only after programming it once.)
The deletion happens by putting a current on all cells, reminding of a camera flash. Thus, the term flashing and flash memory was created.
Lets say that you want to change your device's operating system.For a phone or tablet we would say "today I am flashing cyanogenmod" but for PCs "today I am installing Ubuntu" although flash is used BIOS like "I am flashing an updated BIOS to my laptop". Why is it called flash,it is basically the same thing,replacing the operating system.Is this because phones and tablets use SSD / flash memory.But new computers also have SSDs
The main difference from installing is that you have a prepared image, and the firmware upgrade erases and rewrites the whole thing at once. Traditional OS installation, meanwhile, involves a lot of moving parts â€“ copying individual files to an existing filesystem, setting up the configuration on the spot, etc.
In smartphones, one can see a similar behaviour: flashing overwrites the whole stored information, instead of changing small fractions of it.
The firmware is what gets run when the device powers up. Usually from ROM, EEPROM or possibly from flash memory.
It's called like that, because data stored on it cannot simply be 'updated' instead it would have to be deleted and completely rewritten (c.f. block erasure of flash memory on Wikipedia).
