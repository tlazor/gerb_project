Setting conventions in a large market full of established players is hard. Perhaps a job for ISO or IEEE.
I bet they would all agree that there should always be one side that is empty. They just wouldn't agree which side that would be.
But what are you going to do? Call up and complain that a company's cable isn't "real" USB because it's out of spec?  They might give you your money back, but they won't recall all of their cables.
I've found most systems have their USB ports oriented such that when the computer is oriented correctly either upright or horizontally (indicated by the rubber feet usually found on two sides of the computer) and the USB ports are horizontal, the side of the USB device (not the plug in the computer) without the seam (the "empty" side of the device connector) faces up. This would mean the "empty" side of the USB connector inside the computer is normally on the bottom.
While there are not standards (as others have said) and there are certainly exceptions to what I shall now claim:
Add-in cards may not abide by this, and Apple USB connectors seem to have the connector seams on the opposite side from normal, but for the most part, my observation is that 90% or more of USB devices I've worked with have been oriented this way.
Because there is no need for that... It doesn't matter I guess, since I can't think of a device that may have a problem if attached in either sides. So why would they (manufacturers) do that??
