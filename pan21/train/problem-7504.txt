Some people are crazy and block just about everything. Some people do block geographically, but from their point of view this can seem reasonable if they are certain they won't receive email from certain locations (I have my doubts about this but... their email server their rules).
Also the major ESP's all provide support to help you with their deliverability to their customers (Hotmail's is located at http://postmaster.live.com for example.) Those teams can usually setup feedback loops with you so if a customer marks your mail as junk, they'll let you know so you can remove it from your lists.
The different major ESP's use a lot of techniques to determine who to block and rate limit, but as others have mentioned it's usually independent of the geolocation of the IP. The most important thing for mail deliverability is reputation. Things that can impact reputation:
Happened to us, we couldn't reach some US sites from european IPs becaus IANA put to /8 (IIRC) networks out in the wild which had been reserved up to that point in time. The people that ran the site didn't care about the blacklisted IPs and there was no way for us (and a couple of other people) to get to their site...
The thing to worry about with IP addresses if whether or not they have previously spammed. It's possible to get out of the "managed" DNS RBLs (for very small or crazy values of "possible" for some of the more extreme lists) but if a previous user of that address spammed from it and a bunch of sysadmins dropped the address into their local router's deny table then good luck with that one, I'm afraid.
There are 3rd party tools like http://senderbase.org that you can use to help determine what kind of reputation your IP's have.
The question is, do they want you to reach them. Your US IP address might help you reach people inside the US but there are no guarantees and probably no addresses that aren't blocked by someone somewhere.
