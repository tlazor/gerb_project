What is the best solution to this? I have heard and read up on Docker and Vagrant - is what I am describing something both Docker and Vagrant are designed to address? I see there are libraries of boxes for both, but I don't see anything as simple as 'php7 LAMP' for example. The environments XAMPP provide are spot on, other than not being able to switch between them for different sites.
Rather than using dedicated virtual machines, I strongly suggest you to use php-fpm and (if using apache 2.4 as webserver) mod_proxy_fcgi
With it, you basically create/configure a pool of php-ready threads, with each pool potentially running a different php version (eg: 5.4, 5.6, 7.x). In turn, the webserver used the FastCGI protocol to talk to these pools.
We've always used XAMPP for local development - upgrading to php7 wasn't particularly easy, and was time consuming - something I'd like us to avoid in the future. It also means, as far as I understand, we can't run apache with 5.6 and then switch to php7 and vice-versa - at least not without some complex and potentially troublesome config changes which would need to be replicated on each machine.
There is almost no difference in performance in case your computers are less 5 years old and equipped with fast drives (like SSD)
We have numerous sites, some of which have live environments with php7, but the majority 5.6. Going forward, we want all sites to be deployed onto a server running php7.
I am looking for a way for our team to be able to have both a php 5.6 environment and a php7 environment on our local machines for development.
