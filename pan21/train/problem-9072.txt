I'd recommend Handbrake for this. It's free, open source and cross platform. And very easy to use. It also supports converting to an iPod-friendly format.
Personally I don't like to have the menu's and everything else on the dvd. Only the movie, and I also compress it with a good codec (You can go to half the size of a dvd without losing any quality like @jerryjvl mentioned in his answer!).
Another freeware tool I've been using successfully for this is DVDx. Also good but somewhat less user-friendly.
If you really need the original dvd with menu and everything, then I think a simple ISO creation tool will do the job (MagicISO, or any CD/DVD writer soft can do that).
DVD Shrink will allow you to rip just the main movie from your DVDs. It will also allow you to "splice" two part movies together via reauthoring (think disc 1 and 2 of Lord of the Rings extended edition).
Once you have the ISOs, VLC can play ISOs directly, and with some finagling that Google could help out with you can convert those into any format at a later time, such as for your iPod, again, using VLC.
AnyDVD will bypass the copyright, and you can easily use it to copy the entire content to your HD as is (As far as I know).
