You plugged a second floppy drive into it and it allegedly enabled the user to copy copy-protected games from DF0: to DF1: by duplicating byte-for-byte. I'm not sure it was ever that successful in reality though.
Rainbow Sentinel Pro and KeyLok were Parallel Port Key dongles I worked with in the 80's.  I think there was one called DESLock too but it was a long time ago.  These all required you to communicate to them using some sample code provided by the dongle provider (in my case it was some C code which was compiled to .OBJ and linked into a Clipper application).
I used one of these in the 90s on simulation software.  The manufacturer was one of the hot-shot crypto companies (don't remember the name).  The software would query the dongle once in a while and, if the response was accepted, the software would continue running normally.  If the dongle was missing or didn't respond in time, the software would, IIRC, stop or switch to demo mode (deliberately crippled).  A line printer could be hooked up to the dongle.
I've got something identical to this knocking about somewhere, but it was for, ahem, circumventing copyright protection back in the day. It worked with software called Synchro Express (version 2 point Zero, Copyright Coast To Coast Technology, All Rights Reserved) on the Amiga.
