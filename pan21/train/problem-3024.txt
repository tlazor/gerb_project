I'd just install TrueCrypt, install all your programs to that volume and place all your documents in there as well. Place it under C:\ or something and all you will see is 1 big file. Rename it whatever you want, I highly doubt this person will notice anything out of the ordinary. It's not like they will crack the encryption if they do find it, although they could delete it. That's also why I'd suggest keeping a second copy of the volume elsewhere.
Rather than hiding them, I'd suggest storing your files onto an encrypted volume using TrueCrypt. Most software that "hides" folders and files only make them invisible when browsing through explorer. You can easily use Windows' search feature which will find things in these "hidden" folders.
true crypt can be run in portable mode from a USB key as well. the instructions are in the documentation.
You would have the true crypt program on a USB key, and your file container on your hard drive. you can name the file container anything you like (mine is cabinet.bak). There is also a feature to keep the file container hidden.
