We are currently developing a system with MEAN stack with Mongodb at backend. We have employees name, and Ids in our system and our client wants to get pretty good (Read: Google Like) search in our system to search for employees' records. He needs our system to recommend employees even if he has misspelled the name, etc.
One of the suggestions from our development lead was that we should use elastic search but from what I have seen, elastic search is preferred especially in scenarios where we are searching in a large text documents. I am having a feeling that using elastic search in our case will only increase the overhead as the attributes getting search in our case just names, emails or ids, etc. 
So, I wanted some guidance (Suggestions) on whether to move towards elastic search or should we stick with our current resources to work on a more optimized search than what we have right now?
Currently, our system only uses some basic regrex but I believe, we can improve our search by putting in some effort and without moving towards elastic search (though the development lead feels that we will only be Reinventing the wheel and we should use technologies that do this stuff for us.)
