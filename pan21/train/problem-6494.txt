this would tell you if the traffic to your machine is going through the vpn. Also, when adding routes, try this:
I'm trying to get a remote desktop connection over VPN to work. The VPN connection authenticates fine, and the (Microsoft) RDC client gives an error about the machine being unavailable. The kicker is this was previously working for a day, only after I mucked about with the routing table for a few hours. (This is on a Mac, so it wasn't perhaps as seamless as Windows may be on this occasion)
you may have to adjust the network address and network mask so that all IP address you need to access go through the vpn, something the IT dept that maintains the VPN should be able to help you with, but the above should at least get you connecting to your one machine.
To explain, when researching my initial problem I came across this forum post, which answered a similar question - by manually adding routing entries. Essentially, the solution provided was:
This didn't work right off the bat, but I kept throwing numbers at it, and it eventually worked. You may have gathered that, although I have a rough understanding of gateways, I'm unfamiliar with mucking about with router tables. And I'm unsure why it started working, and why it stopped...
Ping can resolve DNS names of machines on the company network fine (e.g. machine01.company.local -> 171.17.2.175), but doesn't return the ping. Nor does a ping to my IP, or the router.
Don't know the structure of a route add in *nix, but... shouldn't be there the netmask of the destination? In Windows, thing is something like:
