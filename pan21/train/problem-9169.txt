Like Tomasz and Zoredache said: the script Microsoft provides can only be used to set the local account passwords on remote machines to random passwords. The account passwords stored in the CSV file can be encrypted using a password of the administrators choosing (the parameter -EncryptionKey) to ensure clear-text account passwords aren't written to disk.
We use the following script to decrypt the password from the password file and use this to set the Administrator password (I stripped the error handling and logging):
We use the following script (I stripped out the error logging and try/catches) to create a password file:
In our environment we also would like to change the password regularly, so we created two scripts: one to create a new file with an encrypted password (of our own choosing) and distributed this file to all of our workstations. A seconds script (distributed also to the workstations) runs every X hours and resets the password based on the contents of the file. Of course the password used to encrypt and decrypt is still stored in plain text, but the password itself isn't. This way you really need to know what you are doing to retrieve the Local Admin password en because the encryption file and script are saved in different locations it is pretty safe. 
The encrypted passwords (stored in the TSV file) can be decrypted using another function in the same file: ConvertTo-CleartextPassword.
