I had the same problem with my kernel version not being supported.  In August of 2019, the kernel-5.0.0 on my Ubuntu-18.04.2 was not accepted.  To compare what Amazon's AMIs were using, I launched their Ubuntu-18.04.2 and found that it was using kernel-4.4.0.  So I ended up using an Lubuntu-16.04.3.VMDK that I had locally with kernel-4.10.0-28-generic, converted it to .OVA (OVF version 2.0) using VirtualBox, uploaded it to S3, and was able to successfully get it to import to .AMI using the "aws ec2 import-image" command.  So based on my tests, it seems that as of now, AWS is accepting kernel-4, but not kernel-5. Hope this helps!
For those looking for solution, you can use ec2-bundle-image which is included in ec2-ami-tools. Here is some recipe:
After much trying, I finally could upload an Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS LTS machine from Virtualbox with the 3.13.0-031300-generic kernel that you can get here
I have a stock image of Ubuntu Server 16.04 exported as an OVA from VirtualBox.  After the proper permissions are set up to import that OVA into AWS EC2 as an image, and it's loaded into S3, the process haults during the import with a status of:

My first reaction is to search the AWS documentation for what kernel versions they WOULD accept.  That eludes me.
