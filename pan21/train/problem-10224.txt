I suspect overheating, so I downloaded HWMonitor to watch the temperature and fan speeds. The temperature rises for both CPU and graphics card, and the fans increase in RPM, but I can't hear any fans turning on. It's completely silent. I suspect the fans simply don't turn on, even though the software side seems to think it does. Interestingly, I can hear the fans turn on at seemingly random times during heavy load usage, so I know I should be able to hear something. Unsure if it's the graphics card, the CPU cooling or both turning on though.
My computer is a bit of a Frankenstein as I bought it in parts around 2009 and have upgraded bits and pieces at a time. The oldest parts are the motherboard and the CPU, everything else has been upgraded (PSU, cooling, case, storage units, video card, memory, peripherals). Could this be a sign of my motherboard giving up?
I use my computer mainly for gaming, and recently I've been having issues with various games crashing. I suspected my video card as I got errors of the kind "Your rendering device has been lost" in Overwatch and plain freezing in Witcher 3. I reverted to older graphics card drivers, and now the computer shuts down instead of crashing individual applications. No BSOD or helpful logs are generated.
