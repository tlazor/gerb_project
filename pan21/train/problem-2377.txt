While connected to a VPN, I have to use a proxy to connect to the internet. Normally the proxy config file is located in an online location, and the web browser LAN settings is pointed to that. I wanted to make a few modifications to make things more efficient, and so I downloaded the .pac. However, when I point Internet Explorer to the identical local copy, the proxy no longer works. The local copy works perfectly with Chrome. What could be causing this?
I discovered the problem was that I needed to add the file:// protocol before the path to the pac file, and to replace the backslashes in the path with forward slashes. I use Chrome myself, and it is intelligent enough not to need that, so I was unaware that Internet Explorer required it.
Also, don't forget that the pac file is actually a JavaScript subset so you can use alert() to raise alert messages to see what is actually happening as the file is processed.
Perhaps the VPN login is enforcing a Group Policy setting? When logged in on the VPN, can you check the proxy settings?
