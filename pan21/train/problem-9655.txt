Another place to look in WSUS is which products you are checking for updates to make sure you aren't seeing updates for products you don't even have in your environment.  As far as I know, there is no way to avoid seeing the updates for the Itanium processors though which sucks.
I suggest that you decline (not just disapprove) updates that you know you will not use or need. Superseded updates are part of this. Keeping a clean WSUS installation is fairly important for performance.
It doesn't really matter. When you run the WSUS cleanup wizard from the management console, it should get rid of anything that's been superseded anyway. It's not going to harm anything by declining them, but you could just as well run that tool every couple of months to tidy up the DB anyway.
Not damaging but probably useless.  WSUS doesn't actually download them until you approve them so there is no harm in leaving them there.  Disapproving them takes them out of your view, which has its own benefits when looking for new updates to approve so yes you can disapprove them.
