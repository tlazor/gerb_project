One big clue here is that your computer is slowing down a lot, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.  Does your RAID array seem to start rebuilding before the OS boots, or after?  If after, then it's very likely that you have one of those software RAID controllers I mentioned [in the first paragraph].
I had a client that had similar problems.  We all thought it was the raid card so replaced it with another.  2 more cards later and we came to the conclusion it was the computer.
If you have multiple ram sticks, how about removing some of them and move them around and see if you get the same problem.  e.g. (4GB RAM) 2x 2GB sticks.  Remove the top one. Run the machine for a while on 2GB and see if the problem is still there.  If it is, swap the ram stick with the other one and leave one out.  Same problem?  might not be the ram, problem goes away? hmmm interesting... could be a ram issue.
When he replaced the computer and used one of the "what we thought was" faulty raid card and the problem never resurfaced.
If your RAID controller is one of those lower-cost models that doesn't do its own processing but relies on the driver to do all the hard work (many lower-end motherboards with integrated RAID controllers have these types of controllers), and Windows is crashing while the disk is being updated (or all the updates haven't been written to the disks prior to the reboot operation), then this could be the cause of your problem.
In the end, we never really narrowed down exactly where the problem was.  It could have been ram, motherboard or CPU, who knows.  But since he replaced the whole box and was able to re-use the raid controller & hard drive we isolated enough to know it wasn't software, or hard disk or raid controller.
