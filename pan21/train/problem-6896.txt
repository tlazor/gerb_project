No. This will replace whatever was stored under /home with the contents of the newly mounted filesystem.  
Compare it to having a book. sdb is the book. sdb1 are the pages for the first story in that book. And most books only have one story, in which case it is almost the same.
Yes. The first partition on that disk will be mounted at boot under /home. That assumes that you created an ext4 filessystem on that partition though.
Back to the book analogy: The filesystem is like actually writing the page numbers rather than having blank paper.
What will happen if I never assign a partition to be mounted on directories like /opt, /tmp, /usr... Where do they get disk space from?
/dev/sdb1 is the first partition on that drive. If you only have one partition then it is usually as large as the whole drive.
What you probably want to do is reboot into single user mode, then move the contents from /home to another location. (e.g. mv /home /home.old). Then mount the new disk in its old space (mkdir /home, mount /home) and make sure all old files and their permissions are then copied to the new disk.
