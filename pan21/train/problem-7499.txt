You can have a back-end storage server (or use one of the web servers) and share the data directory to the other server via NFS, which is supported on 2008R2. This should take care of your concurrency issues and make the storage appear local to the servers.
What you can do, is use the SAN as a shared SCSI drive, so that the drive shows up as D: on both machines, but only one of them can use it at the same time. You won't get load balancing that way, but you do get the redundancy - if the other VM fails, you can swap over to the other one and it will take over the drive and continue.
As previously stated, the same storage cannot be actively used in two places. This is why you would usually have a database backend handling the data for this kind of application, so that you can have several clients concurrently accessing it.
In short, what you are trying to do will not work, I am not sure whether or not VMWare can use the shared folder as a disk, but what I do know is that 2 Virtual Servers cannot share the same disk and access it at the same time for the same reason that almost no other application can, both machines cannot write to the same disk at the same time. Basically VMWare would throw an error when you tried to start the second server telling you the disk file was locked.
