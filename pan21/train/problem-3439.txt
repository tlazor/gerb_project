I want to eliminate that possibility or ask to be asked a password when I tried to boot a computer that way.
Sorry for not having the correct wording, I am not in front of the BIOS (obviously). This accomplishes BIOS
It can be done. The only reason I know this is because I just purchased a used computer. The woman who had this computer knew her stuff. I am using a guest account currently on the computer. Her boot, bios, and command prompt settings are locked down. I can access command prompt in safe mode and monitor the majority of the profile information. However, if I attempt to change anything it just tells me denied. I have two programs that can get around her passwords but one will have to access the boot menu to load. This will not work. the only other option I have is to force her bios password with another program, if I can get that to work even. This woman went through a lot of trouble just to protect this computer. 
I do not want the computer to ask a password when it boots normally to Windows, but only if someone tries to access the boot menu.
You can try assigning a BIOS / administration password as the boot menu may be covered by that, however, if this doesn't work and you do not want a boot password, I do not think there will be any way to achieve what you want.
On most computers we can press a key, in my case F12, to access the boot menu where we can choose to boot from another drive, such as the CD or another HD.
