In order to get data back where there is suspected physical damage the drive should be opened by a professional in a clean room and inspected or repaired. If you don't it's like driving on a busted tire off the road to a gas station. By the time you get there you will need to replace the rim also. In this case, you will only end up killing the drive in the process of running your cloning utility which more than likely will give you an incomplete corrupt clone anyways.
Probably a problem here: How do you define damaged? 99% of the time if a drive has experienced any loss of altitude before suddenly finding itself stationary on a hard surface there is almost guaranteed to be damage inside to the moving parts.
ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM. Basically what you are trying to do here is a crash and burn and hopefully get some data off the drive in the process. BEFORE you do this the RIGHT thing to d o is repair the DAMAGED parts inside the drive to preserve the condition of the platters ie. YOUR DATA. (read about dangers of using DIY recovery software)
HUGE PROBLEM here. I am wondering what you are hoping to accomplish by performing a "trick" here. And how freezing a drive with damaged inner parts will help them become undamaged.
