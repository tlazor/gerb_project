In older Versions of Word I could open each Document in an independant process of Word by just starting another instance of the application and then opening the document. Each Word Process did not interfere with the others so that they all could work simultaneously.
I try to open multiple Copies of a Mailmerge Document (all in different folders and named differently), to speed up the process of creating the letters to round about 10k recipients. The documents are automatically created and printed using VBA. 
Since MS Word 2007 there seems to be a change in how Documents are opened. In older Versions, each Document could be opened in a completely independant Word Window. Now, all seem to be opened in one single Process, which is currently not the desired behaviour.
Now I don't find a way to run them separately. If I do an Apllication.Visible = False in one of them, all Documents become invisible. I can't start more than one macro as it's not possible to run multiple macros in the same instance of Word.
