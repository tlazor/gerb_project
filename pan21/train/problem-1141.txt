I've have seen programs like virus scanners and file backup programs that slow things down tremendously without major CPU usage; especially on restart.  If it happened 2 months ago, what software changed 2 months ago?  Try to identify the program and either eliminate it, optimize its settings, or get rid of it and find an alternative.  Or, try to roll back to a system restore from 2 months ago to before when it was faster, then incrementally move forward with programs and MS updates.
From a command prompt: chkdsk c: /f, reboot, and let it run.  If it reports bad sectors then your drive is dying.
I would run a Hard Drive diagnostic, either http://www.hgst.com/hdd/support/downloads/dft32_v416_b00.iso or http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/item/seatools-dos-master/ and burn it to a disc and check.  If the hard drive is running good, try using msconfig to remove unnecessary startup items.  Too many items running can hurt performance.  If all  fails, consider upgrading your hard drive to an SSD for the OS and store other items on a different hard drive.  That was single handedly the best upgrade I've ever made on a computer for performance.
