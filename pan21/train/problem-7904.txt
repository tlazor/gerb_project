Once you have a good grasp on the goals of a good segregation of dev, test, and ops environments and "separation of duties" you will likely recognize that the technical problems are not that hard. They sure don't sound hard for what you have described.
Enable 'Object Access' auditing in the servers 'Advanced Security Audit Policy Settings' then apply Full Auditing on the folder structure you're monitoring. This will log in the Windows Security Event log.
There are many ways to track file movement between systems and environments. However, this is not really a technology product situation. This is a business process and information security situation. Even if you buy a really expensive DLP, you need the policies, processes, and audits to make it meaningful. (See my closing note.)
An initial response of "let's buy something to satisfy an audit requirement" is almost always a long term business or security FAIL. It drives the compliance part of the IT industry, but it won't help you much with actual security and will probably cost you more in the long run.
Rather than waste a bunch of time and money researching shiny things to spend money on, I suggest you check out the Information Security Stack Exchange site to get more guidance on this topic.
You wouldn't be able to track a file from one server to another, but with Windows auditing you can see the access action on the source server and the creation action on the destination server.
