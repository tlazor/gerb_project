Downgrading Debian version is not supported. If you specifically need Debian 6, I would advise a re-install.
In apt cache configuration you can also set different path maps to map a URL to a different upstream server. For instance if you wanted to use archive.debian.org for Debian Lenny for instance which has been removed from the main Debian repo's.
As for if you have broken your Debian 6 server then it depends on the applications running there and if they are compatible with Debian 7. It should be safe to check the Release notes for Debian 7 and just follow the upgrade procedure to ensure you properly complete the process.
path_map = debian ftp.uk.debian.org/debian ; security security.debian.org/debian-security ; archive archive.debian.org/debian ; volatile volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile ; backports backports.debian.org/debian-backports ; archive-backports archive.debian.org/debian-backports ; archive-security archive.debian.org/debian-security
The repositories upstream are shared, it's only the addition of the  name that affects the package set that will be used.
