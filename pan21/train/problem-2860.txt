To troubleshoot, I simply extracted the archive and remade the archive without making any changes, and Powerpoint still could not open the file.
At this point I decided to try to edit the XML files. I found the slides where Titillium is present when searching the XML files. I replaced them all with Arial and saved the files, but when I opened them again, they reverted back to Titillium.

When I then tried to extract the files, I made the changes, converted into an archive, and changed the file extension to *pptx. Powerpoint could then not open the file, it was corrupted.

When I go to save the files, it tells me that font "Titillium" cannot be embedded. I do not use Titillium in the slides - I imagine it was what the template owner used. I have done the following to try to remove or replace the font:
