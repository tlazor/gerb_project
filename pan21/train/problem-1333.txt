I just changed the Speed of the gigabit NIC from Auto negotiation or auto detect to 1Gbps or 1000 and then it worked.. i get 120megs / sec of transfer rate.. but when ive set back to auto negotiation or auto detect on both NIC again.. (so i check if this was really the problem) it still worked at 120megs / sec.
If your network isn't saturating then your machines are probably not fast enough somewhere else. Your machines' performance may be limited by the ability of your computers to read/write data to/from your disk. Try running something like HDTune to see how fast your HDD can write data. 
It is command line tool that is executed on both systems and it tests your maximum network throughput on raw TCP level.
Also consider copying the file(s) in question to your target machine and then try making a duplicate copy of the file(s) on the target HDD to test its real-world performance.
You should test your network throughput independently of the rest. Just perform a test via NetIO (platforms: OS/2 2.x, Windows, Linux and Unix) and you know if your problem is the network or not. 
My bet is that your cables are not Gigabit cables and so at least one of the network interfaces is running at 100Mbps. Not only is category 5 technically not capable of Gigabit speeds (though it usually works) but Gigabit cables require all 8 lines to be connected, not just 4 like fast Ethernet.
