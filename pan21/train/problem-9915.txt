You could announce the /8 and the /24 from two different interfaces and this would shove the traffic that wasn't in the /24 into one path and the /24 to another.
David, depending on your setup this might work and is a known way of directing traffic to the most-specific prefix.
However if you have addresses in 10.0.0.0/8 that spill over in 10.0.1.0/24 range then they can't communicate. 
The hosts in 10.0.1.0/24 will not be able to communicate with any other hosts in any other subnets of 10.0.0.0/8 without a default-gateway.
The short answer is that the two subnets will not be able to communicate.  The 10.0.0.0/8 subnet will believe that the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet is local.  Thus, traffic from 10.0.0.0/8 to 10.0.1.0/24 will never be routed (it will stay local).  Traffic from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.0.0/8 will be routed to the default gateway.  This traffic will make to the desired host in the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet; however, return traffic (required for TCP) will not be returned.  In theory, UDP from 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.0.0/8 will be successful.  However, if there is any requirement at the application level for acknowledgements (TFTP, etc.), the application will fail.
The hosts in 10.0.0.0/8 will be able to communicate with all hosts in 10.0.0.0/8, which includes 10.0.1.0/24, but only one-way if the hosts in 10.0.1.0/24 do not have a default-gateway with access to both subnets.
