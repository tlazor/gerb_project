Another matter to make note of is the fact that channel changes reset to default upon each reboot of the RPi. So in order to keep those changes on your RPi, I would suggest writing a shell script in the root directory and calling it in crontab upon reboot. I did so by 
Reporting in from the future - (where the raspian kernel is 4.9) I can tell that sudo raspi-config now offers a option Set wifi country under localization. From there you can set a locale that enables the channel 12 and 13.
My commendations to all.  This will get me to a path I'm looking for.  AC - tables along with the b-n+ tables.  Thank you.  When I started wireless networks they were 802.11 1mb protocols.  Using an Omni & Uni-directional antenna's  I did a lot of 802.11b+ networking. The AC stuff was way too expensive at the time. Compatibility was sparse. 
When I wanted to set the Wlan channel, I was getting an error stating that the device is in use and busy. But after turning the device off and back on again [software-wise] the problem went away. So what I did is the following 
then save and exit the editor. By doing so, the wlan0_setup.sh script will run upon each and every reboot of the RPi.
