Maybe, if not related to VirtualBox, you have a similar problem where an application is forcing to map the drive at boot. Try disabling possible culprits and see if that fixes the problem.
A very similar thing happened to me with VirtualBox folder shares. It turns out that if you manually map network drives using the usual way, but also check "auto mount" in the VirtualBox settings GUI, the drive will be mapped twice, both to the letter you picked in windows and to the last available letter (Z) available at boot. This is easily fixed by disabling auto mount in the VM settings.
There are multiple places where Windows looks to execute programs during startup - take a look at this http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-program-automatic-startup-locations/
I know this thread is very old, but the one thing I did not see in the discussion regards the user object in the directory where the P: drive could be set as the users home directory and mapped on logon, assuming the user is a Domain user, you'll find this setting on the profile Tab of the user object, clear the fields and your GTG.
