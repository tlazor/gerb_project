I know it might be a late response .. but maybe you should check if you have the NameVirtualHost Directive Set up .. if you have too many Virtual Hosts with it set, Apache will override to either the last one in the list .. or give you an error and not start the service at all ..
I have two domains, site1.com and site2.com for the purpose of this post, pointing to this one server. The www subdomain is a CNAME to the main domain. Pinging all four entries (the two domains with and without the www subdomain) all point to the correct IP address.
I'm going with typo in the vhost's ServerName, or else the machine's ServerName points to www.site1.com and that's overriding the vhost's definition.
Can anyone explain why this is happening? I've checked and re-checked the configs, logs, directories and even re-built the server cleanly numerous times and fail to understand Apache's behaviour in this example.
Having enabled both virtual hosts, and restarting Apache, site1.com, site2.com and www.site2.com all point to their correct sites. However for some annoying reason www.site1.com points to the default site (/etc/apache2/sites-available/default) for non-matching virtual hosts.
