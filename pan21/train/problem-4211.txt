Please help me think outside the box on this issue, because there is a web site, I would really like to help out.
I believe that lots of people would keep this page running in the background to help out vulnerable web sites.
I have been thinking about a way to hinder DDos (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks (which seems to be a hot topic at the moment) by placing a signed Java Applet on the web site. This Java Applet should function as a web server so people viewing a web site could utilize their bandwidth to help others access the same web site. The Java Applet should not be included on the front page, but only if you clicked on a link like: "Help us against DDos attacks". Of course the first web page to get distributed to the web server, would be the front page, and just doing this should alleviate a lot. There are a lot of issues with this, which I simply lack the knowledge to solve.
The distributed web servers could communicate with eachother, so they could organize themselves in hierarchies according to bandwidth etc. 
There would need to be a central server to decide what content to present and which servers to utilize, but maybe it could be configured on only communicate with the Java applets so it would only accept incoming connections from certain IP addresses or something like that?
