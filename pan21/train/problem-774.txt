I used this on an old laptop to enable XP to run for incredibly long periods of time. For instance, using a customized service group I was able to get 6-7 hours of usable DVD watching time on a 15" screen with a normal battery for use in airplanes by turning off all network and network related services.
You should visit the Black Viper website for an exhaustive listing of XP services and recommendations regarding what can and can't be turned off for a given set of functions.
Also, use Autoruns from Sysinternals to remove unnecessary start up entries, context menu entries, and unneeded or broken drivers. Using AutoRuns is more of a power user tool though, as there is little documentation beyond your own sense as to what items to disable or remove.
What settings, options, files can I delete, turn off, change to make Windows XP as fast as it can possibly be?  I don't need UI, I need performance.
Basically, what things should I do to tear Windows XP down until it is as fast as it can be without upgrading the hardware.
I'm using a program called Quemu to run a virtual machine on another computer of mine.  The computer I'm using this on is slow and has a lot of admin locks on it.  I've gotten a copy of Windows XP to run in the VM but even on my computer, it runs extremely slow.  This is because Quemu is completely portable because it doesn't utilize drivers.  This allows me to use it even when installations and other things are blocked.
Now, I don't need a pretty VM.  I just need it to be usable.  I could live with its current speed but I plan on using it to develop software in VS2010.  I don't think it will be fun.
