Now i remember that i used tweak do disable LastAccess but restoring it does NOT help. Can anyone help me out? This are not system files, ran the sfc - no problems, the files are not specific - basically every .exe/.dll behave like this.
i have some serious problem with Windows Explorer. I created question about it, but i didn't narrow down the problem. My problem is that Windows Explorer refreshes the folders too slow - what i mean is this: Everything works perfectly, i delete a file and after refresh the file is still there, as you may imagine A LOT of programs crashes because of this behavior. All of them with IOExceptions i tracked the problem by Process Monitor and got this:
This is "recorded" after the file is being deleted and this is what is preventing me from accessing it. LockHunter says that the process locking the file is System (no path, no other info). In the beging Windows Explorer is trying to delte the file, as you can see unsuccessful, notice the last 4 lines - System, after that every operation is possible with the file. How can i identify this process?
