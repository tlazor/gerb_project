2). Supervisor and init.d do not strictly serve the same purpose. Init.d is an "Initialization Daemon", its purpose is to be the service that starts all the other services (like, say, Gunicorn). Supervisor is a Process Control Manager which can be used to start other services as well as monitor and restart them if something goes wrong. Supervisor, however, still needs init.d (or its successor Upstart) to start it at boot up. I prefer to use Supervisor because its easy to use and lets me start, stop, and/or restart Gunicorn workers quickly.
3). You usually have some sort of dedicated development environment that's a copy of production. I personally use 3 cloud servers, 1 for production, 1 for staging (a.k.a., the testing ground for making sure the application deploys correctly), and 1 for development. Staging and development are copies of production.
1). It could be, but from my own research and experience its generally better not to run Gunicorn in daemon mode and use some sort of dedicated process manager instead (like Supervisor).
