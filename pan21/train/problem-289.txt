I think I also added some logic to prevent sleeping boxes to from colliding with other boxes... therefore only active (moving) boxes could collide with non-moving boxes. This way, sleeping boxes wouldn't get tested against other sleeping boxes (if neither of them are moving, then how can they collide?).
Since then, Box2D has implemented all of those features... Sadly, I never submitted those changes, so I can't claim anything for that.
I modified the Box2D source to include axis aligned bounding boxes, which allowed me to get round-abouts 500 colliding boxes before it started lagging, and went on to add a Quad Tree (seeing as how this is 2D, and not 3D, octrees are pointless). After the Quad Tree implementation, I was able to get about 1000 colliding boxes before is started lagging. Keep in mind, these boxes were all sitting on top of each other, actively colliding and applying forces upon one another, slowly stabilizing.
Back in the day, I started using Box2D before they had any kind of collision culling. Used to be (on core 2 duo 2.4Ghz), I could have a maximum of 50 colliding boxes before the simulation started lagging severely due to the lack of culling.
