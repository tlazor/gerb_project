rzlines' answer is, electrically, kind of weird. It may work, but I would guess it's because the headsets are identical and you're not talking over each other. The audio quality is almost certainly degraded, however. See this article on why using a Y-splitter backwards is bad.
However, what I would recommend in your situation is to simply split your headphone output and use a simple desktop microphone to pick up both of your voices. When you think about typical conference-calling systems in company boardrooms, they're usually just using an omnidirectional condenser in the middle of the table.
You can always do the call on the PC with a microphone and speakers.  I often use my laptop's built in mic and speakers when joining a Skype conference with more than one person in the room.
The "right way" to do this would be to use a tiny little mixer to mix your microphone signals before going to the input of your sound card (or build the project described in the article referenced above).
It's for making conference call with 2 computers but with 3 people (2 of them in the same computer under 1 skype account).
