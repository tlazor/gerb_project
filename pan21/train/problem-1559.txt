These files indicate to the operating system how the chipset components are to be configured, and as far as I know Windowx XP lacks support for the chipset out-of-the-box. And without them the computer will work much slower the usual.
HP writes their own graphics drivers.  I've personally had a lot of experience with this model laptop as it's what we use at work.  I think the graphics drivers are not working correctly.  My boss has an 8530p laptop with an ATI graphics card.  He has the same problems with Windows explorer not working as it should.  The screen takes a lot longer than it should to redraw itself.  The best stable solution I've found is to change the transition effect (Right click desktop, Properties, Appearance, Effects) to scroll.
You haven't written which model you're using, but it should be pretty easy to find the right driver on HP's site.
You can very easily find out if it's an application that's slowing you, by doing a safe reboot and seeing if the performance then is normal. VS2008 will work in safe mode and is a good test program.
Go back to the IT department and describe the problem, it sounds like you've got a duff laptop. If the company expect you to develop on it, it needs to be up to scratch.
If safe-boot solves your problem, then just disable the applications one by one until you find the guilty one. If not, then the fun starts : it's either a problem with the Windows setup (a driver or whatever) or even hardware.
