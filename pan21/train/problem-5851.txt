One more thing: do you need to use http or https? that can cause problems, too, and doesn't always tell you the problem. Especially if for some reason the hosting company is using a non-standard SSL port.
Are the IE clients that are not getting through to the host in your internal network or are they on the Internet?  If they're on your internal network check DNS, check proxy settings in your IE clients.
Make sure you can ping the external server, and can access it with something else, i.e. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, even Lynx. Maybe try using IE 6 or IE 8, as there have been changes between all three versions.
What are the firewall policies between your local network and your remote site? What devices are you going through, (example firewalls, routers, ISPs, etc) to get to the "Remote Server"
Also, check and make sure your DNS is returning the correct IP address. It may not be able to find the IP address if there's a DNS error.
If other user-agents (as Tom Willwert hints at in his comment) then I would start by seeing if some sort of URL rewrite filter is employed by your host (such as ISAP_Rewrite).  They have the ability to match user-agent strings and send clients elsewhere based on the results.
check if there is a robots.txt in the root of the site on the blocking server. if so, check that there is no rule in there disallowing ie.
Otherwise, probably check IIS settings, and make sure both platforms are using the same version of things (SQL server if used, IIS (probably identical), system updates).
What exactly do you mean by "does not allow".  Is it intentionally blocked or is there just an error?
