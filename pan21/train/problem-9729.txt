Junctions are very old technology.  They were introduced in Windows 2000, so they are compatible with every version of Windows.  They are typically used only for directories on the same local volume.  The classic example is for the C:\Windows\sysvol\sysvol\[your ad domain name] directory, that is actually a junction point to C:\Windows\sysvol\domain\.  
A Windows 7 system has thousands of links.  Many exe and dll files located in the C:\Windows\system32 directory are actually links to files located in the C:\Windows\winsxs directory.  That is one reason that the winsxs directory should not be "cleaned up".  You can view the links by running the following command from the C:\Windows\system32 directory.  
There's at least one circumstance where you can't replace a junction point with a symlink: if the content might need to be accessed remotely.  If you access a file share on a Windows machine, junction points are interpreted by the server and work as expected.  Symbolic links are interpreted by the client (i.e., a symlink to c:\foo\bar would be interpreted as pointing to the client's C drive) and are disabled by default anyway.
Another piece of Windows trivia:  In Windows 7, Microsoft created an infinite loop on the C:\ volume.  The "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Application Data". "Application Data" is a junction that points to "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\" for compatibility with legacy applications.
