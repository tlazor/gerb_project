Another alternative would be to get a phone based token so you are not reliant on a specific desktop and the flakiness of wine.  Most phone platforms are supported.
Recent versions of Ubuntu offer the stoken package, a native open source SecurID implementation that includes a CLI, a GTK+ GUI, and a library API.
There isn't a RSA Software token for linux, so you will need to resort to using Wine (or running windows in a virtual machine).   There is a thread here where the Wine version and RSA Software version detailed that has been found to work.
I've made myself a script to generate the passcode from command line, so I don't have to deal with a windows app. It basically runs wine in the background, grabs the output and prints it to console.
I have Windows, Mac, and Linux computers; but I am only able to connect to some of my company's websites through the Windows and Mac machines at the moment because they are the only ones with RSA SecurID software tokens. I'm curious: is it possible to set up a SecurID software token to work on a Linux system (in my case, Ubuntu)?
