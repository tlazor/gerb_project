If you have one of the early versions, there were a few manual updates every so often that updated the scan engine. These were not automatic and required you to do something.
Whilst ChrisF is pretty much spot on, and I believe that the person is trying to scam you for money, but there are a few times where MS Security Essentials can be out of date.
I have been informed by iYogi (Dell "support" in India) that the "microsoft security layer" has expired on my Windows Vista Home Premium which was installed in Jan 2008 when I bought my Inspiron 1420 from Dell.   Is this possible ?  I have automatic Windows Updates turned on. iYogi wants me to renew this for a fee. Does the microsoft security layer need to be renewed ? I have never re-installed the Vista operating system on my laptop. 
If however you did originally see the green icon / it showed everything was correct, then, you had the latest version as if it requires manual intervention, it will be orange and let you know what steps are involved.
