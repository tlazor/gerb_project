Because you mention that it works better in Windows 8, it could be a driver problem.  Make sure you have up-to-date windows updates, including optional updates which sometimes have vendor specific hardware updates. Try locating your network adapter in your device manager, right clicking the adapter and select "Update driver software..." If this is already up to date, try uninstalling and reinstalling the driver.  If this is a dongle and not internal card try searching for the driver directly from the manufacturer.
Check this by searching for Power Options in the Start Menu and alternating between power plans as needed. I typically recommend High Performance to see if that resolves your issue. Power settings specifically related to your internal NIC can be found by selecting Change Plan Settings; Change Advanced Power Settings; and adjusting the Wireless Adapter Settings.
I'm sure you've already checked this but have you checked to verify that there are no energy saving settings enforced on the wireless card (selecting the battery icon in the lower-right hand side of the task bar and seeing if you're set to use a Balanced or Power Saver mode)? Being a work laptop I wouldn't be surprised if your IT department has configured by default Balanced or Power Saver battery plans. These can adversely affect your WI-FI performance. Furthermore, these would be different between operating systems.
