Looking at your ZIP file tells the story. good.jpg and bad.jpg are the same file size but bad.jpg compresses from 1.84MB down to 1.03MB whereas good.jgp is almost uncompressable. This indicates that a large portion of bad.jpg has been overwritten with other data that is easily compressible. So a large portion of the image data (DCT coefficients quantised and then compressed) is completely unrecoverable, even if you could reconstruct the header information.
In this case, bad.jpg is missing the first 851,968 bytes of the photo (they are NULLs), so no, it’s not possible to repair the photo, though you may be able to attempt to recover as much of it as possible. Calvin Hass has some interesting information on corrupt photos.
You can use a hex-editor to view the raw binary data in the files. You can also use a differencing tool to view the differences between the files.
(And for the record, you may want to be careful about posting raw, unmodified photos directly from the camera to the Internet; the Exif data could contain some information that you may not want leaked—not usually an issue, but you never know.)
actually what you did to compress the two file has already shown the differences between the two files -
