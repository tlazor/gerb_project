Other clarification:  When attempting to use this method in a new message, however - We still have to select "contacts" from the drop-down menu, where if we create our own group, the name of the "contact group" will automatically fill itself in as you begin typing it in the "to" field.
Not really intuitive, but it worked for me.  I wasn't able to just open the contact group up and hit save as suggested below...although that's probably how it should work.
To solve, as stated above, double click the "Contact Card", which is the attachment in the email sent to you. 
I solved this by double-clicking the contact card in the attachment, selecting the File tab, clicking on the big 'Move to Folder' button, selecting 'Copy to folder...', and then selecting my contacts folder.
All you do is left click on the distribution list in the email and drag it from the email to the contacts button and drop it.
After DAYS of trying to figure this out. All I did that worked was just drag and drop the attachment down to the "people" tab. 
Another way that does work is to double-click the attachment, go to File, Move to Folder, Copy to Folder, then scroll down to Contacts.
