I recommend you read up on the pit falls of shrinking your database files (more specifically your data file[s]).  Paul Randal wrote a great article on this very topic.  The moral here is to know what is happening and what you are doing to your data.  If that is acceptable, and the business demands the smaller database then proceed cautiously.  I will quote Paul Randal with his recommended practice in a situation like this:
And, most importantly, do not make this part of routine maintenance.  For reasons why, see Paul's blog post.
A 1 GB database is next to nothing as far as storage is concerned.  If you are really looking to save space at that level, I'd be apt to question the environment specifics.  Even on a small box, 1 GB is negligible.
Will your database never need to grow to this size again?  This is the main question that should be on the forefront of your mind when you consider shrinking a database.  It's all about proper sizing, not just for today, but for the long-term foreseeable future.
