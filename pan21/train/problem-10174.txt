For downloads, this simply is not possible unless you use DPI (deep packet inspection)/HTTP filtering and actively block .exe .zip filtering etc, but there are still ways around it.
What i did was blocked from ports 1-79, then 81 to 65535 specifically to his LAN IP on my router (VM "Superhub") meaning he can access the internet, but nothing else like p2p software could access the internet. drastic but worked.
I think that rather than trying to block those downloads entirely, using the Quality of Service settings in your router to fairly divide up the bandwidth would probably be best. Obviously, that would depend on what router you have, and what you consider fair, but it's probably a better solution than trying to block downloads like that.
For torrents - if you find out, sell this to the ISPs and they will pay you a lot of money! If your router supports P2P filtering or something similar, it is possible it will try to do a good job, but, it is notoriously difficult to block as it is a penetrating protocol that can get around most blocks.
Is there any way to disable direct download and torrents from the router? Or from the computer?I have a slow internet connection (.40 mbps) and I'm sharing it with another person.
... You can always try to use the firewall and on the other persons machine, block everything other than port 80,443,25,110,143,993,465... (I think those are the most common ones).
I had a similar issue, i allow some of the people i live with to use my 120mb internet connection, but noticed a huge amount of downloads being made, which lagged the servers i host.
