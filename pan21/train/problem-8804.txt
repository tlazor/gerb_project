Chances are it is not undervolt.  Noise is another possiblity.  But again, more information must be provided before the fewer who make informed suggestions can suggest anything.
However, in rare cases, that same undervolt and dimming lights is reporting a serious human safety issue.   Again, never foolishly cure symptoms.  Find and then address a defect.
It is probably many things - if answers are only based in speculation.  Long before saying what it might be, better is to identify what is actually defective.  An incandescent light bulb is a perfect diagnostic tool.  Connect that to the same receptacle.  If undervoltage exists, then that bulb will dim obviously.  
In most cases, a defect is something simple such as an electrician who foolishly connected receptacles using the back stab method (not attaching to the screw).  Or wires not fully wrapped around each other before applying a wire nut.
Your monitor should work just fine even if that bulb dims to 50% intensity.  But if that bulb dims even less, then a wiring problem exists. Never cure symptoms (ie UPS).  Always address a defect.
