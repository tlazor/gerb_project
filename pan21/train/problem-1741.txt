Further, for convenience and to save drive space, common files can be shared by both Linux and Windows. For example, music, photos, videos, Thunderbird email folders and ebooks (e.g. Calibre depository) can be left on the Windows NTFS partition, and corresponding Linux applications can point to them. Because Windows does not work well with the extn disk format, don't move any shared resource to the Linux partition.
If you are going to do this, you will need to decide the format for the hard drive - Windows can't easily read most Linux native formats, and there are drawbacks to using Windows file formats under Linux.  (Depending on the OS, you probably want to run NTFS or EXFAT so the hdd is visible from both OS's)
However, if you want the extra speed a SSD offers, you might clone the HDD to it and thoroughly test it as a dual boot drive. After you're comfortable that the SSD works well alone, then use the old HDD for the predefined MS Music, Pictures and Video folders and other shared resources.
You can use both hard drive and SSD - it sounds fairly practical to have a dual boot Windows and Linux OS (and there swap files) on the SSD, and then conver the 750 gig hard drive to a data partition.
My experience has been that Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) works quite well with 60--100 GB space on the primary drive, so there should not be a necessity to buy a new drive.
