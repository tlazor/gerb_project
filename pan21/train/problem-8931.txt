Some of the partitions, upon reading about it, contain necessary drivers for the OS. I'm curious if deleting all partitions, then doing a clean install of the OS, will restore these partitions. Or if these partitions are related to BIOS and the hardware to even load a bootable USB.
Trying to avoid bricking my laptop, but I'm trying to merge the E:\ with the C:\, but can't due to these system values being between them. Thus, thinking about wiping it clean to hopefully resolve the issue.
Based on your image, you do not have a manufacturer recovery partition.  You are safe to delete all the partitions on your drive and create new partitions on the drive.
It sounds like the partitions you were reading about are manufacturer recovery partitions.  These are partitions created by your computers manufacturer that may contain software and/or drivers to restore the computer to state it was shipped with.  These partitions are not necessary for the computer to function.  However, removing them will break that recovery functionality.  Typically, they can be restored via software downloaded from the manufacturer.
