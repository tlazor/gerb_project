I've seen some suggestions indicating I could set gpgcheck=0 in /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf, but that will disable checks on all channels, and I'd rather just disable it for the internal packages, for which I don't have the keys.
In the /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf file simply create a section corresposnding to the channel name for which you want to disable checks.
For patching of my servers, I've converted from using local yum repositories on the clients under /etc/yum.repos.d, to registering the client with a spacewalk server.
Actually this is very easy, simply poorly documented. (I know, I spent a long time looking for this answer).
However, we have an internal yum repository, and I don't have the GPG keys which were used to sign the packages.  This isn't an problem when using local yum repos, as I can just disable gpg on the repository using gpgcheck=0.  However, it doesn't appear that I can do something similar with spacewalk.  Even though I don't have a key associated with the channel, installing from the command line gives GPG errors (ie: yum install -y somepackage).
From the CLI, I can get around this using the --nogpgcheck option to yum. However, we're using puppet in our environment to install some of these packages, and there doesn't appear to be a simple way to pass in optional parameters to yum through puppet.
The man page doesn't even mention that this can be done. But there are comments in the file that demo it.
