So, in this case, you should create a new package using the Advanced option, identifying the old  package in the Upgrade tab and adding the appropriate mst(s) in the Modifications tab. This should upgrade the existing installations on your network.
There is an existing GPO to deploy a software package, the path is no longer valid.  I need to either edit the UNC path or create a new Package.  I would prefer to edit existing package/modification, or create a new modification in the existing package.  Neither is an option, see screen shot with Add & Remove buttons greyed out.  I have confirmed my user has Full permisions on this GPO object.
Besides using DFS to make this easier going forward what is the best practice for making this type of change?  My research only found this to make an edit http://www.frickelsoft.net/blog/?p=78
Modifications and transforms are applied at the time of assignment or publication. Hence, they can only be added when the GPO software package is created. This is a Group Policy limitation.
The remove package option states "Allow users to continue to use the software, but prevent further installations."  I am unclear if this would apply only to this package?
