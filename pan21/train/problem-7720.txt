Is there a single Windows command/action that can instruct all off-screen Windows to reposition to the closet desktop real estate that is actually visible?
This is slower than the other methods, but works when everything else fails or when you don't want to break your desktop arrangement with a resolution change.
Make your missing window active (from alt-tabbing or from the taskbar), then press alt-space to bring up its menu; it will show up on the edge of your screen even if the window isn't actually on your screen. Select "Move" and bring your window back using the arrow keys. 
The third monitor has been disabled in the monitor setup for weeks now, but I still have windows that want to appear on the monitor that no longer exists. I know how to right-click on the task bar, select Move (for the programs that actually implement that context menu) and arrow-key the windows into view, but I'm really tired of having to do this for something just about every day it seems.
Background: I have a three monitor setup, but sadly one of my monitors has died (control board is probably bad). I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit with an ATI Radeon HD 5670 card.
You can also go to Task Manager, find the process, Right click and then click Maximize or Bring to Front
