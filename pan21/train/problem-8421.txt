"There is a service in the Windows called "Wired AutoConfig" that you need to disable to the Wi-Fi adapter do not be automatic disabled. Do it, and enable the Wi-Fi adapter, he wont be automatic desabled again."
A ethernet (Lan server) connection makes the WiFi disable automatically in windows 8.1. By switching on the WiFi manually let only WiFi to run for few moments and the WiFi goes off again. How can I fix this?
In french I saw "Service de configuration automatique WLAN" and "Service de configuration automatique WWAN". I needed to stop the second one (Wwansvc) and it worked (on windows 10)!
I found a solution for me on https://www.dell.com/community/Networking-Internet-Bluetooth/Wireless-is-disabled-when-Ethernet-is-connected/td-p/4529436
If you cant find any related service, make this changes to "WLAN AutoConfig" service. But this is strongly not recommended. 
For my Laptop HP ZBook 15u G2, it was HP LAN/WLAN/WWAN Switching UWP Services that caused it. After disabling the service, it resolved the issue. LAN/WAN Switching in BIOS was not enabled.
