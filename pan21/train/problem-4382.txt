The newest version of Firefox is not showing in the software package manager so I went to the website and downloaded it. After uncompressing it, there isn't a makefile. It looks like this can be run straight from the directory, but I want to instead update the current version I have so that all the files get moved to the correct places. How can this be done?
I don't know about Ubuntu, but in Opensuse one can add the Buildservice repository for Mozilla, which is used by the people behind the distro for their development and testing and always has the most up to date version.
You can't (easily) have it both ways.  Either you stick to what Ubuntu provides, which may be an older version, or you take what Mozilla provides, which may not be packaged in the way you expect.
It basically is a repository that will keep you Mozilla products up to the date, including minor releases. 
There may be something wrong with your package manager setup, but it's hard to to tell without more details.  Worst case, you can manually download the package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/firefox.  Check that you have security updates activated in your package manager.
I found an easy solultion. I just download the package from the website and unarchived it to my Linux desktop. There is an executable script file called firefox. If I run that, then Firefox starts up. All my settings and bookmarks are there. If I check the version, it's the newest version.
