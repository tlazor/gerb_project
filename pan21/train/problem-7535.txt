Use a second router, give the router a different IP than the default it comes with, this way your guest will be on their own network, have internet access, and cannot access your network on the other router. Be sure the second router is using a different wireless channel than the first router.
I have a network run on a Netgear RangeMax WPN824v3 with wireless access secured with WPA-PSK [TKIP]. I would like to share the Internet connection with guests over Wi-Fi but not give them access to the other computers on my network (or, obviously, my router's passphrase). Some of the newer Netgear routers have this ability. Is there a low-hassle way to do this on my router?
I would suggest using one of your computers (Windows 7) that has both wired and wireless capabilities to provide internet for your guests.  
try Multi-SSID technology. for example, one SSID for coworkers, second SSID for guests (with different vlans)      
Use ethernet for incoming internet on the computer and then installing Connectify or Virtual Router which creates a virtual WIFI hotspot.  This way, they have their own private network, and they can't interfere with your other computers or your router's passphrase, as you have created a separate network for them.
