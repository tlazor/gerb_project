One option, short of using third party service monitoring tools, is to create a script that will send out an email (or other similar alert) and then configure the service to run that script when the service fails.
I like ServersAlive. http://www.woodstone.nu/salive/ in addition to monitoring web servers, it can monitor databases, e-mail servers, ping, etc. It also enables you to verify the chain of dependent network components that sit in front of the web server. This helps you determine the reason your web server is down (switches, routers, DNS, etc.) because it's often not the actual server that is experiencing problems.
Because there's situations where your internal server may not be able to send emails, we setup third-party monitoring through Montastic.  It's free and will monitor a bunch of sites.  You can also set it up to notify several email addresses of outages.  Ours notifies our company email addresses as well as an external "emergency" account.
PA Server Monitor can watch a web page and/or watch the IIS service.  When down it can alert and optionally also restart the service for you.
