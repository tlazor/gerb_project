The current problem is 1and1 can't redirect these free accounts if I use the load balancer DNS name as CNAME in the DNS configuration of the 1and1 control panel. 1and1 can only redirect emails when using IPs in DNS configuration.
If you're using the naked domain (e.g. example.com) for your website, then it's not a 1-and-1 limitation but a DNS limitation. This is why you should never use naked domains for websites -- always use www.example.com (or some other subdomain) instead.
Some people talk about solutions that recommend use of route53 or other domain/DNS providers but I would like to know if i can solve the problem using specifically 1and1. Maybe it's a 1and1 limitation, not sure if other domain providers allow to redirect the domain to CNAMEs while keeping the management of the free accounts they offer.
The web is behind an elastic load balancer in Amazon. I registered the domain with 1and1 which offers 10 free email accounts for the domain so I don't have to care about email servers for the moment.
