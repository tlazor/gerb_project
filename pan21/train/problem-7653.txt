I'm trying to flow data via UDP on two ports of a Netgear GS110TP switch, running the latest available firmware (5.4.2.9).  However, I'm experiencing a small amount of packet loss, something like 0.2%.  This is impacting my application, which needs high reliability UDP data transfer.  
... are all non-zero.  The "MAC Errors" in particular seems to correlate relatively well with the results of iperf.
I have two Linux machines connected directly to the switch.  These two machines are completely different from a hardware and software perspective.  If I remove the Netgear switch and replace it with a dumb 100Mbit hub, I see no packet loss between the two machines.  Sadly, I need to use the Netgear switch, so I need to figure out what is going wrong with it.
I would expect that, given the tiny amount of data compared to the available bandwidth that all the packets would flow successfully.  Even at 5Mbit, I still see a small amount of loss.  I've also tried forcing the port speeds to 100Mbit to see if that helps, which it does not.
I'm a bit unfamiliar with this switch's configuration (and "high-end" switching in general) so I imagine I have something misconfigured somewhere.
