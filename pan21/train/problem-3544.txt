The other approach, which I suspect isn't possible since you're asking, is to restore from your backups ;)
If you have a department on staff that performs computer forensics, I would talk to them for guidance.  They may have more specialized tools that could be available to you.  We use enCase for much of our work, and have had excellent luck recovering deleted files from all manner of filesystems.  Autopsy is also a excellent free tool for doing the same kind of work, though my experience with it is rather lacking.
Basically you can use the commandline tool ext3grep to search through sections of the filesystem. I have not tried this myself YMMV.
Since that question was referred to recently, I'll put another suggestion here: make a plain dd copy of the filesystem (can even be done with the box online, just need space) and find out some plaintext that was definitely in the deleted files (with source code that should be perfectly possible). then strings and grep the filesystem image ... primitive but worked for me at times :)
