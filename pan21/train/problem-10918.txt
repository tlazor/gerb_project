This means that if a user has been given local admin privileges, then it does not matter what the group policy says he is allowed to do on his own computer. The GPO still controls his access to network resources, but not to the local computer.
You cannot fix the situation which you have presented without changing the way you think about it. YOU MUST remove his local admin rights and set up a domain-level permission to install and control his machine, which will inherit from the topmost-level GPO which sets the password-changing policy.  
The proper way to administer users in an active directory situation is to create groups, assign permissions  and users to groups, instead of giving people local admin rights and thereby nullifying any and all hard work done, because that user becomes an edge case which has to be handled separately (by telling him to change his password, or changing the GPO on his computer to specify a password expiration time, which is not the way you want to handle this).  
Those group policies get applied to DOMAIN users as well as LOCAL users, but the least restrictive policy is applied.
With an Active Directory domain, group policies get applied to users, depending on which security group they belong to. You could, for instance, have security groups with different permissions for billers, front desk, IT department, CEOs.
