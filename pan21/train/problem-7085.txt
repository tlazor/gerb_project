Developers of SSL libraries (Microsoft, Mozilla, OpenSSL etc) manage their own list of trust anchors; which is why you see different paths from your end entity certificate to your trust anchor.
In your browsers' trust anchor lists, the certificate with Subject Name "Baltimore CyberTrust Root" and Public Key A has been signed by itself and is therefore a self-signed root certificate.
It is difficult to give a more precise answer as you don't mention which browsers you use nor which version and platform for OpenSSL.
Therefore, history is why they differ.  Mozilla removed the "GTE CyberTrust Global Root" in NSS when Firefox 36 was released. Microsoft probably removed it around the same time too.  Your version of OpenSSL still has it.  Around the same time, Mozilla and Microsoft will probably have added a self-signed root CA certificate from "Baltimore CyberTrust Root" so that certificate chain building still works.
In your OpenSSL trust anchor list, the certificate with Subject Name "Baltimore CyberTrust Root" and Public Key A has been signed by "GTE CyberTrust Global Root".  This is logically the same certificate as your browsers use, although, instead of being self-signed, it is signed by a superior root (superior in the hierarchical sense, not key length).
