It might be a bit difficult to work out all the commands at first but it is a very robust way to control devices connected via HDMI.
Each TV brand calls this something else, like Panasonic Viera Link. But it all uses the same standard just some TV's implement more, some less but the basics should be there. Like turn TV on or off, navigate channels, etc.
Most tutoritals show how to control the Pi via the TV, like XBMC does. Basically you use your TV remote to navigate the menu on the XBMC. But you can do it other way too.
I have tried this one, it connects into the USB port, can record and play back the IR codes, supported by LiRC. I have even tried to plug it into my Android phone and it works there as well.
As an alternative to Infrared, you could use HDMI, if your TV has HDMI 2.0, it will support some kind of CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) implemenatation
cec-o-matic is a useful tool to try and help you decode message that the array of HDMI devices are sending across the CEC network. Remember that you can also control the Pi form the TV via a remote, but that can also be an AMP, Blu Ray Play, etc. It is uni directional.
