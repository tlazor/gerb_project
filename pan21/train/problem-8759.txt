I've just managed to get raspberry pi network boot working (It's great to be free of the sd card). I've worked with network boot before but only for imaging, never with a fully functional remote file system. Since I'm now dealing with 2 separate systems that represent the pi's state (the pi with its ram, cpu registers and the like and a server that contains the file system). I was thinking either going down would be pretty bad as it would leave the file system in a potential unsafe state (as if power had just been pulled). 
So, I started wondering, is there any convenient way to shutdown the storage server but first trigger the pi to shut down? I know I could ssh and run a shutdown script but I was thinking as I already had access to the root filesystem is there an change that could be made that would result in immediate graceful shutdown? I've considered a adding a job to cron but that wouldn't be immediate or doing something unpleasant to a system file but that would hardly be graceful. This question is mostly hypothetical as there are already plenty of possible shutdown options but I was curious about a pure file system approach using only the base rasbian install.
