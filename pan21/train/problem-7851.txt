I had this problem as well a while back and if I recall correctly I simply tried another USB-port and it worked. It is also very important that you make the Windows 7 USB installer following these steps: http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7vista-from-usb-drive-detailed-100-working-guide/

Make sure your USB is not in a USB 3.0 port. Disable XHCI Pre-Boot Mode in BIOS.  This will disable the USB 3.0 port so the Windows Installation doesn't see it, and therefore doesn't require drivers for it.

Here's the easiest solution to the problem without the hassles of locating the correct driver. This issue happens only with the latest builds of windows 7 installer running from a USB drive connected to a USB 3.0 port (usually blue colored). Simply reconnect your USB drive to a non-3.0 port and restart the installer by clicking the close button on the setup window and trying again. Most newer motherboards have both ports.
