To perform an immediate change in velocity, "...such as forces from explosions or collisions." ForceMode2D.Impulse is useful, in conjunction with Rigidbody2D.AddForce (also applicable to the other similar methods on Rigidbody2D). The default ForceMode2D (ForceMode2D.Force) is for applying force continuously, each FixedUpdate.
Depending which phase (input started / completed) you want to trigger on, GetMouseButtonDown or GetMouseButtonUp can be used for reading button state changes. These will only return true once per press, unlike the ongoing GetMouseButton.
As an example, to make a Rigidbody2D rb2d jump towards some point target with a magnitude of jumpMagnitude, you could use:
Your condition, Input.GetMouseButton(0), will be true for as long as that button is held down. Your code therefore updates the velocity of your Rigidbody2D to move it towards the target (tap position) while the button is held down / a tap on the screen is held, which is what produces your 'pinned to the cursor' behaviour.
