The sensible-* programs are installed so that other system scripts etc. can rely on a program which provides a certain functionality being in the right location.
As this point the only people who should be running sendmail are those with large old installations or a need for some of the very complex non-SMTP routing that sendmail can do.
Do I need "sensible-mda"?  No one should be authenticating nor sending via the server - it's just a default local smtp host that's setup to allow for web forms to post to email, and for the system to send system logs, etc.
Either exim4 or postfix are much better options for real mail servers, and ssmtp and nullmailer are much better options for hosts that will only send outbound mail.
Anyway, if you install sensible-mda (or the sendmail wrapper package), the problem you're seeing should disappear.
I have tons of these messages now, where I had none before.  Looking it up, it appears Ubuntu has some special sendmail packages that might not have been installed when I installed sendmail.  
Perhaps you've installed sendmail by using the sendmail-bin individual package instead of installing the sendmail wrapper package.
