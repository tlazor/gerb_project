I get most of my motivation, inspiration, and design ideas from playing other games. In fact, most of my motivating "spark" comes straight from the super nintendo emulator these days.
Because I also have fairly typical interests, I get encouraged by the fact that my game will likely not fail. That it's something I really really want to play helps me keep motivated too.
I am a programmer and have worked on games although never attempted design myself. I am now attempting to design a game myself, working with a modest team of programmers and artists.
Find your OWN need that wants to be filled. My personal game idea is something that I've searched high and low for, but I've not been able to find a great game to fill that void.
Any advice in identifying why a mechanic is fun, and what need a game fills, to help develop my own ideas is much appreciated.
Game designers have been telling me it is important to establish the need your game fills, in order to develop a more complete vision of the product. I think in terms of mechanics and gameplay and am having trouble finding a "hook," even in existing games.
You might pick a pick you like, and figure out how you could improve it. Or take a game that you thought had potential but didn't deliver, and figure out what could have saved it. In the process, you may come up with an idea that you like.
Minecraft (seems to by my favorite example these days) was built because Notch noticed a void that needed to be filled. He filled it and is now a multimillionaire.
