This is probably disabled by the VPN policy and is called dual-homing.  If this is the case, then it may not be possible to get around short of using a separate machine -- even a virtual machine will be trapped in the tunnel.
Try going into Advanced Mode (Ctrl-M), go to the Options menu, and uncheck Stateful Firewall (Always On). This has sometimes worked for me.
Dual-homing is usually disabled to prevent your machine from become a gateway for the transmission of virus, hacking or other nasty bits.
I am not aware of any circumstances where fiddling with the local routing table gets any lasting effects -- you would probably have to write a script to to repeat the fiddling during each connection to the VPN.
Brent's solution is perhaps the easiest.  I personally have a VM for each customer network just so I can be connected to multiple VPNs (mostly SSL-based, but some Cisco clients too) at the same time without having to worry about conflicts.
You could set up a virtual machine (using virtualbox or something similar), and use that to connect to the client, leaving your main connection open to the internet.
Pip is correct about the remote default gateway.  This is a specific choice made by the VPN administrators.  It is sometimes for connectivity reasons -- ie connecting to non-local systems across a corporate network -- and it is sometimes sold as a "security" feature, in that systems connected to the VPN either cannot contact the internet or must do so through the corporate internet presence where presumably such activity can be logged.
