Open Settings, go to WiFi/Wireless (or WLAN on some versions), navigate to the WiFi Network List, press-and-hold on your network, and press "Modify Network".  Enable Advanced Options, scroll down to IP Settings, set the value under it to Static, and scroll down to IP Address, and set it to the specifics of your WiFi network (e.g, 192.168.137.214, as displayed on their page). Android may auto-fill the other values for you, but if not, set Gateway to 192.168.137.1You may have to play around with this value (last digit) to get it to work. Set DNS 1 to whatever DNS server you use (for testing, 8.8.8.8, which is Google's public DNS server). Hit Save and attempt to connect again.
As mentioned above, it could be possible that there isn't a DHCP server built into MyPublicWiFi. You can confirm this by bypassing DHCP and using a static IP. 
I really don't like the look of their page. The creator(s) of MyPublicWiFi may not have built their product well (for example, not including a integrated DHCP server?), and incorrect grammer almost always sets off  my alarms. (for example; "you virtual WIFI-Hotspot"). Try looking around for another solution before going too much further.
Click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (aka ipv4), and click the Properties button below it. The setup is a bit similar to Android, although set the Subnet Mask to something like 255.255.255.0 or 255.255.255.255. Hit Ok, close the dialog behind it, all the usual stuff. Now attempt to connect to the hotspot/WiFi network. 
On Windows (don't care what version):Open Control Panel, navigate to Network & Sharing Center (usually under Network & Internet), click "Change Adapter settings", right-click Wi-Fi (may be different depending on conditions), and click Properties. Don't forget UAC :((
