Try out the command tee.  This command reads from an input and then write to a standard output and file.
A command to run shell commands is sh (the shell), it can be asked to echo the commands to stderr with the -x switch. You can redirect stderr to stdout then.
The side effect of this solution is that the command ('echo my command' in this example) stderr is also sent to stdout. This may be or may not be a problem for you. Also the '+ ' prefix is added to the command.
I have the feeling that something like that exists but as hard as it is to formulate such a question properly, I was not able to dig it up with google so far.
I want to execute a command and pipe it's output into a tool called pastebinit which uploads the STDOUT output to pastebin.
That works very well, however I would like to send the command itself on top of it but w/o typing it a second time.
It's not easy to formulate the question properly, maybe it helps when I describe what I'd like to do.
Save this file and chmod +x it, then use the script you've created to run the command and pastebinit.
