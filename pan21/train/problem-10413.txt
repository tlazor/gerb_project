Will there be some internal logic which distributes the 2GB equally to all 4 banks? If so, who does it?
lets assume the prices are the same but the timings for the DDR3 are much better than the of the DDR4. The transferrates per module are the same. If the data which is allocated by an application does not exceed the capacity of a module and is not distributed equally to the other modules the DDR3 would be the better choice because the timings are better and the DDR4 would not yield any advantage right?
The best literature which I found was this but is does not tell much about how the memeory is managed
I'm a bit confused about how DDR4 works in detail. I'm not very familiar with DDR details or Memory-Controller details. So far DDR4 is advertised everywhere that the transferrates of DDR4 accumulate with every module which I have on my board. For example if I have 4 modules each with a capacity of 4GB and let's say 20GB/sec. I would end up with 80GB/s transferrate with 4 banks filled. In my opinion this works only if I have an application which uses the whole 16GB of RAM. But how fast can the transferarte be if my application uses only 2GB.
