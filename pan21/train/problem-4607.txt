I wouldn't say you're going to have an issue.  Read/Write speeds can vary on a lot of things when it comes to individual desktop setups.  Setting up a RAID-0 is usually only a good idea if you know for a fact that your hard drive is causing a bottleneck.  RAID-0 can reduce or remove the hard drive bottleneck if your hard drive was having problems keeping up with the amount of data it had to write but not necessarily if you had a bottleneck related to reading.
The problem when it comes to reading data is that your computer still has to put that data back together in the correct order.  If you have a controller that is slow or some other process that bogs down the reads from your drives, then you may not get stellar read speeds.
Also, note that while RAID-0 should in theory provide double speeds, it has been almost universally proven that this is never the case.  Depending on the use-case, performance can actually decrease, particularly if you are doing something that has a lot more read operations than write operations.
FWIW, this article on AnandTech shows some tests they ran on different uses.  The article does suggest using the largest stripe size to get the most performance gains, though overall it concludes RAID-0 may not be worth it based on their test results.  YMMV.  http://www.anandtech.com/show/1371/2
