With OpenVPN AFAIK, you only create one tun interface on the central server and then all the connecting nodes are located in this interface's subnet. So you will not run into any limitations on this side.
I have a similar VPN set up even though not to the scale that you are mentionning. We have 80 servers with 80 /24LANs behind them. We use OpenVPN and it works great. The main problem we had was bandwidth overload due to bad supervision and bad planning. That many servers can easily reach 100Mbit/s so you have to plan carefully. Depends on your use that is true but that's the main problem we had.
Configuration-wise, you have to use client specific configuration tying a VPN certificate to a specific route. This can be done with the ccd directory. Keep your configuration clean because with that many servers it can quickly become a mess. Create a little script for yourself to generate the keys rapidly because it will take a while with so many keys. You can just modify the OpenVPN utils to execute silently. Set a long certificate expiry time if security is not much an issue, re-issuing 600 certificates has got to be painful.
