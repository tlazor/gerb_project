Otherwise, you don't have much hope. You will have to reinstall windows using a UEFI Recovery tool (If you laptop has one) or using a USB disk. There is little hope of recovering data using a live disk or similar because the partition is encrypted with BitLocker.
I was trying to set a preboot pin for bitlocker for my laptop. I enabled extended and set the pin in Arabic (thought it wid be more secure). Now at the pin entry page, the keyboard layout is in en-us. and theres no option to change the layout. Any and all help is desperately needed and appreciated.
After much Googling, and finding out that you can't change the keyboard layout during Boot, and that Alt codes don't work either; I was just about to reinstall Windows... but I thought, what the hell, I'll try the ESC for Recovery option. It brings you back to the Windows login screen, and after logging in - it tells you that BitLocker failed to enable. Crisis avoided!
If you have on your laptop, or can plug in, an extended keyboard and you can remember what the actual characters were, then you might be able to enter the Unicode values of the characters (much like when you type an accent for another language). See here.
After enabling Bitlocker, I too set a Boot Password containing a foreign symbol - without realising this exact problem, same as you. I chose the 'Print recovery key' option, and saved it as a PDF on the Desktop.
