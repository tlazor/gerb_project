Nobody's really trying to compete with MS on a Windows platform on user/directory services, so you'll be looking at Linux alternatives, as John mentioned.  I suppose if you have an intern who's collecting $100/day or less, you could look at that $1500 SBS license and figure the kid has 15 days to figure it out.  Otherwise, your savings disappear very quickly.
LDAP is a standard that fits what you describe, and which a MS server (and Active Directory) loosely adheres to.  I'm sure you could find an open source alternative.  It's going to take time to set up, though, and time to administer.  Time that you'll regret losing should you not have backups, so I'd be sure to attend to those, as well.
As cost is clearly a factor you might want to look into setting up a Linux Domain Controller instead of a Windows one. That will give you the functionality you are after without the license costs. Do some Googling and you should find plenty of information on the subject.
Right now for example, the way I see it is that your example network doesn't have proper backups.  Maybe staff copy data off to a USB HD or something, but there is a dependency on staff actually doing it, and the data is scattered around all PCs in a non-secure manner.  Do you really value your data so low that you would be satisfied for things to continue this way?
One way is to buy a server with Windows Server Foundation on it which is a "cheaper than SBS" OEM-only 15 user Windows Server 2008 R2 with no CAL requirements.
I don't know if you're viewing the fuller picture here.  Windows SBS and a 5 CAL pack, which fits neatly into your 10 user example, will only cost about $1500 retail (you can probably get it for a good deal less through a licensing agreement, but either way it could hardly be called skyrocketing) and gives a lot more than just central authentication that I would argue is most definitely not completely irrelevant.
