While the IO of the AT is fairly low, it actually caches files that are uploaded in version control to avoid having to re-build the file from the delta's stored in the database when someone requests that particular version.  Therefore it is still worth doing all the usual good practices with production VM's such as using fixed disks etc
I know many people that run with this configuration and it works well for them.  I know of at least one company with fairly heavy load (24x7 development around the globe with around 200 users accessing the system during the day), and this configuration is working fine for them.  They did have issues when the SQL server was virtualized but have been running fine since SQL was given it's own box.  The key is (as with all VM's used in production) to be sure that the AT VM has sufficient resources and is not competing with other VM's on the host device too heavily.  Under low resource conditions the ASP worker process running in IIS can start recycling heavily which can lead to some issues.
