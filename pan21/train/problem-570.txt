I am looking for a general technique which can help me to prove not just that Buchi automata is more expressive model than LTL, but that the specific formula can/can't be expressed in LTL.
For example, "$p$ occurs at least on even positions" can be described by the following Buchi automata: $({q_0, q_1}, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, \{q_0\})$ where $\delta(q_1, *) = q_0$ and $\delta(q_0, p) = q_1$. 
I've read that that automata can't be expressed in LTL, but I don't understand how to formally prove it.
I think the best way to be convinced of the fact that there is no LTL formula for this language is via $\omega$-semigroups.
Indeed, there is a theorem, that you can find in Diekert/Gastin or Pin, stating that the LTL-definable language have an aperiodic minimal $\omega$-semigroup.
Given a regular language L on infinite words (via an automaton for instance), the minimal $\omega$-semigroup S recognizing L can be computed. To do this, consider the semigroup generated by transition matrices of the automaton, and then minimize it. Then you can test S for aperiodicity : just iterate all the elements $x\in S$ and check that there is always an $n$ such that $x^n=x^{n+1}$.
