Ok so basically I managed to migrate VMs from a cluster to another cluster. These are the steps, First you have to remove the VM from the Failover Cluster Manager, this will still appear in the Hyper-V manager. Once it is no longer protected by Failover Cluster you can use the Move VM from the Hyper-V manager and move it to any host you want.
Yes, but one exception - live migration works only on "compatible cpu's". There actually is a setting in CPU for forcing compatibility mode. If that is not set, and you mvoe for example from AMD to Intel, then - this is not possible in live migration, cluster or not.
You need uncluster the VMs themselves before they can be migrated out of the cluster.  Use the Failover Cluster Manager to cause the cluster itself to stop protecting the VM.  Then you can migrate it using the Hyper-V Manager.
At the moment I'm in a bit of dilemma because I know that Windows 2012 supports "Shared Nothing Live Migration" but recently I got to know that this feature is available for stand alone Hyper-V Servers. My Setup is that I have 3 Servers running Windows Server 2012 Hyper-v Failover Cluster and I need to migrate everything to a new cluster running on Windows Server 2012 R2 and offcourse some VMs can't be turned off during migration so I need to do this live during production hours. Another note is that both clusters will be running on the different LUNs since each cluster has its own CSVs. I need to know if it is possible to migrate such VMs/Roles Live without have any downtime of the VMs/Roles?
