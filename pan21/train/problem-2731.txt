You could use your texture's alpha channel to make another texture.  Any alpha value below a threshold value will be set to fully transparent.  Any above will be fully opaque.  Using this new texture, you could set the values of RGB to be any color you'd like.  Scale this new "texture" to be slightly bigger than your character texture.  This would give you a nice solid color around the character.  Then use that color with your Gaussian shader to give the nice outlined glow around your created texture.  I'm guessing this could be done without creating another texture, and be all shader based off the character texture.
You can do the same thing -- all you need to do is draw the sprite with the opaque pixels coloured with your outline colour. (Maintain transparency values so that round edges still look round).
This works, looks better than drawing a scaled version, and has some other cool properties (like being able to control the outline alpha for boldness, and retaining any "holes" in your sprite image) -- the only drawback is that you can't really control the width of the outline too well.
