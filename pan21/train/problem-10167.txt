Depends on how clean the Windows Vista installation is and what you would install on the Windows 7 installation. So, if you are really going for performance then you would have to do a clean install. If you don't want to go trough all the hassle an upgrade would be better, unless your coming from a very slow Windows Vista installation. One thing is sure, Windows 7 is faster than Windows Vista. ;-)
Extreme tech just did a series on the different options for upgrading from vista or xp to win7.  Basically, their findings were that doing an upgrade install was ok from vista, but there was a lot of performance issues in the system, and recommended just doing a clean install.
It does a fantastic job of backing up all the settings; then on the new install, run the same wizard, and point it to the file.
I tried it and didn't see any performance difference between the fresh install and the upgrade on the same hardware with the same apps on 3 different systems (2 laptops, 1 desktop) so we'll be upgrading, however I'd still generally agree with Matt.
