Now I don't allow SSH connections between EC2 instances and force everyone to connect to the EC2 instances from a bastion host, so at this time only the bastion host has the Expiringhost <<| |>> and Expiringsshkey <<| |>> calls to update /etc/hosts and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.
To handle servers going offline I actually wrapped the Host and Sshkey resource types as Expiringhost and Expiringsshkey and have it configured to remove exported records over a max age (for me set to 45 minutes since my check-ins should occur every 30 minutes) so that old stale entries are removed automatically as well.
You may use some file syncronizer like Unison http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/ but i strongly discourage you to do it. Best way is to setup local DNS server (bind) and put all your hosts there.
I actually accomplish this through my Puppet server that configures my EC2 instances when they come up and online. I have the Puppet server export the IP address and then update the /etc/hosts file as well as the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts files automatically with all known entries.
