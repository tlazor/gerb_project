May be one should be more specific about the construction of G(T) from T. Consider the following (counter)-example: E(T) = {(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)} and then you form G(T) by adding the edge-set: {(2,3), (3,4), (4,2)} then there is surely a planar-embedding of the graph but is not 3-colorable! I know I've been too generous (:) ) in the construction of G(T).
Pick one of the buds for which the cycle passes consecutively through its leaves.  (The lemma guarantees us two, but we only need one.)  Change its color to Red.  Skipping its leaves for the moment, and starting with the "next" leaf (say running clockwise), turn every other leaf Red until you get back around to the Red bud's leaves, at which point you just need to alternate Black and White.  (Note, this works even for the "easy" case where the number of leaves is even.)
Let T be a tree with edges E(T) = { {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {4,5} } and then E(G(T)) = sum of the sets: E(T) and { {1,5}, {5,3}, {3,1} }, since we are connecting leaves 1,5,3 into a cycle. 
We're now in position to complete the proof of 3-coloring for non-stars in the case of oddly many leaves.
As nvcleemp noted (at MathOveflow), one should start with a 2-coloring (Black and White) of the tree and, if the number of leaves is even, simply change every other leaf around the cycle to a third color (Red).  It's only if there is an odd number leaves that we have to do something fancier.  To handle that case, it's helpful to introduce a tiny bit of terminology:  Let's call the vertices that leaves are connected to "buds." 
And I believe that if $T$ is not $K_{1,2r+1}$ then $G(T)$ is $3$-colorable, but my problem is I don't know how to prove it. I was trying to come up with an algorithm that starts with $2$-coloring of a tree and then with third color fix collisions on a cycle, but this led me to nowhere.
