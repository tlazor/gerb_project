A subset $U\subseteq V(G)$ of a graph $G$ is a disconnected cutset if $G[U]$ and $G-U$ are disconnected.
has the same vertex set such that two distinct vertices are adjacent in $G^k$ if their  distance in $G$ is at most $k$. The $k$-th power of split graph 
What about the question of computing the permanent of a matrix modulo $k$?  For $k=2$ this is easy (since permanent=determinant), and Valiant (in "The complexity of computing the permanent") showed it can be computed modulo $2^d$ in time $O(n^{4d-3})$ for $d \geq 2$ by a modified variant of Gaussian elimination.  But for $k$ which is not a power of $2$, it is UP-Hard.  
Here's an example that might be of the type you're looking for. The parameter is not an integer though, it's a pair of numbers. (Although one of them can be fixed to make it a one parameter problem.)
The problem is to evaluate the Tutte polynomial of a graph G at coordinates (x,y). We can restrict the coordinates to be integers. The problem is in P if (x,y) is one of the points (1, 1), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), or satisfies (x-1)(y-1)=1. Otherwise it is #P-hard. 
For all constants k, the problem is in P. (The brute force algorithm runs in time $O(n^k)$.) For large values of k, for example values like n/2, it is NP-complete. When k gets very close to n, like n-c for some constant c, the problem is in P again because we can search over all subsets of n vertices of size n-c and check if any of them forms a clique. (There are only $O(n^c)$ such subsets, which is polynomially large when c is a constant.)
This is an interesting (and surprising) example for a P $\to$ NP-hard $\to$ P $\to$ NP-hard $\to \cdots$ phase transition: 
Consider the k-Clique problem, where k is the size of the clique we're searching for. So the problem is "Is there a clique of size k in the graph G on n vertices?" 
Deciding if a complete graph on $n$ vertices, in which each  vertex has a strict ranking of all other vertices, admits a popular matching is in P for odd $n$ and NP-hard for even $n$. (The parameter is the vertex number $n$.)
