I'm trying to fix an older, messy Windows XP installation. There were about 3 security suites installed (Symantec, AntiVir, and 3rd one) and OS updates were completely out of date.
Now, since the last reboot, I can't connect to the Internet anymore. All IP settings are ok, I can even ping google.com (so name resolution and networking must be ok). Any program the tries to connect to the Internet says it can't connect (IE for example). A telnet connection to google.com on port 80 also fails.
Does anyone have some ideas what I could do to make the network work again? Any hints what the problem could be?
Not an direct answer, but I think you will loose less time if you do a full format and reinstall of the OS. From your description, even if you are able to solve the problems, you will still have a truly messy OS at hands.
Restore the system to before the latest updates are done, do a winsock reset. Remove all the AV software. Turn on just the windows firewall for now. Complete all the updates, then install the latest version of your preferred AV.
If at all possible I would be more inclined to do a fresh OS installation.  Yes, it's more work, but the end result will be a clean baseline in a known state.  Otherwise you run the risk that it'll never be quite right, and the problem may even be made worse by trying to fix it.
So I began running Windows updates, the last one was SP3 and uninstalled all the security suites (the goal would be to install the free AntiVir Version after all other suites are completely removed). The host was always in a local network behind a firewall during this procedure.
