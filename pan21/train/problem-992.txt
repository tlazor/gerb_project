1M dynamic pages a day and "CPU occasionally quite high" sounds to me like you might benefit from further optimizing your page generation.
The other issue that may be useful is that gigabit devices are more reliable in negotiating link speed.  
I'd say that you would probably not notice any page response time increase. Most people cannot access your site that fast in the first place. The only reason, I can see for needing GbE, is when you are responding to so many page requests, that your aggraget bandwidth usage is maxing out your connection.
Older network devices that do 10/100 tend to be a bit unreliable in negotiating link speed and duplex, while if you've got pure gig everywhere the auto-negotiation is pretty much 100% reliable.  
On the other hand if you are going to split out a database server that itself would talk to two web servers, then putting a Gb network between those webservers and the database server quite probably would yield improvements.
Undocumented hard-coded ports or servers tend to cause problems in the distant future when you need to move a system from here to there in a hurry and then can't figure out why you're getting terrible network performance (duplex mismatch).
I had one user try to tell me that a Gb interface on his web server might not improve throughput, but because it was faster it reduced latency.  While this might be theoretically so, the improvement in latency seen by the web user at the far end of the much-slower-than-Gb internet uplink would be so reduced as to be unmeasurable.  You'd improve latency at the user's end far more by decongesting a router in between the server and the user.
Gravyface makes a very useful point in the comments about local gig being useful for things like reverse proxy servers, or if you had a local database server.
