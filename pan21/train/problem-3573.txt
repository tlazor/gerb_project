Or, to summarise the answer, at the moment you've either got to do port-forwarding so the server can reach all the clients directly, or install some kind of site-to-site VPN so the server can reach all the clients directly.
The munin chaps seem to be aware of the need to do this, and they have a project in progress called munin relay, which would allow you to set up a single box at each site that could be seen by the central munin server, and in turn could see all the clients at that site, and which would proxy/relay the munin pull requests from the central server to the (unreachable to the server) clients.
Unfortunately, as the page states, this project isn't working yet.  So you can either contribute to the project and make it work, or wait until it's ready, or use one or more of the three other methods listed on that page for contacting the (currently directly-unreachable) clients: tcp proxy, ssh tunnel (or some other vpn, I'd be inclined to look at OpenVPN or IPSec) or ssh:// requests (which will also require port-forwarding).
