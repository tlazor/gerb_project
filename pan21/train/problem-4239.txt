However, the general idea should be clear now. Try to isolate the actual problem (is it network related or a config problem?). Maybe this video can also help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCgRF4KOYIY&t=76s 
The error message says clearly the MySQL server could not be reached, hence check everything that could block access to it. This is not user related.
If you can answer all that with yes there should be no problem connecting to the MySQL server from MySQL Workbench. Point 6 can be a bit more complicated, if your MySQL server is not on the same machine as where the SSH endpoint is or if it has networking disabled or if it uses a different port than what you tried.
I am facing the same issue. As weird as it can get I found that I can only connect to the server using the "Topbar -> Database -> Connect to Database..."
same issue i faced with mysql workbench 6.3.8 build 1228 CE (64-bits) community with kubuntu 18.04 version.
i set connection method standard tcp/ip over ssh and when i try to connect to remote server it asks for ssh password and after successful ssh tunnel it asks for remote mysql password ( which was expected as i did not store passwords in keychain -- option available there in connection window ) and when i entered it i got same above error.
