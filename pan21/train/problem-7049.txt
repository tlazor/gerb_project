The first is to have the client send the name of the host that they're interested in with the initial request. This is what http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication delivers, but that isn't supported by all clients (see the wikipedia page for the list of what does and doesn't work for it). With SNI, the hostname is available at the start of the secure negotiation, so the server can pick the right certificate to respond with.
This latter one isn't necessarily as bad as it first sounds though. One option is to get a wildcard certificate, eg *.mysite.com . As long as you're serving www.mysite.com and images.mysite.com (i.e. both within the same wildcard space) you're fine. The other option is to use subjectAltName in your certificate. With this option, your one certificate is valid for multiple websites. That way, when you send the one common certificate back to the client, it'll be valid for whichever of the hosts they wanted. Quite a lot of CAs support this latter option, and it's generally the only option for EVA certs (you can't generally get wildcard ones of those), and you'd normally just ring up your CA every time you wanted to add a new vhost onto that IP, and they'll charge you a small fee and issue a new cert with the extra name in it.
If you're not able to use SNI, then you have a slight problem. The client turns up and says "Hey, I want to do SSL" but you don't know what host name they want, so you can't pick the right certificate. All you know is the IP address. So, to do that you have to ensure that the certificate you return is valid for all the different vhosts on that IP.
