@Spikey_Richie's answer above looks mostly correct, although you'll need to do this in groups for each user above.
The result will be that the data in columns A and B will remain as they are now, and column C will be re-ordered.
I suspect the way that this has come about is by doing a sort with Autofilter set up, but not including the final column.
You need to highlight the column with your incorrect dates in, go to the Data tab on the ribbon and sort A>Z, and at the 'Sort Warning' dialog select 'Continue with the current selection'
As it stands, the only way we can know what the correct value for the final column is, is by the fact that you've told us in the question.  There would be no way of us knowing this (for sure) otherwise.  We would have to make assumptions that may or may not be true.
I would suggest going back to the original data (pre-sorting) and re-sort it, making sure that the whole set is ordered.
I think your 'after' is wrong based on your question, but I have answered with what I think you're trying to get to.
