This means the issue is probably to do with the htaccess file and the servers ability to use it. I would first try putting "rubbish" into the htaccess file (anything that is not valid Apache configuration). If the htaccess file is being read correctly all requests that cause the file to be read will generate a 500 Internal Server Error.
If you're still interested in solving the issue I have some suggestions. The basic idea of the configuration is fine, I tested it on a simple setup and the headers were set correctly.
Next run apachectl -S and check the output, put it in your question if you are unsure. You need to make sure that the request maps to the <Directory> block in your question. I'm afraid there is little you can do except search through your configuration files. While you do this make sure AllowOverride is not overridden somewhere.
Also you are using mod_fastcgi, so depending on your configuration, the request may not be mapping to a directory on the file system at all, which is required for the htaccess file to be read.
