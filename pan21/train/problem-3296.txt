This could be done by first creating the VM and then once its running change the network settings. But not on the VM creation. Im not sure if Xen has a command but even if it doesn't you could use any provision tool directly on the OS.
I think the answer to this has to be "no".  Given that a VM could be any OS type - so configuring an IP in Windows is different to Linux.  But even if they were all linux VMs, different distributions store IP configuration in different places.  There is no way for virt-clone to track any of this, and it isn't its role.  As commenters have said, dhcp is the right way to do this - you can control MAC addresses outside of the VM so you have fine control over what IP each server gets.
I think the answer is no. The same was asked in the Citrix forums before and the reason is actually very simple. Xen is the virtualization layer, so it can create the VM but inside configuration which is done in the OS is actually not related to Xen anymore. Configuring an IP is basically editing the network configuration inside the operating system. Something outside Xen scope.
You could always change the network settings with some script once its running and restart the network, that would accomplish the same thing.
If dhcp is really out of the question, though it doesn't seem to be, I would configure your source VM that you are cloning with a static IP that isn't used elsewhere.  Then have a startup script on this VM that talks to some central store to obtain its post-cloning IP and hostname configuration at startup.  So it boots with the standard IP address, retrieves its "proper" configuration from somewhere, and reconfigurs its IP address during its first boot.
Another option would be to virt-clone the VM, then run a script that mounts the partition containing /etc/ and updates the IP address configuration.
