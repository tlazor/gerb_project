Note that w/ a Windows server in place then network browsing works better if DHCP is done on server & DDNS is enabled.  See:
Because AD depends on DNS internal workstations should only use internal AD DNS servers.  Having an external 2ndary DNS will cause unpredictable browsing, logon and network performance issues in an AD domain.
DNS settings are incorrect.  DNS IP's point to DNS servers, the terminology of "DNS gateways" is incorrect and misleading as DNS servers only respond to queries, they don't do any packet routing. 
Both of your clients have their DNS settings pointing to servers other than your domain controller.  I would recommend manually trying a lookup of a FQDN using a specified server.  like  nslookup google.com 8.8.8.8 would use the DNS server 8.8.8.8 to lookup google.com.  Replace 8.8.8.8 with the IP of your domain controller and google.com with a FQDN on your domain.  If that works remove all other DNS client settings other than your DC.
Using a .com like BVOffice.com for an AD name is often problematic and not recommended IMO. Currently there are no public DNS records but if this is not your domain name then I would either buy it, but I would still change the internal AD name to bvoffice.local.  Using .com for an AD name can be managed (mostly...) but requires a good understanding of DNS and TCP/IP.
Yes, if the Windows DNS server goes down then the internet is also down.  If that's the case then there will be larger issues and the DHCP scope on the router can be enabled at that time.
