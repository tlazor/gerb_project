I have certainly not explained the problem correctly , I'm sorry for that and thanks a lot if you understand me (even more if you have the answer :p)
With a sky box, you have a giant box that is surrounding your scene. This will make it seem as if you are in a 'box'. With a sky dome, you have the same box, but this time the projection of the texture onto the cube is spherical. Problem with this technique is that the projection does not cover the bottom of the cube (which is not a problem in most cases). You can also go with a literal dome, that is, a sphere (which Kromster suggested), although it comes with its own share of problems (pinch points). Then there is the sky plane where only one (very large) plane is rendered. The drawback here is that you will see the horizon, so you can only use this technique in closed areas. 
As for keeping the sky where it is when you move etc. Kromster suggestion is correct. You will want to, however, make sure that all your objects are rendered on top of the sky. This is very easy to do, simply render your sky first, then without swapping buffers, render your scene. 
i want to put a texture as a background in opengl-es , and when we rotate the view , the background rotate too (obviously) but when there is translation , the background doesn't change.
Simplest way would be to make a big low-poly sphere (or a segment of it, depending on view area restrictions), face its polygons inside and attach to camera position, so wherever your camera is going the sphere will remain around it. And map texture to this sphere.
