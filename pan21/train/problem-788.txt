However, what this seems to do is trigger a poll of the repo, where is then tries to build any branch that is different from the main branch.
Bitbucket do supply quite good features in terms of Webhooks, which when used with the Jenkins Git Plugin, do allow for triggering of builds based on various Bitbucket events (eg a Pull Request update).
Up to now, we have used the Bitbucket Pull Request Builder, but it is very flaky and unreliable, and not supported well.
There are various ways to trigger a Jenkins job from an SCM like Bitbucket, but what I want to do specifically is trigger a build using the branch that is the source of the Pull Request.
Our use case is that we allow developers create their own branches, for which they then create Pull Requests to the development branch.
There doesn't seem to be any way to trigger a build that uses the developer created branch as the build branch (other than the aforementioned Bitbucket Pull Request Builder).
There is also the Bitbucket Webhook plugin, but again that doesn't offer much in terms of dynamically choosing the branch you want to build.
