I have entered two lines in a wide enough cell. I used CTRL+Return combination at the end of the first line to wrap the text and entered the second line.
The row height can be set by selecting the row (click on row number in left most column) and then right clicking to get a drop down menu that includes "Row height..." and "Optimal Row height...".  This is not as convenient as, for example, choosing a line spacing of 1.5x, but it does work.
Writer has line spacing settings, but Calc does not.  Format -> Spacing and Format -> Paragraph are permanently disabled in Calc.
I was able to set different style for the two lines, however I could not find how to set the line-height, the space between the two lines.
This question was also asked at https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/31054/how-can-i-adjust-line-spacing-for-cells-with-word-wrap-in-calc/, where more ideas for workarounds are given.
My suggested workaround is to insert an empty line and a space (Ctrl+Enter, Space).  Then select the space and change the font size.  Here is an example using font size 2 for the space, and normal size 10 text.
