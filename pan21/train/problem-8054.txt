So when a program is ran as a service, and you use the HOMEPATH environment variable, where does that map to?
I have a program that's being run as a Windows 7 service. In the program, the HOMEPATH environment variable is being used to set the location of a file. Normally, when the program is simply ran at a command line, HOMEPATH will be mapped to the logged in user's home directory. However, this isn't the case with a Windows service.
For your specific scenario you could have the service write an event log entry, and print what it stores in the HOMEPATH variable. In C# you could use:  
Services typically are run under one of three service accounts, Local Service Local System and Network Service. For all of which the HOMEPATH variable is null.
You can set what account a service uses (your user account for instance), in the services properties window or in the service install config. When I tested with my user account the event log entry displayed The HomePath for this service is '\Users\Admin-PC'.
