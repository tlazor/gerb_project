With this configuration, the gateway itself is connected to the Internet and works properly - but all of the internal 10.0.0.0/24 hosts have no connectivity.
I'd really like to have a dead simple gateway with nothing but gateway_enable="yes" and a single, static route ... but I wonder if this is not possible because both networks are non-routable, private address space ?
If you can check the internet gateway configuration and add a static route to 10.0.0.0/24 via 10.1.1.20 you will not need any NAT.
I think that you are missing a route. The internet gateway might be unaware that there is a 10.0.0.0/24 network behind 10.1.1.20.
I don't want to run a firewall or have a pf or ipfw ruleset - I just want a simple gateway between the two networks.
Default gateway to the Internet is 10.1.1.1 and my gateway system gets assigned 10.1.1.20 on the external interface and has 10.0.0.1 on the internal interface.
Do I require NAT in this situation, or is it possible to have a simple router with no NAT or firewall config ?
