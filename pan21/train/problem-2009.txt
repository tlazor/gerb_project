I currently have some SQL Servers that sit on a sub-domain. We are eliminating that sub-domain and moving everything to the regular domain.
We did the same thing a while ago. The change went smoothly, we just had to change the various service accounts. We stopped all services before the move, then changed the accounts, then started everything without a hitch.
-Make sure you have admin rights to the machine, and add the new domain users mirroring permissions off the old one.  
The domain name is part of the server name!  Open up SQL Server, SSMS, expand security for the server and look at the users.  Notice the Windows users are OldDomain\UserName?  It never changed.
Those would be the main steps needed to ensure a smooth domain rename.  Clustering is even more sensitive to it.
As far as SQL Server configuration goes, is there anything I need to change aside from potentially using different service accounts?
Internally, SQL Server doesn't know the server changed domains and thus has a different 'fully qualified host name'.
