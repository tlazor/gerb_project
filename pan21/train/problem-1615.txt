The critical permissions are on the directory containing apps.  Suppose it is in /spare/apps, but you do not have write permission in the /spare directory, then the 'rm' command will remove everything it can, but it is unable to do the final step because removing /spare/apps involves writing to /spare, and (under my hypothesis) you do not have permission to  write there.
What system are you running? Does your system support the immutable or undeletable flags? If it's supported, and set, you'll get this exact result. 
Is the directory empty? If it so, you could try with rmdir: if again it fails, you could try to contact the server admin.
first Check the created/modified time for the directory using 'ls -l' ( or you can use stat <dir>) and remove the directory 'rm -rf dir' and again check the times. If there is any changes in time, there is some other process creating it. If so check for any running process using 'ps -ef' which may creating this directory again.
On my system, chflags noschg nouchg will remove the system and user immutable flags; and chflags nosunlnk nouunlnk removes the system and user undeletable flags. The commands on other systems may be different.
