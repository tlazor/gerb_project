If you still are unsatisfied with the speed of Nmap for UDP scans, you'll probably have to look at an asynchronous scanner like unicornscan.
For speeding up UDP scans, you'll likely have to sacrifice some accuracy for speed. Some options that may help include the using the gross timing options -T<digit> (3 is default, use 4 or 5 to speed things up), setting --max-retries to a low value (less than 3), setting a --max-rtt-timeout using the instructions in the man page, and reducing the number of ports scanned. A scan of 65535 ports is going to take a long time no matter what (and did you know that port 0 is a valid port?). Pay attention to be sure hosts with open ports are not timing out (set the --host-timeout option to a high value if so.)
The aim is to speed up scan results. Since UDP scan is also involved it is taking forever to complete. 
With the command you posted, the only service information is generated with a simple lookup of the port number. There's really no perceptible delay there, and so it cannot be disabled.
Is it possible with nmap to check only the state of a port whether- open, closed or filtered and NOT the services behind it?
I would suggest splitting this into two scans: one for TCP and one for UDP. That way you can get the TCP results without delay while the UDP scan runs. This can also help Nmap with its internal timing calculations.
