This creates a completely isolated virtual LAN in Hyper-V that's double-NATted behind the virtual firewall and your local physical LAN. I like this isolation as it allows me to mostly emulate a regular LAN environment, where my physical LAN represents the cloud.
Of course, you'll need to configure DNS, DHCP, etc. according to the needs you've identified for your lab.
Not every lab needs this kind of isolation, but I recommend it anyway just because it's useful. Once it's set up the first time, you can add and remove VMs to the private v-switch without needing any more network configuration.
An external v-switch bridges your physical network adapter to a virtual switch port that Hyper-V creates on your host. Connecting your VMs directly to an external v-switch essentially adds them to your local physical LAN the same as connecting physical computers to a physical switch on your LAN. This can have undesirable consequences, such as:
In order to isolate my virtual lab from the physical environment, I set up my Hyper-V lab in this way:
As Joeqwerty said in his comment, "internal" and "private" virtual switches in Hyper-V do not have any access to your local physical LAN or the internet. In order for your VMs to access the internet, they must be connected to an "external" v-switch.
