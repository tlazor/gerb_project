Keep in mind that WiFi has a lot more variables that Wired Ethernet -- so "Practical" speed is often different that "Theoretical Max" speeds.
It's likely that your WiFi card on your laptop will only support speeds of 300-350 Mbps -- that sounds a lot like the high practical end on most mainstream WiFi adapters.
So, I have switched to a gigabit internet connection at my house.  Through the internet provider's modem, I consistently get between 800-950 Mbps when I check.  But, through the wifi on the internet provider's modem, I get around 300-350 Mbps.  So, I got out my relatively new router that I thought I bought to do gigabit speeds and it still pumps out 300-350 Mbps.  So, I was in Best Buy and was talking to a guy there and he said I just needed a better router.  I got a new linksys router (MAX-STREAM AC5000) with three bands.  The 5G band I think is rated at 2166 Mbps.  Anyways, I plugged it up and now get around 500-550 with my computer plugged up a foot away.  I was going to move my computer back to where it was in the other room to see if it goes back down to 350, but 500-550 is still not even close to the speed of my wired connection..
Am I just dreaming in this day and age to get a gigabit wifi connection?!?  Or am I doing something wrong here?
