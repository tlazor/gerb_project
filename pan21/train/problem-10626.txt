If you don't think you have the prerequisite knowledge for this, it is going to be too difficult to be worth bothering with.
If you understand the nature of http exchanges and basic html, you could reverse engineer the login and automate it with, e.g., wget or curl or some simple client in python, perl, etc.  You need to fetch the login page and then send an approporiate response, probably POST data but there could be other mechanisms.  Watching an exchange with wireshark should enable you to see the details of what is going on.  Cookies probably are not involved since you are authorizing yourself for low level internet access.
I ended up writing a Python Script to log onto my School's network (LS Systems based). Thanks again to Goldilocks and Joan for their contributions, it helped massively. Firstly, I found the login fields view Formfind (perl script), then I located a URL which logged me out and then directed me through several redirects until presenting the user with the actual login page. The page is time sensitive so I had to actually view the page to get a unique ID so I could login. I could not copy and paste a solution from my computer. I then filled in the field after faking my User-Agent as my Mac from Safari and submitted the form. I did this via the Mechanize module which I installed easily via easy_install mechanize. 
The problem with this is it doesn't involve any kind of standard or protocol.  That doesn't mean it isn't possible in general, it just means there probably isn't be a pre-existing solution in a specific case.
