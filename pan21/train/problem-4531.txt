Once you get access to an API or database, you can query it for more details. How to do this depends on the database you gain access too, it would be too tedious to summarize that all...
What you need is a Reverse Phone Lookup API. There are several out there however I have yet to see one that is free for the volumes you are looking for or is not some form of closed alpha/beta.
Take a look at Sobolsoft. I do not know anything about the company or their software, but if it does what it says, it is what you are asking for. It was the only bulk solution I was able to find.
You can upload up to 10,000 phone numbers via a tab delimited text or csv file into the searchbug reverse phone batch append tool. The fee is only charged for hits (matches) so if nothing is found for one or more numbers their is no charge for those.
You need to look for a database for your local country, or perhaps ask your ISP. If no such database exists then you could opt to OCR a phone book, in case there is no electronic version available. Alternatively, a call log with such information could do the job, most only contain phone numbers though. Some might not give information to you out of privacy reasons, so it might be that this is impossible.
