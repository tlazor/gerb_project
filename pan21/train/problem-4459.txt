There is also a new chrome extension that adds vim-like keybindings for browsing as well called Vimium.
These are some other programs that offer application-specific solutions: I use Viemu, which provides a vim emulation layer in Visual Studio 2005/2008, Outlook and Word.
Until somebody writes @Ignacio's SCIM/IBus plugin (which would be splendid with NeoVIM), here's a workaround with xclip. It pastes into a temporary file and edits it with Vim:
I use vi-style editing in bash and vimperator for web browsing with firefox (sadly doesn't have :vsplit). In firefox the fantastic It's All Text! plugin configured to use gvim makes input boxes (likes this one) less crappy. mutt picks up my $EDITOR without problems (tell Karen to set that variable, too).
You'll probably want to assign a keyboard shortcut to this script, so you can do something like CtrlA, CtrlC, SuperC
I've not seen anything to allow this, but it sounds like it could be handled by writing a module to plug into an IM such as SCIM or IBus.
This isn't exactly what you are looking for, but I also have experienced the desire for vim keybindings everywhere. One solution I've used is Touch Cursor, which I mapped so that my home row keys would allow me to navigated my cursor. The default arrangement is not vim-like, but you can easily change that. It may take some getting used to holding the space bar to achieve chords, but I found it pretty natural.
