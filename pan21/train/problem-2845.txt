I will assume that your app runs consistently on each machine - that is that on the machines where it runs quickly, it always runs quickly.
There are so many variables in web design that can impact performance, but in your case I think the indications are that it is a client issue and not a server issue. Of course, any developer knows that code can always be better optimized. Even if this is a client issue, more optimal code in your app might improve performance on those clients. Head over to SO for help with that.
Since your app works on several workstations, chances are that the slowness is due to a problem on the problem workstations.
What are the differences in computer hardware, operating system, software, and network between the computers where it works and the computers where the app doesn't work? If the computers where the app doesn't work are all on a different subnet, there might be a routing problem or high network congestion on that subnet. If they are running an older operating system or an older browser, they might not be fully compatible with the code in your app. If they are running additional background tasks or have a small amount of RAM or free disk space, address those issues and try again.
If your app does not run consistently on each machine - if it runs slowly on a machine that it previously ran quickly on - then there might be a server issue to address. In that case, check your CPU, RAM, and network usage and correlate that with your slow app performance. Your web server might be processing the app quickly, but then hit a bottleneck on delivery. You can always try it on Apache and see if that solves your problem (Apache is free and relatively easy to set up, so it's not hard to use it just as a test).
