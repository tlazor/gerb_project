This is a tedious process and I am tempted to revert to my trusty old WordPerfect which did the whole process in one pass through the printer. But for Word users without an alternative option this will achieve the same result.  There has to be a better way and I'm ready to discover it but haven't found anything so far...
The process is rather tedious compared to some other software packages which can deliver the result with a few mouse clicks.
The instructions are based heavily on and with due recognition to the MVP FAQ - http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/BookletPrinting.htm
A year or two down the road but I continue to try to find a solution.  The best I've been able to find involves a process of mirrored margins and setting a gutter before printing.  It is tedious compared to the old WordPerfect clicks I used to use.  But it does work. I'm happy to share this for all and sundry...
In particular it will require manual processing of the document through the printer. With a duplex printer it will involve passing the paper through the printer twice.
