This is just a warning and isn't stopping the execution.  It's caused when a spec file macro is attempting to run a python command prior to python getting installed in the mock chroot.
The answer was provided in the comments. Just to complete it, found the correct tornado source rpm for CentOS 7 from https://centos.pkgs.org/7/epel-x86_64/python34-tornado-4.4.2-1.el7.x86_64.rpm.html. The one that gave the error was for Fedora (the site I had used previously didn't have one for CentOS).
This is the actual problem.  Fedora has changed it's Python packaging policy since EL7.  Basically, you now have python2-$x and python3-$x versions of packages, and the unversioned python-$x name is provided by the python2-$x package.  At some point in the future this will be changed and python3-$x will provide python-$x.  The F26 tornado spec file had a requirement of python2-singledispatch, which isn't provided by anything in EL7.  One solution that could be suggested to the Fedora maintainer is to wrap the "2" in a conditional that only expands on Fedora, like this: python%{?fedora:2}-singledispatch.  That would expand to python2-singledispatch on Fedora, but python-singledispatch on CentOS, which is the desired behavior.
