Is there anything that I can do (except restarting my Windows after each document is sent to print)? Is there any way I can "clean" network "path" to printer or force my Windows to understand that printer is in fact on-line?
tl;dr Is there anything that I can do to "clean" network "path" to my printer or otherwise force my Windows 7 to recognize my printer as being on-line (which is true), while it claims that is off-line?
The situation came to the (curiosum?) point that I can print my documents via HP Connected (I'm sending them over email and printer "captures" them and prints them; unfortunately I can't select only certain pages or print both sides this way), but I can't print it directly over network.
I'm must admit that having printer with 100% ping responses that, Windows claims, is turned off, actually limits my knowledge and resolution ideas to minimum.
Actually I am able to print something only upon system start / restart (from "old" printer spool), as immediately after full system startup / "old" spool cleanup my Windows 7 starts claiming that my printer is offline.
Or to the point where after system restart printer prints documents (from "old" spool) and minute or two later it is unable to print another document:
I have Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (with all recent WU updates installed) and HP LaserJet Pro MFP M426fdn. And for past few days I have a terrible problems with printing.
