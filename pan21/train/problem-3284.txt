Viewing 1080p video on a 720p screen may cause the quality of the video to be distorted as it tries to work out where to cut pixels. Chances are it won't be noticeable, but there really is no benefit of 1080p videos over 720p while using a 720p screen.
Depends on your hardware and whether or not it does upscaling/downscaling.  Theoretically, 1080 lines compressed down to a set/monitor that can only read 720 lines (that's what 1080/720 refers to; the number of lines in your picture) should improve the image.  More is better, right?  However, let's look at a 40" TV for instance.  720 lines on a 40" TV comes to 18 lines (or pixels) per inch.  1080 lines on a 40" TV comes to 27 lines per inch.  Can your eye tell the difference with an object that small?  Probably not.  Also, you have to take into account how the video file was processed (you mentioned MKV, which is a video format created on a computer and is therefore dependant on the quality of the video card) and whether or not top-quality hardware/software was used.
So, to answer the question, most people will not notice much difference between the two videos, if at all.
