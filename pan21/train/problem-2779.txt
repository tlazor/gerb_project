If you have some money to spend for an appliance, have a look at networknightmare's WAN emulator appliances. The free solution I prefer is WANem. It comes with a nice WebGUI (easy to configure) for layer 3 operation, if you need to slow down layer 2 traffic, just create a bridged interface with two network cards.
Ive tried some free linux WAN simulators to emulate 4 hostingsites with delays and bandwidthlimits.. all just crashed with my config so i ended up setting up Qdisc manually.
Marionette may be able to help you out here, and possibly simplify your life with creating other network configurations for testing as well.
Namely, you need a WAN emulator. These pieces of software let you configure bandwidth, delay/latency and random packet loss. Therefor, you can simulate connections over slow uplinks or just see how your application performs with some delay.
Basically, you need a switch/bridge/router, which slows down your traffic. I would strongly recommend to not use a tool on client or server, but between them on your network equipment.
