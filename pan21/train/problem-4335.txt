Collided with this same problem today. Not sure why and how exactly, but the following solution worked for me just fine...

The most consistent behavior is when I click on a subfolder, it shuffles about and select Sent Items instead, which makes it almost impossible to see subfolder emails.
After using "Move Up" and "Move Down" options from the "right mouse click" drop-down menu the folder pane seem to stabilized itself and is not rearranging itself any more.
