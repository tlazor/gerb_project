Another test: Open F12 in Chrome or Opera, go to Network tab, and then go to site to see the time for each resource.
You could try running a DNS query from another ISP (say, ISP2) on the IP you get from ISP1. It is not 100% proof, but I expect a high likelihood that the query will take 30 seconds to complete. That would mean that ISP1 DNS server is having problems answering to queries from the outside.
If we suppose that the page you are connecting to does something like a DNS query on the connecting IP, and that query fails for some reason, you would see:
Another test: clear your DNS cache. It could be looking up haskell.org's IP address takes a long time. ipconfig /flushdns. Also try ping hackage.haskell.org from the command line to see how long it takes to look up the IP address.
Another test you can run is to find a resource on that sight such as HTML file, CSS file, or XML file, and pass that link to an HTML validator, etc. If the 3rd party services takes a long time to fetch, then it is a problem with the server. 
It sounds like a server issue. It loaded fast for me. To test if the server dislikes you, try accessing it from a proxy, such as TOR or HideMyAss.com. If it is fast, then there is a problem between haskell.org and your house. 
Another possible cause could be ISP1's DNS being firewalled out by Hackage for some (likely mistaken) reason (in my outfit, the reason would be "a trigger-happy netadmin", and I could name names). In that case you would have a much harder time diagnosing, for any tests through ISP2 would return nothing unusual; you'd have to escalate this to Hackage.
Problem sounds like an issue with "MTU".  If you google "windows setting mtu" you should come up with a number of responses which will show you how to test this theory, and lower your MTU as appropriate.  (If you were using a Linux router I could produce an IPTables command to do this dynamically for you, but I don't "do" Windows.)
