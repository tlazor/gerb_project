Your problem is that you have a file system entry with a name containing only a space (test\, note the space after the backslash). This is technically possible in NTFS, but is not at all permitted in Win32 and most Windows APIs will not handle it gracefully at all. They will try to strip the spaces from the ends of the file name, and then get very confused when the filename isn't there anymore and may treat it as though you're referring to the directory; this happens even if you use a format like test\* or " ".
Then reopen it and do the same thing again, this time the 'replace all child option is present' so tick that and the 'replace owner on ...' checkbox. Then click ok
At the Advanced Security Settings page you need to change to Administrators (with an s at the end otherwise you get Enum errors) and click ok because the 'replace all child ...' option is missing.
You should now be able to Edit to give permission to Administrators.  Close that menu again and you should be able to delete.
