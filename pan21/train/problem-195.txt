As to how to repair the association and re-link objects to the UML template I am not certain and sadly do not have access to Visio at the moment to try anything out, but if the line-art is intact but simply not editable you should at least be able to recover the artwork, if not the references.
You may be able to select the entire drawing, right click it, and under the Shapes menu you should see an option to Ungroup.  This should at least break the file down into lines and shapes that are editable.
I would recommend doing this on a copy of your original file, keeping the original safe in case it can be recovered.
When using a template Ungroup-ing should usually give a warning that it will break references to the template.
Does anyone else have access to the file, could they have modified it in any way?  Visio does have an option to remove hidden data and if someone went into the document, hit that button and selected the "Remove these items..." it looks like it also breaks the links to template and stencil files.  I've shown the dialog from Visio 2007 below, I would expect similar in 2010.
