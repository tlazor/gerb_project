hmm, I do know that MS Office 2003 (maybe earlier) uses SNP (snapshot) as one of its output options.  They are read by the "snapshot viewer".  It's somewhat analogous to PDF, which v2007 now uses.
What kind of NFS filers do you have?  I assume they are NetApp NFS filers.  These are backups of file changes.  This is not a bug but a HUGE feature.  You can go back in time to get any files that were changed or deleted.  The downside, you need to think about .snapshot dirs for any find commands.
.snapshot files implies to me that it is a native *nix program of sorts creating these simply because a preceding '.' means "hidden" in the *nix world, you are running a windows server though? interesting, I would see if there are any open source software that you installed recently or before as that might be your culprit. If they are constantly appearing then it is obviously a process that is running now, or a running service. so looking through your task manager should shed light on what is running that could be making these.
