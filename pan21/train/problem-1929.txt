Step Two: Go to your new computer. Install Mozilla Firefox. If you are running Windows 7 or 8/8.1 go to C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles. Under the Profiles folder you will find a profile name (normally a string of numbers and letters with .default at the end).
The only extra step is when copying a profile from Windows to Ubuntu; there's a text file listing the profiles (in ~/.mozilla/firefox/) that I updated manually.  I'm not sure if that's actually necessary.
Open Mozilla Firefox and everything will be there just like your old profile. I hope this helps you. Thanks.
Step Four: Go to your desktop and copy the name of the new computer’s Firefox profile. Next, go back to the profile folder  (C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles) on the new computer, and rename the old computer’s Firefox profile to the exact same name of the new computer’s Firefox profile. In my case, I would rename the new Firefox profile (35jar636.default ) to H9gzaar6.default .

See the official Mozilla Profile support page for how to locate the profile, as well as the official how-to for backing up and restoring a profile.
Step One: We first need to grab the Firefox profile off the old computer or hard drive. On the old computer, browse to (Windows XP) C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles; (Windows 7,8, 8.1) C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles. You will find under the Profiles folder a xxxxxx.default profile.
FEBE backs up your extensions, themes, bookmarks, preferences, passwords, cookies and just about everything else Firefox offers (it can even backup/restore your entire profile). You can selectively restore only the items you need.
Step Three: Ensure Firefox is closed on the new computer. Get your flash drive and copy the Firefox profile from the old computer into the C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles (Windows 7, 8 or 8.1) folder on the new computer.
I've always just copied the profile from one Windows user directory to the other.  Never had a problem.
I personally use XMarks, an add-on that will sync your bookmarks with a copy in your repository. You can then register multiple computers with the Xmarks account, and they will all have the same bookmarks. Note that if you bookmark a URL at work, which is not available from the net, it will not work, but you can also have different profiles, and sync based on those profiles.
