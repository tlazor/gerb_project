Please review THIS Microsoft KB article on the details involved in changing your boot drive letter (or changing it back): http://windowsitpro.com/windows-client/changing-windows-system-drive-letter
The Drive letter assigned to the operating system that you booted cannot be easily changed in windows once installation is complete.  Non-booted drive letters CAN have their letters changed, but trying to change the booted OS's drive letter after installation is dangerous and not recommended.
Yes. There will be no issues with running Windows from a different drive letter. However, many programs will often default the installation path to the C: drive. Causing you to have to type in or browse to the drive letter of Windows during each install, which for some can be annoying.
If Windows has been installed onto another drive such as D:, E:, F:, G:, H:, or I: the best suggestion is that you re-install Windows if you're wanting to change the drive letter of where Windows is located. Attempting to hack the registry or change other system settings to fix this issue often causes more issues than it fixes.
