Also, depending on whether you're using a 32 bit (x86) or 64 bit (x64) version of Windows 7 you will need to find 32 bit or 64 bit drivers.
Most laptops should work with windows 7 provides that you have the vista driver with the correct bitness (I.e. 32 or 64 bit)
Drivers are what affect compatibility. You will need to make sure you have Windows 7 drivers for all the components that require drivers. Windows 7 has very good driver support but you may need to obtain Windows 7 drivers directly from the PC maker (Dell in this case) or from manufacturers of the internal components. As @Sim has also pointed out, you may be able to use Vista drivers if you cannot find Windows 7 drivers.
What are the reasons for this incompatibility?Specifically incompatible in WLAN Card. What can I do to make it compatible.?
Is it possible that a laptop or a computer isn't compatible with windows 7 even if it has 2Gb of memory and a decent 2Ghz intel processor and the hard drive has 200Gb free space?
You should still be able to install it, you just won't be able to use said piece of equipment without the correct driver.
It is not the hardware specs that are causing the problem. Just because a computer/laptop meets certain hardware requirements does not mean it will support an operating system.
We don't know why <unknown WLAN card> doesn't work with Windows 7. Probably drivers. See if the manufacturer has an updated driver for it.
just provide the vista driver if you are asked. If it happens that you so not see the dialog asking for the drivers then go to device manager . Right click my computer / properties / you should see device manager.
