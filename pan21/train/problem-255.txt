First, the RJ45 has eight contacts for four pairs of wires. How many wires does the existing telephone cable have? Unless this cable was for a large office, it likely has only four wires, so cannot be used directly for a full-speed conection.
So in most cases, it's more economical and more efficient to snake new Cat-6A cable through the walls or dropped ceilings rather than to reuse the old cable for Ethernet. However, if you have land-line service, just reuse the cable for POTS and use a USB modem adapter (~US$20) for 56 kb/s service. A modem is also a handy way to send and receive faxes without using an internet service middleman.
Second, the cable used for plain old telephone service (POTS) was originally designed to carry signals of a few kHz. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) managed to get speeds of 250 kb/s to (rarely) 100 Mb/s over POTS, but don't expect the full speed your ISP provides over old copper.
There is discussion of POTS to Ethernet adapters. An adapter kit including transmitter, receiver and power supplies is available for ~US$220, which might be worthwhile if you want to connect points a km apart. Planet Technology has a DSL bridge for ~US$120, but you need one at each end of the cable. DSL Warehouse shows a wiring diagram.
