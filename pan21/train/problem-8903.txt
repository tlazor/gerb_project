So for those looking to make Windows recognize their USB Bluetooth dongles, try uninstalling the drivers.
Go to Device Manager (Right click on Start Menu and choose Device Manager or Search for Device Manager).
This is what I have discovered from experimenting over a long time - for windows GUI Bluetooth features to activate, there cannot be any other installed drivers or interfaces. For me in my case, windows didn't active the features until I had uninstalled the stock drivers (CSR Wireless Stack). Basically, Windows needs to be using the "Generic Bluetooth Radio" drivers for the features to be activated.
Right click, choose Uninstall and remember to choose "Delete the driver software for this device" (I tried without this and it did not work).
Find your device on the list. My device was on Universal Serial Bus Devices (I think), named CSR8510 A10.
Change the Bluetooth Handsfree Service and the Bluetooth Support Service to automatic (on properties) and start them.
After that it started to work. You may need to remove the dongle and insert it again or to restart the computer after step 2, but if I recall correctly, it started to work right after step 2 for me.
