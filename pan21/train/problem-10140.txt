It really seems like a marketing thing to me tbh. I mean Intel's stock coolers do just fine without any heat pipes. (Considering how small they are and that there are not a lot of fins.)
The heat pipes are basically pipes, to carry heat, (no duh) to the fins on your heat sink. The Heat sink increases surface area, and improves cooling and your fan, further aids the cooling. The most common type of heat pipe is copper, and usually attached to aluminum fins. Copper conducts heat better than aluminum.  
It just seems super unreasonable to me that 4,6,8 or I don't know how many heat pipes would be more efficient at transferring the heat to the aluminum fins than simply using a solid copper block. Or why not just leave it and mount the fins closer to the CPU? I mean you could still use a little bit of copper, but not these two or more inches long heat pipes..
I've been asking myself this question for probably more than 10 years now... What's the point of heat pipes? For example on a CPU cooler.
