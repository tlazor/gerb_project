I would like to configure /etc/network/interfaces so that it connects to wifi when the cable is not connected, is it possible? 
With the above configuration and cable not connected I still need to do # ifconfig eth0 down to have access the internet.
You should probably likewise get rid of the "auto wlan0" stanza and leave it with "allow-hotplug wlan0".
Your actual issue is your "auto eth0" stanza. This means that the eth0 interface will always be brought up, even if there is no cable connected - and because you have statically configured the interface, it will not time out trying to DHCP, it will just be up and any attempt to send traffic on it will fail. This is why you have to manually ifdown the interface before your system tries to use the wlan. You should only have the "allow-hotplug eth0" stanza, which will tell the system to attempt to bring up the interface only if the cable is actually connected (and also to drop it if the cable goes away). Then your system should start choosing which interface to use a bit more sensibly.
