This will make your new install the secondary though and it is not clear to me if they have limits on what the secondary can do.
Belarc Advisor is an audit tool that can do this.  Among other things, it will display many of the serial numbers on your computer, including Adobe products (at least CS2 for me). 
If you attempt to install and activate on a new computer, it may work as retail versions of most Adobe software allow for concurrent installations on a primary and secondary machine. 
Call customer support. Recovering the keys from the registry is not likely, and you'll find that you need an activation key anyway.
Moving the primary activation from one computer to another normally requires deactivation from the original install ahead of time and since you are no longer in friendly contact with the ex-employee this seems unlikely. Attempting to activate on a new machine without the deactivation will prompt a call to Adobe. 
You can, at most, delay the inevitable call to Adobe. In order to get your full rights to the software, you will almost definitely need to call at some point.
