But I found something on Internet today, I want try to run Diskpart tonight from the recovery disk in a prompt, which I can fortunately start and follow these instructions:
Power cycle the PC! Power it down, unplug from wall / remove battery if a laptop. While it's off, hold the power button for a good 15-30 seconds.
I ran Windows 7 restore disc again and then it said something about a corrupt partition and that he fixed it. But got the same msg at restart about operating system not found.
If all else fails, you should try attaching the SSD to another PC running Windows 7 and boot off of Parted Magic, http://partedmagic.com/doku.php/, and see if you can mount and extract the data.
You can boot off the Windows 7 disk, open the command prompt and running a check disk, i.e chkdsk /r C:, on the SSD. Please reference this site for step by step instructions: http://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=6565/. Also try running the Bootrec.exe utility from the command prompt while you're in the recovery environment too, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392/. I don't like the automated Windows 7 recovery tools because they never seem to work.
The Operating System seems to see itself somehow but it does not recognize itself on a valid partition. It does not load all the drivers and stop to do everything as it is in waiting for an answer from the SSD.
My concern is that when I type "list disk" or "select disk x" it will stick there as well. But I hope it will help you. If this will work, then update any firmware if you didn't before.
It just happened something similar yesterday evening. To me BIOS recognize it but Windows is stuck during the startup, even safe mode, even recovery mode, even for a new installation just before it let you choose the drive where you want install it.
I've had a SSD completely die on me where I had "Please insert valid boot device". Attaching it to another computer or using the recovery environment didn't even recognize the drive.
