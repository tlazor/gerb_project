I'd still go with #1 or #2. I'll echo Molly's comment here: try running memtest. It's likely that either #1 or #2 would cause memtest to fail in some way at some point.
On the other hand, it's easy to imagine a BIOS bug where something like a lot of RAM in an extra bank would mess up initialization somehow causing it to fail to scan SATA buses.
If this helps, it can be a power issue/motherboard bug. If not, then [3] is likely damaged: memtest it.
Isn't this motherboard supposed to max out at 1Gig modules?  You mention using a 2Gig module.  Please check your manual.
I think BlackBeagle may have it there, although the system does work when only the 2GB DIMM is in. Maybe just the mix of RAM is the problem. (ie. Not paired, CL5/CL6 mix), I'll probably take it back and get 2x1gb pair from the shop and report back progress. 
To diferentiate 'power failure' and 'MB bug' insert all the three and try moving them around: [1][2][ ][3] and so on: it might work, and point to MB issue. Note that slots order may not be important, so this proves nothing, but gives you a chance :)
Assuming you had [1] and [2] RAM modules and plugged in the [3]rd, try to remove [1] so now you have only [2][3]. 
This is almost certainly not hard disk firmware. It's not impossible to imagine firmware bugs causing this behavior, but it wouldn't be easy -- from the point of view of detection the hard drive is basically a passive device and shouldn't care a whit how much RAM is in the system.
