I'd like to know what drawbacks there are to using a netbook as an OpenBSD firewall -- and what alternatives I might wish to consider. One apparent drawback is that netbooks rarely (if ever?) have two ethernet ports, so a USB-Ethernet adapter will be required. What other pros/cons/issues ought to be considered when looking at an OpenBSD netbook firewall?
I'm considering putting OpenBSD on a netbook for use as a firewall. I am entertaining the idea of using a netbook because it has a built-in screen and keyboard, built-in battery backup, and a relatively small physical footprint. The firewall will be for a small office (i.e. <20 computers).
A serial ports gives you console access from you PC or any other laptop nearby. The footprint is lowered, but you still have easy screen+keyboard access to it (without needing to remove a keyboard/monitor from somewhere else.
Although the netbook has a battery, does the switch/router/gateway device have battery power? If not, this is one of the advantages which don't matter. Not sure I would trust what is basically your entire internet access for your office on netbook hardware. They are not build for this type of work- you only need a power supply problem/hard drive etc to fail, and you have no internet in your office.
