so in the filezilla server console search for the "passive Option", enable and set the same ports : 50100-50120 and remember to open the same range in the windows firewall. that will be working when you're done.
I also have Windows Firewall set to accept in/out bound 5000-5005 (wasn't sure if it was needed), and to allow 989/990 in.
I'm also attempting to use my MacBook Pro from outside my LAN. Using Finder, it prompts me for credentials (which wouldn't happen if it was completely rejected.)
Or maybe just enable passive mode into the ports that you have already configured 5000-5005 (TCP only)
When I try to connect using FileZilla from outside the LAN, I receive a "Failed to retrieve directory listing"
Enable the Passive mode in for ports in any range (I usually do 50100-50120) (the range will depend on the numbers of user that youll ftps will manage.
I'm trying to get Microsoft Server 2016's IIS 10 to run FTPS. I have it working internally (need to change the External IP Address of Firewall to match internal IP (for LAN) and external IP (for WAN), but it works.)
5000-5005Yes this is because along with the configuration of the port you would need also a series of ports called "Passive Mode" in ftps. So what you need to do is just to open the port 21 (for regular ftp) and 22 for ftps.
