I'm not sure how this translates to Linux (I'm sure it's somehow applicable, I'm just not sure how it translates exactly), but I was having the same problem on Mac, and I believe it was because of how I'd formatted my USB stick.  Originally I had just created a partition as FAT and was able to load many different ISOs onto the device.  Then I made a mistake and had to re-format(?) the whole device, which included re-making the file/partition table.  Originally I just chose the default "Scheme", "GUID Partition Map".  From this point on I was having trouble.  I had a hunch that it might require the "Master Boot Record" scheme, so I erased the whole USB stick again with that setting.  Then when I ran unetbootin again it worked without issue.
I've also tried a different ISO, still no joy. Both of the ISO files I know work as I've burnt them to CD and booted them on a computer.
I had the same problem and in the time it took me to find and read through all the comments on this page, 0.hfs was unpacked and the installation continued!
If I run 'sudo unetbootin' and select my ISO image (boot-rescue-32bit.iso) and select my newly formatted USB drive click ok, then unetbootin gets stuck on Extracting and Copying Files at 0%.
I've also tried a different USB flash drive and a different USB slot (on-board instead of through a USB hub)
