I have not found an option to force VLC to stop using NVIDIA settings, but you can fix the NVIDIA setting to make it look like Media-player, by going to "NVIDIA Control Panel -> Adjust video color settings -> Advanced -> Dynamic Range" and setting it to "Full (0-255)"
If the settings in VLC are identical there should be no big difference in what VLC does, thus it seems probable that the difference in video hardware is generating different results. I don't have a very solid answer for you, but I would compare the output of another player to see if the same effect is visible.
If another video player yields identical output on both machines it may still be the settings I referred to (VLC may use hardware acceleration in places where another player does not).
If another player also yields differing output, the likely culprit is video card configuration (a lot of the video processing is done in video hardware so the settings may matter). If you're not familiar, I'm referring to something like:
