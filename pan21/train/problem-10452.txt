The other way is to get free images, textures, and models from many sites on the internet. However, these aren't necessarily what you want. Option 2 is probably the best way, unless it's more of a learning project (not for release).  
Programmers art could make sure that you concentrate on the most important aspect of your game: the game itself.
Pimp your game as often as you can - concentrate of game mechanics first - then I am sure that you'll attract some artist types - maybe even for free (join the team).
There are of course places where you can grab models and art under an open license, but I would just carry on making a game if I were you.
I would recommend you to search a skinner and/or 2D Artist who is skilled and can create that kind of art. This is a good forum i remember, where like just skilled artists are grouped :)
Or, you could advertise on a site such as Gamedev's Help Wanted Forum for an artist, saying that you've created such and such a game, with your programmer art, and looking for a improvment to the graphical quality.
