Regarding the distro: About every distro should work and if you have experience with one, use this. If not, I think OpenSUSE with it's yast tool is not a bad choice because it makes many tasks (like configuring Apache) quite simple. This comes with a price though: Many things work a little bit different and Yast can interfere with any configuration you might do manually. Also, you don't really learn how to really configure services and what's happening behind the scenes. 
As far as an OS i'd check out the Turnkey solutions. LAMP setups are all packaged nicely together so that you don't have to install each individually. 
Last thing first: As long as you don't reconfigure anything else in your network, about the only pieces of software that might interfere with your network are Samba and DHCP servers. In the general case, there is only one DHCP server allowed in a network so make sure you don't install this component on your dev box. Regarding Samba, you shouldn't configure it to be a domain controller for your Windows domain and also don't let it run as WINS server or master browser.
