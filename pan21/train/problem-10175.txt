Yes, it probably is. Assuming you have a stack of machines set up solely for 1 user to RDC into... you can save a lot by hosting them all on a single server. VMWare is good choice for this, if the desktops are all very similar (even slight modifications to an image) then VMware will re-use the RAM that is shared amongst the running images. (eg you have 20 guest images all running Windows, you don't need 3GB RAM for every machine as a lot of the memory use will be duplicated - VMWare consolidates the duplicate pages so you have to use less physical RAM. Pretty neat I think).
You might like to check out creating a single guest image and then using snapshots to allow each user to modify it so they all get their own PC image, but the majority of the image is a shared single image.
You have two options really - deploy a Windows Terminal Server or use a desktop virtualization like VMware View. Does each user really use the 3GB of RAM? If so, then I'd recommend going with the VMware View option. With that solution, you'll be able to reserve all (or a large part) of that 3GB RAM for each VM that you need to run. I'm not sure that's possible with Terminal Server. You could do this on the standard (non-View) VMware infrastructure, but you'll lose some of the nice features that View would give you like automatic provisioning/deprovisioning, Master VM images, etc.
You'll still need to try it out, although I guess your developers won't notice a performance hit as they're over a slow connection, they might notice compile times drop as that uses a lot of IO, and VMs aren't the best at providing IO rates like a native machine (especially as that disk array is used by many users all at once whereas before it was 1 disk per user)(so get a good array and configure it as RAID 10).
