Set the task scheduler to say 5 mins and have it repeat for every 5 minutes for 24 hours, every day.  But of course this adds that extra load on the source server of having to scan the folder during each pass to see what has changed.  YMMV
The issues I have run into with the /MON option is that often the app writing the data doesn't finish in time before robocopy gets greedy and begins to copy it.  Of course then it will have to copy it again once the writing is completed.  Running it once and then exiting "mostly" solved the problem for me.  The contention can still happen during the run, but at least you aren't creating a race condition.  
I would use George's suggestion and do DFS-R.  It's far more efficient for this kinda stuff..  But if like me, you insist on using Robocopy, you might want to just add a single pass to the task scheduler and run it at a normal interval.  (or at login which is available in the task scheduler as well).  This way you aren't creating a console window, that if interupted, will totally hose up your copy process.  In adding it to the scheduler, you can have it simply copy over the new updates.  And the machine/VM doesn't have to be logged in to run if you save the credentials to the task (advanced properties of the task)
