I have a task scheduled every day at 3:00, on a Vista 64 machine. Most of the time it starts at 3:00:00, sometimes 2:59:59, which is fine.
The file c:\Windows\Tasks\SCHEDLGU.TXT indicates that Task Scheduler was up and running at that time (again, dates in French locale, sorry):
This person has exactly the same problem. The answer from Microsoft (destroying and recreating the task, or using another user account) wasn't very helpful to someone who would like to understand the problem.
But from time to time the task is launched at a completely arbitrary time, such as 12:50 or 18:30. Sometimes I see the task's window pop up in front of me while I work. It's very IO-intensive so there is a reason why I run it at night.
Here is an example from one month ago. It shows the task was launched at about 03:00:00 on 10/30, 11/01 and 11/02, but at 23:33:05 on 10/31. I am sorry the TaskScheduler screenshot is in French, but I have no way to change that.
I see absolutely nothing relevant in the TaskScheduler logs that may indicate why it was launched such an odd time. The machine runs 24/7 and is never rebooted except when Windows Update asks for it. It runs an extremely limited set of third-party software, my work environment consists of little more than Visual Studio and MSYS. It also runs Linux in a virtual machine that performs regular tasks (this is not really relevant but it shows that the machine never goes to sleep either).
There's also a blog post in msdn that does some analysis on a task scheduler bug that stuxnet exploited.
