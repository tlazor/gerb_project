(Although technically it does match a route: the 0.0.0.0/0 via 192.168.1.1 aka "default" route. If it didn't match any routes at all, the OS would give you a "Host unreachable" error.)
My understanding is that the gateway chosen depends on the "Destination" address that I am making a request to. Suppose I was making a request heading towards a network that did not match any routes (203.0.113.3/24, for example). In that case, doesn't this request just go to the default gateway, bypassing any address on the VPN and going straight out to the internet?
Commercial VPN providers configure their servers and/or client apps to always add a high-priority default route, since that's the whole point of their service... but there is nothing inherent in the "VPN" technologies themselves that would enforce or require this.
Many corporate or university VPNs only push specific routes relevant to the user, leaving everything else direct. (This is often called split tunneling.)
I was under the impression that, once connected to a VPN server, all outbound traffic from my computer is routed through that VPN server. I'm not a network engineer so I never really thought about it much until now.
Not necessarily. That only happens if the VPN client explicitly adds a 'default' route that goes through the VPN's interface. If the routing table doesn't say your packets go there, then they don't go there.
