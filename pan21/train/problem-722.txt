For a modestly accurate representation of physics, you need not only know the sign of the thrust, but also its total magnitude and the rotational inertia. Moreover, you might not simply want to activate all properly aligned thrusters to do a rotation.
As drawn, full power to thrusters B, D and E will maximize the rotation, but will also accelerate the ship to the right. Shutting down D will prevent this. If instead, accelerating right is intended, but a clockwise rotation is not, the most efficient way to go is enabling both C and F at two thirds of full power along with D.
If this isn't beyond the scope of what you're trying to do, you would have to write some sort of solver for the equations of motion, clearly not a simple task.
Here, F is the magnitude of the force generated by the thrusters, rx and ry are x- and y-components of the vector from pivot point to thruster. Positive torques tend to rotate the ship counter-clockwise. Using the four formulae above, it is trivial to deduce the sign of the torque each thruster produces.
The general 3D expression for torque is the cross product of displacement and force: T = r тип F. In two dimensions, a scalar value for the torque will suffice, and given only four orthogonal orientations for the thrusters, we can write in piecewise form:
