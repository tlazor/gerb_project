I've been tasked to stress test our MSSQL Server and MySQL Server. I would like to know if there are any tools or scripts which I could use on our current systems and the new system to compare performance?
You can call your own stored procs, replay traces, run TPC benchmark scripts, and more.  It's not exactly easy to use, though - thus the video.
Quest offers a free version of their Benchmark Factory that works for Oracle, SQL Server, and MySQL:
I would like to measure read / write to disk and processor performance. Anything else that may be useful would be great as well.
While it is unlikely you will run the full TPC-C at your location, the test definition should provide the foundation for developing a set of internal benchmarks designed to identify performance differences on a reference set of hardware with respect to your organization's specific requirements for transactional throughput.
The defacto standard for comparing one database solution to another is the TPC-C benchmark.   The latest definition of this benchmark can be downloaded from http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/default.asp along with existing benchmark result sets.
Make sure you download the cost of ownership documentation as well, for this can provide a standardized method for evaluating the two solutions.
