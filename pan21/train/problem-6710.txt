By following that link above, then builds, one can get to the koji build of the kf5-kio-5.90.0-2 package for that pending update: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1392448
The other two answers explain with precision what the problem is and how to build an older version while we wait for a fix.  I also found a detailed thread here for which one of the users suggests setting the KDE_DEBUG=1 environment variable.
Force installing and ignoring dependencies like this is not generally a good idea, but the -2 build here only fixes this bug from the -1 build so it's probably safe, and I've seen no problems so far.  And Fedora 29 should get the update released sooner or later, at which point dnf will update everything.
Doing this comes with other consequences I'm sure, but since I was editing my ~/.bash_profile and realized I never directed this "trick" here, thought I would post back...
 I've found that only kf5-kio-core-5.59.0-2.fc29.x86_64.rpm need be installed to fix this issue, as it contains the file.so library with the bug.  It can be installed individually, without the other RPMs from the build, via sudo rpm -Uvh kf5-kio-core-5.59.0-2.fc29.x86_64.rpm --nodeps.
I went that route since it was fast but forgot to post back, so for solidarity if you add something like this to your shell startup login file (e.g., ~/.bash_profile not ~/.bashrc):
then this will prevent you from getting this, but also ANY OTHER crash reports.  The only noticeable impact this had on my setup was that KDE_DEBUG doesn't seem to play well with high DPI screens, so I used System Settings to scale the monitor up.
