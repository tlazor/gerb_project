As a result commands are queued faster. Then the Read-Ahead setting of the Array will start populating the cache with a continuous stream of data. 
You can see that Read-Ahead with the faster command queuing is helping quite a bit, if you look at the very small percentage differences between the Random Write and Random Read events which mostly remove the Read-Ahead boost especially at the smaller chunk sizes.
It is likely that as the file is being written it is also being written as on continuous block on the disk. 
One thing the previous solutions don't take into account is the difference between how write-back and write-through commands are handled on the controller.  
Write-Back means when the controller receives a command, it immediately tells the OS handler that it was "ok", and to give the next one. Write-Though waits for each individual command to report a success before processing the next query. 
Another thing that can affect the performance is the slice size and block size for how many different heads are involved in each read or write operation.
