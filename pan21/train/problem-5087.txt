I've searched high and low for this, but have yet to find anything.  I'm running Exchange 2010, and I have a mailbox set to forward all mail to another user.  When this other user has their out of office turned on, anyone e-mailing the first user will get the response from the second user, even though they were not on the original e-mail.  I've been trying to come up with out of office rules that could make it only respond when the e-mail was sent directly, or even a different way to do the forwarding so it doesn't trigger out of office.  Anyone have any ideas?
I'd still love to hear any other better solutions, but I'm not sure if there is any other way to accomplish this.
Although the other answer would work, I found another solution that allowed my user to keep his out-of-office functionality.  I disabled the forwarding from the server between the first and second mailboxes, and instead created a rule that forwarded all incoming mail to the other user.  This makes the forwarded e-mails appear as though the first user actually forwarded the e-mail, but this means the out-of-office message will only be sent to the first user, and will only be sent once.
