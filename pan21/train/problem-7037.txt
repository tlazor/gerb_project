Also, the PC won't boot with it plugged in. It'll freeze at the "Press F2 to enter BIOS" screen, and won't resume until I unplug the dongle. Also, if I'm in the BIOS and I plug it in, it freezes up until i unplug it again. However, once booted into Windows I can unplug and plug it without freezing.
I'm using a Kinivo BTD-300 Bluetooth 3.0 USB dongle so I can use my DualShock 3 controllers wirelessly. To do this, I had to replace the original driver for the device (the Bluetooth driver that come pre-installed with Windows 10) with an ScpServer driver using a program called Zadig.
I have BTD-300 and windows 10. I was having the same issue as your with the message "USB Device Not Recognized (Code 43)". The way to fix the problem is:
I tried a System Restore from a few days ago, but now when I plug/unplug the dongle nothing happens. It doesn't show up in device manager and no notification pops up.
It was working fine for a few weeks, but after I changed the port the controllers weren't connecting properly. So I replaced the drivers again. Then when I plugged it in I got the notification saying "USB Device Not Recognized (Code 43)" no matter which port I put it in. Once in a while it would show up in "Devices" with an error code 10 (driver error).
