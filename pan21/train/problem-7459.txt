If you never explicitly create a MEMORY table, the having those two settings the same avoids confusion and discussions like this.
Intra-select tmp tables can happen often -- in every connection, and even multiple times in a single select.  So, keeping tmp_table_size "low" is important to avoid blowing out RAM.  I recommend no more than 1% of RAM, but this is rather arbitrary.
Future:  The above discussion applies to at least MySQL versions 4.0 to 5.7, plus all versions (so far) of MariaDB.  MySQL 8.0 uses a "temp table engine", which may lead to some of the above discussion being moot.
There are (if I am not mistaken) exactly 2 uses for those two settings.  They are, as alluded to in some of what you quoted:
I run pt-variable-advisor and got a note about different settings for max_heap_table_size and tmp_table_size.
Is something wrong with our (default) configuration? We don't know our workload. We run about 500 small databases for small web apps with different usage pattern.
We didn't modify the defaults from cf-mysql-release. I saw that MariaDB KB recommends other default values.
So, the admonition to make them equal is weaker than the wording you quote.  It is "sorta, kinda, oughta", and not "you MUST!".
