Oddly enough, neither site loads. I just get a Apache just serves my an empty file index page. Note that I don't have WSGIPythonPath /path/to/foo2.com/ included. I get an error when I include it. And i'm not entirely sure its needed.
So that's mainly all of it. Iv'e searched all over the internet and I could not find any solutions that are up to date. If you know of a way to solve this, please let me know. If at all possible, try to include code with your answers.
Next, enable each site using the command a2ensite, which creates a symbolic link to it in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled:
So i'll start off by explaining my goal. I have multiple domains that I am routing to a simple IP address on my server. I want Apache to route each domain to the appropriate wsgi.py file in its Django project. It seems the official Docs are written for handling one domain per server. Here they are if you want to check them Docs. I would also like to note that I don't really want to use the Django sites framework because it seems its not geared for what I need.So i'll show you what I have been trying. Iv'e placed this inside the sites-available/000-default.conf file.
Don't edit 000-default.conf. The correct way to a create site in Ubuntu is to create a new file in the directory /etc/apache2/sites-available directory that contains everything special for that particular site. For your two sites, you need to create two files, foo.com and foo2.com. Place the relevant <virtualhost *:80> ... </virtualhost> sections in their respective file.
