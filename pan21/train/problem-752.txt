What I would suggest (for a brief period only, and while you arent doing any online banking or sensitive data transactions) would be to set your home computer up as the DMZ host. This will allow all traffic sent to and from your network to be available to your computers connection, and will allow the creation of all sockets, including GRE. If this works (first removing your computer from the DMZ host status) I would check your port forwarding, network address translation rules, and firewall rules concerning vpn passthrough. 
I had an issue like this at my house, and the solution was a new router. You might try testing it out at another location (inside the work network would give you the most concrete yes/no answer as to whether it is the hardware at your house.)
It is possible to get an L2TP or SSTP connection to work behind NAT, but it takes a bit of conjuring, and configuration of certificates.
PPTP has been around since the NT4.0 days and is not necessarily the best way to create a VPN if your security is the main concern. I do use it for simple work communication and file transfer purposes, but I would not trust it to sensitive company data. (It opperates with low quality encryption, as low as 40 or 56 bit, which can easily be cracked)
There are a lot of possible problems that you could be having. If you could post your network hardware by model number that might help.
