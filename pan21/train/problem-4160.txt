The most transportable method would be a document enabled template (docm) that checked as @Akina said, the DocumentBeforeClose event.
One more that I can think of is a COM Add-in/Global Add-in that is active in all systems where the document would be used. This potentially is a logistics problem, it limits the documents use to Office versions where the add-ins can be loaded. The document would also have to be marked with a variable that can be checked in the DocumentBeforeClose routine to prevent the routine from stopping the closing of all documents. I believe that is what @harrymc is referring to.
Another solution method would be from a Macro Drive Template (dotm) attached to the document. It checks the same event as mentioned above. An inherent problem with this solution method is it requires the template always being attached and that could be a problem in some environments
The solution requires code, at either the document level, template level, or application level with a COM Add-in/Global Add-in.
