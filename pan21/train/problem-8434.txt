For fast write access everywhere in the world, Master-Master might be viable.  The long delay should not be a problem since the traffic is low.  There are many potential problems with M-M, mostly having to do with primary/unique keys, but perhaps you can resolve that.
If the operations you perform involve multiple queries (say, a few selects, then an update), there is a simple speed-up.  Combine the queries into a Stored Procedure and perform one CALL.  This cuts the trans-oceanic hops down from "multiple" to "one".  I suspect the ping time from Asia to Europe is about 200ms?  That is how much additional latency for each SQL statement.
If you only want read access, then Master-Slave will work nicely.  Anything written to the Master will incur a replication delay getting to Asia, but after that, clients in Asia can get the data with very little delay from the Asia slave.
NDB Cluster is another possibility.  However, many things are different with it, and the setup is more complex.  It relies on "eventual consistency" wherein you provide rules for what to do when conflicting data is written to different Masters.
