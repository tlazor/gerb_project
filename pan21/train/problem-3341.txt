The actual data for the round-robin is based on (i) hourly update run of the full pool (ii) authorative DNS server update the list of DNS records every 15 minutes. For the non-geographical pools a random selection is used in (ii), for the geographical pools (EU, NA, ... ) it is ranked by SRV record based on the description in http://kfwebs.com/sks-keyservers-SRV.pdf 
Yesterday, I noticed that https://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/ showed a different page on my laptop than it did on my desktop PC.
Yes, all the pools of sks-keyservers.net are set up using a DNS round-robin. In terms of reverse proxies, it require all servers to have one enabled, and if you look at the rprox column at https://sks-keyservers.net/status/ some blue flags are specifying servers with multiple servers in the backend in a clustered setup. 
It also seems that it always shows the same "server" on a given PC once it has been accessed once from there. How does it do that?
Web servers can key off information your browser sends with it's request headers, e.g., "referer" tags which indicate you clicked on a link on another site to get here, or what's most likely in this case is the User-Agent string sent by your browser.  Here's a couple examples of User-Agent strings:
The web server can use this information to display a different page if the designer made a conscious effort to do so.  So you can get a different-looking page on Chrome versus Safari, as a simple example.  But as you can see from the contents of the User-Agent strings, there's a lot of information there that a web designer can use to customize the resulting page you get back.
