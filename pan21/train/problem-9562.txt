In preference, there is Main Menu Editor use that to have Desktop Preference visible so you can change back to default right-click menus.
I'm using Debian Jessie, RasPi3. Desktop Preferences in Preferences is hidden by default. So, changing it (Show menu..) by right-clicking on the desktop you wont be able to come back to the right-click menus.
You now have multiple desktops, However, the GUI does not give any indication of this and you need to remember the keyboard shortcuts to use them: Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right will switch to the next desktop. To make this more usable do the following:
I clicked on Menu, then Preferences, then Desktop Preferences, then clicked on the "Advanced" tab, then I clicked the checkbox beside "Show menus provided by window managers when desktop is clicked", then right clicked on the desktop, went to "Desktops" and clicked on "Add new desktop".  It even lets me switch workspaces by putting your mouse on "Desktop 2" (or whatever desktop you want) and clicking "Go there..."!
This will add a panel applet to the menu bar (far right by default) that will allow you to click and switch between the desktops. 
I am aware that in many linux distributions you can setup multiple desktops or workspaces as a way of organization. I do not mean separate user accounts but one user account with multiple desktops. Is this possible in raspbian and if so how would I do it?  This is the basic idea but I would like to do it with raspbian.
