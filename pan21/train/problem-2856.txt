So I've configured all the same way as in article, requested and signed a new certificate for web-server from our domain controller CA, applied new certificate in IIS to "default web page", all worked ok, but on the next day different errors appeared: from error 500 when trying to connect owa to unable to login in ecp with admin account ( it just redirected you to broken owa), and now some users cant send mails via owa or receive it via outlook. I'm just don't know where to look.
If it persists, open IIS and check on the Application Pools to view whether MSExchangeOWAAppPool and MSExchangeECPAppPool is running on .NET Framework v2.0, and recycle virtual directory for test. Here is the similar thread about 500 error, please refer to: Unable to access OWA or ECP. - "Something went wrong" or "500 unexpected error"
Have you run iisreset as administrator in Command Prompt on Exchange servers to take effect after you binding a new certificate in IIS?
We have windows 2012R2 with Exchange 2013, we had public ssl certificate that was used both for external and internal users. We decided to not renew certificate and sign a new one with our domain controller CA.I followed this article to configure split-dns (https://practical365.com/exchange-server/avoiding-exchange-2013-server-names-ssl-certificates/)
Moreover, check into IIS log file to find any error related to MSExchange on the Exchange 2013 Client Access Server, locate the folder “c:\inetpub\logs\logfiles\W3SVC1”.
To be clear we have people that have access to exchange servers but their computers not in domain so they don't trust our new certificate.
