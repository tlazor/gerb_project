While applications can bind to particular IP adresses it's application specific. For your particular example both Chrome and Firefox support HTTP proxies.
The trick is that one launches the other browser as a different user, and policy routing rules then make all packets from that user use the other default gateway.
In this case the correct term is "Routing the traffic for a specific application in a specific way". In Linux this can be accomplished with Policy routing.
Actually the subject of the question is a bit inaccurate. Binding an application to an interface applies for an application acting as a server.
Chrome would be configured to use 127.0.0.3 as a proxy which would use 197.6.0.1 as the outgoing address.
As krowe already said it's application specific. If you application doesn't support the binding to a given interface/IP you can use iptables (Linux) or ipfilter (*BSD).
Now Firefox would be configured to connect to the proxy at 127.0.0.2 which would use 192.168.1.99 as the NIC for performing outgoing TCP requests.
