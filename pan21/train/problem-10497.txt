There is not enough information to close in on a specific issue; I suppose the port forwarding you are asking about is the one on the NAT box, and not the SSH port forwarding feature.
The other reason may be a difference in accepted encryption/key exchange protocols, in which the SSH client on box E (external to the network, being used to test) accepts encryption protocol P1, SSH server on box A accepts protocols P1 and P2, SSH client on box A accepts protocols P1 and P2 and SSH server on box B accepts protocol P2 only. In this case I believe the error message sould be different from the one in the not-able-to-connect case, but again I don't know the software involved.
If this is the case there may be at least two reasons for this behaviour; one is that box A and B have several IP addresses (say, box A is 10.1.1.50 and 192.168.0.50 and box B is 10.1.1.51 and 192.168.0.51) and the ssh connection from A to B happens on the one the ssh server on B is listening on, while the NAT box is only on the other network (the one on which the SSH server on B is not listening). This means that the SSH server on A is listening on both networks while the one on B is listening only on the network the NAT doesn't forward packets to.
