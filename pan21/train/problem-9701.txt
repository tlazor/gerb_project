How can I launch an executable so it thinks that the root directory is at a custom path, and not at the actual root. I thought it would be possible with sandbox-exec, but I haven't found any ways so far.
The general term on Unix-like operating systems to run a process with a dedicated root directory is chroot (short for "change root directory").
Assuming you have execute turned on on /tmp, that would change the root directory such that /tmp/chroot-dir becomes the new / for that process, then execute /sh within the context of that. It is possible that chroot will require you to be the root user; in that case, substitute sudo chroot for chroot. When you exit from the spawned shell, everything will be back to normal.
Consumer-oriented software generally doesn't take very well to being chrooted without significant effort, but server software can often be coaxed into a chroot with relatively little effort, and some even come with documentation on exactly what's needed.
Since /bin/sh probably needs some libraries, the specific example is likely to fail, but it will be pointing you in the right direction for what else is needed. On Linux, running ldd /bin/sh will tell you what additional libraries are required; OS X probably has something similar, if not the same thing. Non-trivial software also often needs configuration files, device nodes and other odds and ends available in its view of the file system.
