A solution that worked for me was to disable system services which I considered junk: sevices from vendors other than Microsoft that seemd not critical (ie. Java Quick Start, Google Update, Serviio, Intel services and about 10 others). I don't know which of them exactly caused the problem but after doing so my unhibernate is fast again (10 seconds). I've found this article very helpful.
So your issue is slow reading and writing to the hiberfile.sys. So check your Western Digital WD Blue WD6400AAKS for issues. Run a diag tool.
That got me this, and also a link to 'perfomance diagnostics' in the Event Viewer (none the wiser though, neither of these have been updated in the appropriate timeframe)
I had a really really slow hibernate & un-hibernate on a laptop in the past, and putting my image on a different drive fixed it completely.  Turned out that the original drive was just starting to fail.  But I would suggest just trying a disk check & defrag, and see if that helps, before going into further diagnosis.
I had the problem with slow unhibernate (6 minutes/2GB RAM) after moving system to brand new Seagate Thin SSHD 500GB on Toshiba laptop with Windows XP.
