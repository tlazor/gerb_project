Google Chrome 6 now does precisely what you asked for.  It was released yesterday (2 September 2010).
The HTTP:// string is not a prefix of the URL, it's part of the URL. Which is why you can't (and shouldn't) hide it, since the application is displaying the URL.
This is not possible with any browser that is currently shipping, even if it was, you wouldn't be able to control that setting via the javascript DOM. 
I'm guessing you're thinking something like the iPhone css tricks which scroll the page down a dozen pixels to obscure the url header. 
If you're unhappy with the browsers out there, roll your own.  Firefox and Chrome are both open-source, so most of the work is already done for you.
99% might use the HTTP protocol, but there's a lot more than 1% that use HTTP over TLS (ie HTTPS) and they're on different ports, so the browser needs to know which port to open.
The closest I can think is with a javascript driven popup, which can suggest to the browser that it should hide the url bar. However popups are very much out of vogue.
