First a quality assurance pass is needed to make sure the tasks are reasonable and completable by your internal QA. 
Instead of saying your thoughts aloud, write down what you want to say. Use this as your basis to guide your game difficulty.
Tracking player data can go a long way to making difficult tuning as objective a process as possible. How long are people staying alive, where are the taking damage or getting killed, how many tries does a section of the level take. Getting good metric data can really help your team see where people are having issues in your game.
The longer your QA staff plays the game the better they get at it, so it's good to have sessions where you grab new people who have never sat down with the game and have them go through it.
Families are a good next line if your on a budget, after that you need to bring in focus groups or outsource testing.
The next step is to use all the other internal staff you can grab for a few play-thoughs. Be sure to record as much as possible for later analysis. Sweep, iterate, repeat.
Watch someone play but don't talk to them. By not talking to them, you can see things them do things that will make you pull you hair (You: the solution is obvious. What's wrong with you? #$@!).
Now do a sweep on initial difficulty and/or level times, rinse and repeat until diminishing returns mean you need to move on.
Ensure that you change the people playtesting your game.  We shipped a title for the original PSX that was far too difficult (far too tight time limits) as we'd had all the same playtesters testing the game over the development period so they knew the levels backwards.
