The meanings of all the session variables are documented towards the end of the very comprehensive documentation. (Search for "statistics and monitoring")
HAProxy always uses weights from what I understand. If you look at your weights on the screenshot it says all of them are weight 1. Running roundrobin, we have 4 servers of weight 50 and one of weight 1. The four of weight 50 are near perfect with regard to the number of sessions (2-3 off). The server with the 1 weight is has the right amount of sessions proportionately speaking.
Try explicitly setting the weights to the same higher value. That should help it be a little more fine grained in its weight calculation which should achieve higher accuracy. If the weight is one on all of them then it deals in terms of 20% which isn't very accurate. Now if you set all 5 to weight 20 then it can deal in terms of 1%.
If you look, your A,B and E servers have ~250 current sessions open (Sessions Cur). But C+D have many times that. But because you specified "round robin", those overloaded servers get an even distribution of all new traffic.
"leastconn" allows servers to recover if they get overwhelmed. "roundrobin" keeps sending everybody traffic equally (piling on more connections to a slow server) until they fall over.
You should use the "leastconn" method instead of round robin. It uses slightly more CPU, but does better load balancing if your sessions aren't super-short.
