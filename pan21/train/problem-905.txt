And these are my Paddle and Ball class. I think I could have written some things from the Paddle class in the Ball class but I was working to make the game function so whatever worked, I stuck with.
I'm not sure if this is an appropriate post for this site as it is super lengthy and asks just for review of my code, I can take it down if this isn't the place to post!
My main class (I named it shapes because this started as a simple project where I made a square move).
I would like to change the Ball velocity to a double value so I can increment the speed by like 0.1 everytime it hits a paddle but I couldn't figure out how to make a random double value to get the initial ball velocities.
I am very new to programming still but have been learning a lot. I decided to have a go at making the game Pong from scratch, and I want to know how I could have made this more simple than I wrote it. I feel like I have wayy too many unnecessary variables and some of my code needs cleaned. I am still bad at privatizing methods when I should so most of my methods may be public or static when they shouldn't be. Also the ball in this game takes very very predictable paths so I'm not sure how I could make the ball a bit trickier to get.
