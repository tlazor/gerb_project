The raspi is not a good device for initial imaging- its underpowered, you'll need to power your drives somehow, and it'll overcomplicate things. A 'regular' desktop is what I'd use given an option
You can then mount these images with kpartx (which would mount images with more than one partition) and get the data out from there.
I am going to be making backups of about 10 hard drives, around 4 TB of data. I will be using a USB to SATA adapter and then be transferring the data to a 4tb external USB drive. I will most likely be doing this under a Linux environment running on a raspberry pi since I want the copying system to be stand alone. I know the Pi's power abilities, so I will be using a powered hub, and that shouldn't be an issue. My only question is, would it be a better idea to just make images of all 10 hard drives and then mount those images whenever I need to get data off them, or actually copy over each file to the new hard disk. The reason I thought images would be a better idea is because I have seen problems in the past in windows when dragging and dropping all of the contents of a hard disk where it will get hung up on a single file for some unknown reason and give a vague error like "could not copy file xxx", which will in turn stop the rest of the copy process. From what I understand, making an image would result in a 1 for 1 copy of the contents and doesn't pay attention to the actual data. Also the organisation of images seems nice. Are there any advantages or disadvantages of using images? Also, are there any programs that would run well under debian to do this? 
As for imaging, I tend to like gnu ddrescue for this sort of thing - it does one pass, skipping over bad sectors, and repeated passes to ensure as much data is copied as possible.
