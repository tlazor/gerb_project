What I am worried about is what is going to happen when I plug the new one? It is a different brand, so I presume the configuration file backup from the SMC will not be useful. I am not a network engineer and it will be tricky for me to reconfigure the whole network from scratch.
So, is the network going to crash? What can I take note of before replacing the routers? Is there a way to exchange the settings from the old to the new one(a general way, I do realize this could be really brand specific)?
There really isn't enough details to fully solve your problem. Is the switch currently managed? What's the current configuration like? Are you using wireless?  Is the new switch managed?
I have a small office network, around 10-15 devices. The router at present started causing problems and considering it's a 8-years-old SMC I bought a new one for replacement.
Best bet, match your configurations and install outside of business hours so you can trouble shoot any issues after it has been installed. 
Assuming both are managed,  just using the old configuration may not work as the syntax to certain functions may have changed.
