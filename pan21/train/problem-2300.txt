All the experience I have with MATLAB is in my ECE courses which involve signalling and not RaspberryPis, but if you want easy of use there are a few Python libraries you could use. 
While this question seems to have been ask without much prior research nor effort, you are going to at least have to set up a DHCP server someone on the network that these are all attached to, whether that be on their own (Have one be a Host and the rest Nodes) or on your own network with a router (that will usually have a DHCP server running). This way you can assign unique IP addresses to your nodes (Static).
I would strongly recommend DisPy since you seem to be a beginner. I found this library very easy to understand and get up and running. This would at least get you started with distributed computing across your 8 Pi's but you might have to do some research for then connecting DisPy to your MATLAB computer. E.g. connecting the host pi (or computer) could then run some python to connect MATLAB to the code running on the clustered Pi's.
