Unless you plan on giving the VM more than 4 gigs of memory, there's no need to use the 64-bit version. A 64-bit operating system can address more memory than a 32-bit operating system, but if you have less than 4 gigs available, then it doesn't matter, since a 32-bit OS can address that much. They should both give you equal performance, but some software is not available for 64-bit linux and is for 32-bit linux, so you would probably be better off with the 32-bit version.
The performance difference won't be huge except on large operations or large memory, but in general, if you would buy 64-bit hardware (what VMWare is the equivalent of here), you should use a 64-bit app.
The memory is whatever you provide the VM with, bitness has very little to do with it here (except that the 32-bit is limited to a maximum of 4 gigs).
The real issue will be speed of commands and virtualization, which is where 64-bit will give you an advantage. Using the highest bitness available on your processor for the process will not only give the flexibility to run 64-bit Ubuntu, it'll also allow you to run that using hardware virtualization instructions. I'm not sure if the 32-bit version takes advantage of them (I know it doesn't require them, though).
