I purchased a 128GB SD card for dirt cheap knowing full well that it was likely too good to be true (unfortunately, I was right...).  My first clue was that copying files to it was quite slow.  My second clue came after finding out that most of the files were corrupt after copying them.  My third clue came after I ejected the drive and reinserted it and Windows said that chkdsk needed to be run on the drive.  I ran H2testw and it seems the drive is actually only 8GB.  Whenever I try to reformat it through Windows it defaults to 128GB which leads me to believe that the drive's firmware was reprogrammed to report the larger size (is that an accurate assumption?).
I'd like to still make use of the drive, perhaps for a Raspberry Pi project or something.  What would be the best way to ensure that I only use the 8GB that actually exists?  My initial thought is to just format the drive to 8GB, but is there anything I should be concerned about with this approach (maybe something like wear leveling attempting to write to a non-existent block)?
