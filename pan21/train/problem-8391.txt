Like @storminteractive said: if you can login to the server, then there probably is no problem with the virtualisation layer. 
The machine hosts a website running on Apache 2 that is exposed to Internet. Also it runs SSHd to allow us to connect for support.
I would look into the sleep / hibernation settings of Ubuntu. As far as I know, it is possible that the server can go in a sleep mode where it is not available via http and not writing logs, but as soon as there is a ssh connection attempt, the server will wake up. This is depending on the network card settings, but have seen this already. 
To be honest if your vm would be suspended you wouldn't be able to ssh there either. Is there any firewall/rev proxy in between? If so did you try to access the site from local network?
Did you check your ESX VM logs to validate the theory? Here you have a good guide where to look for: 
This looks like the machine enters into a paused/suspended state after a while and is re-enable by just loggin in again.
I'm receiving calls from the owner of that website telling the site is unreachable. What I do to re-enable it is simply loggin-in using SSH and that's it, everything is accessible again.
Today I tried to see if the website is working and found it wasn't reachable, so I logged in to the VM, but also did a check on some logs our app registers on it, and found nothing was logged since yesterday. But after a minute logs started to be generated.
