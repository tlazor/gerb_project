I have already successfully made direct connections where I have given below info to computer 1: IP: 192.168.2.1 / SUB: 255.255.255.0 and the rest I left empty, computer 2: IP: 192.168.2.2 / SUB: 255.255.255.0 and the rest I left empty.
But if there is gateway, then put big number (like 8000) to Metric (it's under Advanced in Windows, dunno in OS X), so this gateway priority will be low, and it won't be used to route internet traffic unless there is no other gateway.
But... this is the issue here... sometimes the internet stops working on either of them because for some reason a computer started thinking the internet should come from LAN and as such ignoring the WIFI internet connection.
I would like to know how I correctly should set up the computers LAN settings so I don't get interruptions on my WIFI internet.
Eg if your wifi provides 192.168.1.0/24, configure your LAN interfaces on 10.2.0.0/24...or vice versa...
This is a common problem with multi-homed machines (IP addresses on multiple subnets). The simplest solution is to assign (unused) IP addresses from the Wi-Fi subnet to the wired connections, using the same default gateway and subnet mask. 
I would like now to directly connect those 2 computers via their Gigabit Ethernet card to provide fast file transfers between each computer because WIFI is too slow. The router is located too far to connect cables to also so I must use direct connection.
