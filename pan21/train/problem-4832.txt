I downloaded both the Java SDK x64 and the Java plugin x86 and they both run perfect side by side. My rationale between getting the 64 bit SDK is due to my thought that Minecraft would run better, and so far it has. If you are not running standalone Java applications (such as Minecraft in my instance) and wanting to improve performance you can use the same version you run in the browser.
I would read this link. The correct download for JAVA is dependent on what browser you are using.  If you are using a 32 bit browser, even though you are on a 64 bit machine, you will need the 32 bit version of Java. And obviously, if you are using a 64 bit version of your browser, you will need the 64 bit Java.
As Dabeer said, depending on the browser, but if you are running Java applications you may receive better performance running in the native 'bit' version. As far as I know, Internet Explorer x64 comes with a fresh install of Windows x64, and thus far I haven't seen an up to date 64 bit version of Firefox or Chrome.
