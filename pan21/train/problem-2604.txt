Your operating system isn't running when the computer is turned off, so Windows has to read the hardware clock in order to get an accurate time. Otherwise, the Windows clock would "stop" every time you turned off your computer. Think of it with a metaphor: You can stand there counting "one-Mississippi two-Mississippi" etc to keep track of time, but if you fall asleep then when you wake up you'll need to look at a clock in order to know what time it is then, otherwise you'd just have to pick up from where you were before and you'd be off by the amount of time you were asleep.
Some might start windows with wrong bios time, and it takes certainly long time before windows realize what to do.
Instead, you need to set a BIOS password to prevent people tampering with the BIOS time. Set an "Administration" password and that password will be necessary in order to change BIOS settings. The BIOS password can be reset by means of physically moving a jumper on the motherboard, this is one of the primary reasons that computer cases come with lock loops. If you really want to secure the machine, then you'll need to buy an inexpensive padlock and throw it through that loop. 
Some people might have bios problems related to battery which indeed resets windows time, and is not synched with NTP Server.
A service program that can run on Windows called time synch can be used, from where you can set time to synchroinze as low as each minute. As well half an hour or more.
Rather than preventing it reading the BIOS time, the easiest option would be to set a BIOS password and not disclose it to anyone who might make any changes. While there are ways around that, my guess would be that your average family member isn't going to know how to do that.
If someone is savvy enough to change the BIOS time then they will probably get around any other restrictions you might place. Consider non-technological solutions.
