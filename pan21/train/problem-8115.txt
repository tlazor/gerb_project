I'm running an LDAP authentication service (OpenLDAP with phpLdapAdmin) on a Debian box, and at the moment it's connected to a local Samba share and an instance of DokuWiki.
And, moreover, since I'm using DokuWiki, I'd like users to be able to be able to change their LDAP password through DokuWiki's password change utility - this works, but it doesn't change the Samba share password, so the user ends up confused with his/her new password working on everything except the samba fileshare, where the old password is still valid.
Everything is working fine, except that when I'm creating a new user (let's say testuser) in the correct user group (which I do with creating a new posixAccount and then adding the objectClass sambaSamAccount to it in phpLdapAdmin) I also need to log in to the server and execute
Okay, fine, this works, but I really want this to happen automatically, with the same password as I typed for the user in phpLdapAdmin.
From what I can gather, it's the sambaNTPassword attribute that controls this, isn't there a way to control this from phpLdapAdmin?? I.e. make the change to the posixAccount password also change the samba password.
