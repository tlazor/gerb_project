I've done this, although it was running on a Micro (or possibly a Small) instance, and was only for 2 users so I could do some browser-based testing for a CI project.
In the end we canned the idea after a month, because it was insanely expensive.  The end result was buying a Dell R520 and hosting it in Colo.
I was looking at the AWS pricing guide and it seems very impractical to do this.  For even a small-medium deployment (say 15 users), I would assume I need at least 32 GB of RAM (2GB each + the OS).  This is assuming they are just running programs like Outlook and Browsers as  I see many users are able to use this easily.
This would mean I would need a Quadruple High Memory instance @ ~$2/hr.  This comes out to 1468.8 per month.
Has anyone ever done an a terminal services AWS deployment for RDP thin clients?  If so what was your experience like (plan, number of users, what they did, issues, etc.).
Yes, people have run Terminal Servers on AWS. You don't need that much RAM for your intended user count. Security, performance and cost are the main reasons it's not a common solution.
