I'm new to this, so please be gentle.  I'm looking at ways for automation without having to jump into learning curves of separate software packages.  I'm thinking this is is something that BIOS should/could currently handle. 
RHEL network installation chapter shows a minimal configuration of DCHP, TFTP, and file shares to make it go. 
A trendy term that may help guide your search is Zero Touch Provisioning. It is more common on network gear, often with some kind of cloud based controller service from the vendor.  Think branch office with no network engineer, ship a WAN device direct and plug it in.
Is there a way, with the default BIOS interface on current Supermicro servers, to automatically install a network-provided OS (FreeBSD, CentOS, etc.) image, coupled with a specific config file that provides machine-name, nework info (static IP, router IP, etc.), and the sort?  It would be advantageous to have the machine self-configure upon hookup to the LAN.  Basically a blank box introduction and setup to the level I wish.  
Out of the box, your typical x86 server has out of band management with BMC capability, but no idea how to configure itself. You can attach an iso as a DVD and drive an installer manually.  Network boot requires some kind of controller to assign an IP address and serve the install media.
