Unfortunately you are not T-mobile USA's customer and your users while customers of T-mobile USA are just end users on "we gaurantee nothing" contracts. If T-Mobile have not fixed the issue then I doubt there is anything you or your users can do to force them too.
The IANA and the RIRs tried to hold back the ranges that were being widely abused for as long as possible but eventually we reached the point where they were the only ranges left to allocate. They have been trying to put pressure on carriers that misuse these addresses but afaict they have no legal power to force them to fix it.
If you are in the USA it might be worth complaining to the FCC about issues like this, they probablly won't do anything for a single complaint but if they get enough complaints they may consider regulatory action, or they may not.
Also if you haven't already done so you should enable IPv6 for your services. This won't completely solve the problem but it will mitigate it to some extent.
Afaict there is no law that protects against such IP abuse where providers use public addresses they do not own as-if they were private.
Disclaimer: I don't know if this is still an issue, I am not a T-Mobile user and the newest posts about this are a couple of years old. Even if they have fixed it this post may be useful in dealing with other carriers.
