Unless you need clustering, more RAM than the Standard Edition x64 supports, the 4 virtual instances or to install an Enterprise Certificate Authority with Editable Templates, stick with Standard.
We are migrating from a series of old Linux servers to W2K8, and are wondering if it makes sense to spend the extra money on the Enterprise version or just stick with standard.  We run a small data center (8 servers) with manual failover and basic script based mirroring.  We will have 3 web servers and 2 database servers.  There is no current need for instant failover between servers, and I don't anticipate our company growing beyond ~200 employees within the next 10 years (we're at 50 now).
I remember that you explicitly could not set up automatically-renewing domain certificates (for EFS and cert-signed email) on a 2003 Standard server, the features were NOT available unless you set up a 2003 Enterprise box to be your CA.
Enterprise also covers 4 virtual machines on the physical host. With 2003, Enterprise allowed the 4 virtual instances using any virtualisation solution, for 2008 I'm not sure whether they have to exist under Hyper-V or if you could use something else, i.e. VMWare/etc.
You dont need the Enterprise Edition just because you're an Enterprise (you'd be surprised how many think they do).
