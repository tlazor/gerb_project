When the monit changes to unmonitor certain process, the status changes to "not monitored" and the monit daemon will NEVER try to start the monitoring of this process again even when the PID file is updated with new correct PID and the monitoring STOPS for this process forever unless the monit daemon is awakened for this process again manually like below. 
I am seeing a problem with monit config in configuring the monit daemon to awaken every few hours and start monitoring the processes which were set to "Not Monitored" state. 
For some reason, if the PID file is NOT populated correctly (I am working on fixing it), monit keeps trying to restart the process using the empty pid file throwing the below errors in the monit log and finally "unmonitor" it after it fails to restart within 3 cycles as we configured.
Can this awakening daemon for each process be configured at certain timeout intervals in the monit config for this process, to avoid of pitfalls of ending up with process going to "not monitored" state forever?
