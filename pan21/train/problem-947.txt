You might try leaving open the Details tab in Task Manager, ordering by CPU usage, and change Update speed to High to help find the nuisance process.
But on both machines a "busy" circle intermittently flashes next to my mouse cursor.  On the Windows 10 machine, if I have no foreground activity, it's at least once every six seconds.  Just for an instant it goes from regular pointer to this:
But I might be happier if I could, for example, replace the "background busy" cursor with the standard cursor so I never see it.  (I.e., "OK, computer, I get that you've got a lot going on.  Just keep it to yourself; I'm trying to work here!")
You might want to pick (or create) a cursor that is identical to the standard, but with a few pixels different, to give you some indication that the machine is a bit busy.
But I don't care so much why the O/S is flashing that cursor at me with irritating regularity; I just want to stop seeing it because it has become extremely distracting.
I work on both a new Windows 10 machine (i7-7700) and a 7-year-old machine running Windows 7 (i3-3225).  Both have 16GB RAM, SSD primary drives, and task manager shows plenty of CPU and memory free.
