Windows 7 Aero is known to give lots of trouble when using RDP especially if you have several physical monitors on your remote computer. Try to solve the problem by doing 
Try to install cygwin and, when necessary, do ssh to your remote W7 machine, do this maintenance and then RDP. 
Often, you would prefer NOT to have Aero running while connecting to the machine from outside, so just do 
When I remote access into my PC, it disables Windows Aero. That's fine, I have no issue there. However, when I end the remote access, it should (and typically does) return me back to my advanced features. However, on these two occasions it decided not to give me back my glass transparency. I restart to no avail. I run the "Find and fix problems with transparency and other visual effects" where I find that I have a process running in the background that I must kill first. However, I've closed out LogMeIn, TeamViewer and Input Director (just for good measure) and it still says something is running. I've checked processes but I see nothing immediately prominent that would indicate said process. Services tab, LogMeIn is stopped, but TeamViewer is still active but I am also unable to stop this, provided this is the issue.
I recall going into safe mode last time this happened but I was still unable to resolve it (not include the fact that safe mode doesn't support Aero to begin with). The only way I've discovered how to solve this is to do a system restore to a previous date, but that can be a pain. Is there a simple registry switch I can change to fix this? Thanks!
