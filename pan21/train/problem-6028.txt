Can I set up a domain controller with AD etc on a separate box or vm and boot it only when I need it's services? If I did that, what would happen I boot my main windows 7 box and don't have the 2008 server running? Would it boot up minus any ability to network to other machines, which I do on a regular basis? I could join and unjoin the domain if it's booted, I suppose. I don't think that'd involve a reboot of the joining pc?
I develop software on a window 7 workstation. It's the only machine that is sure to be powered on during the day. I have some pcs and virtualbox vms that run windows 2008 r2 for testing but none are regularly powered on and none act as domain controls etc.
As you can see this is an area that I have only very light exposure to, and while I could and will experiment with options, it'd be really cool if someone could tell me if this is a well known scenario and there is a pattern that it not too onerous to implement for a network newb.
It would be ideal to boot a virtualbox vm with a domain controller at my main workstations boot time and have it in action all the time but I think that is hard to set up. I could config and run one of the physical servers as a dc but I don't want an extra machine on all day when I'd only need it's services occasionally. 
Working in what I guess is still termed a workgroup mode, where each pc more or less maintains it's own login credentials works for me most of the time. I can connect and share files as needed. But sometimes I would like to use AD etc like most of my client's networks do, just to make sure things work as expected.
