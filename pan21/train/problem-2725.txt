My preferred way to identify the components in your machine, and their relevant drivers, is to do the following. Note, you will need a machine that can connect to the internet and a way to transfer at least a network driver.
Now, this won't work for some obscure devices quite so easily (although it often helps identify those obscure devices you'd otherwise have no idea about). Also if it's a machine from an OEM, there may be certain devices that only work correctly with a download from the OEM's website. There can also be custom drivers for various ACPI components, custom buttons etc. that will only be found here. Additionally, some USB devices won't be as easy to identify, and won't necessarily have a VEN and DEV id. Instead, you'll get a VID and PID, which can still give some information when looked up.
Usually, I will start with either the Wireless or Ethernet driver, to make the rest of the process a lot simpler.
It sounds like you may have the incorrect driver for your network connection causing various other issues.
