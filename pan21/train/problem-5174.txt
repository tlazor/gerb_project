If an SSD doesn't support SMART, it hopefully supports some more powerful and hardware-specific mechanism of getting this sort of information. It really should still support SMART so that it integrates with standard tools better.
The Intel models definitely do, and the Supertalent models don't (or at least, the ones i've seen - duradrive and ultradrive).  
If you can't get this data from your SSD at all, I wouldn't trust it. There are a lot of very poor SSDs on the market, and one that gives you no information about its health is very suspect. Not knowing how many blocks have failed is pretty dangerous. Treat such an SSD as a toy and nothing more.
Somewhat amusingly, the Intel X25-E drive still reports the "spin up time" and "start/stop count" SMART attributes, even though these are never updated and have no practical relevance for non-spinning media. 
But if it's relevant to have it on an SSD, from my point of view I'll say yes whether SSD is kind of protected for "mecanical" failure, flash chip can also become bad with time. Actually I think this technology is still to young to have a great ideas about the frequency of failure, but MTBF are way higher on SSD than on standard HD.
