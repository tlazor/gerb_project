ssh to squid proxy (HTTP/SSL Proxy) : The following line will also start the ssh client and connect to username@remote_machine.com. Port 8080 on localhost (127.0.0.1) on the current machine will listen for requests and ssh tunnel them to the remote machine. On the remote machine ssh will forward the packets to localhost port 3128. If squid is listening on localhost port 3128 on the remote machine then all requests sent though the ssh tunnel will then be forwarded to squid. 
Also all my traffic goes through a proxy 192.168.53.105 where I guess there is a firewall which actually blocks gmail access based on IP (this is a guess) 
I am inside a network where my machine (IP-192.168.4.53) dont have access to Gmail. But I have access to another machine with IP (192.168.4.33/24) through which Gmail is accessible. Now what I want to achieve is redirect all my http traffic through that system. Will I be able to do this using IPTables? I have tried and failed  but I dont know why I am sure this can be done. 
Why don't you try SSH tunneling since you mentioned you have access to another machine which has proper access to internet
Don't route your web traffic through your buddy's PC. If you aren't supposed to go to Gmail, don't go there. If that's not the issue, have the network team allow access for your IP.
ssh and direct connect (SOCKS5) : The following line will start the ssh client and connect to username@remote_machine.com. Port 8080 on localhost (127.0.0.1) will listen for requests and send them to the remote machine. The remote machine will then send the packets out as if they originated from itself. Now all you have to do is set the preference in Firefox/chrome/your browser choice to use a SOCKS proxy. The proxy is, of course, “localhost”, with the port 8080.
