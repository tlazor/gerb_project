I then loaded Clover from the flash drive and in the info I have EFI Revision 2.50 and my Firmware is CLOVER Rev 3354. The USB is formatted as MBR and my hard drive is is GPT.
A version-2.0 EFI is unlikely to work well with an EFI shell version 2; you're likely to need a version-1 EFI shell. This could be the source of your problem, but I can't be sure of that. The Arch Linux wiki has some handy download links for several EFI shell variants:
So I recently found out I had EFI instead of BIOS and went to experiment with different .efi programs to see which one I would want for full functionality. From 3 bootloaders I have used, I get the error ASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status = Device Error) and have tried everything to get into a shell. I can get into a UEFI shell using Clover from a flash drive but that is inconvenient. With Clover still one of my options on my Hard Drive it shows that I have EFI Revision 2.0 and Firmware Phoenix Technologies rev 3354.
I'm just trying to find out how to get into a not-too-outdated EFI shell. Every download I've used has given me the ASSERT_EFI_ERROR (Status = Device Error) .
Depending on what boot manager you're using, the ideal location and filename for an EFI shell binary varies. You may also need to explicitly create an entry for an EFI shell much like you'd need for an OS. If Clover remains like its rEFIt ancestor, it will look in EFI/tools on the ESP for an EFI shell binary. My own rEFInd (another rEFIt fork) also looks there. With rEFInd, it should be called shellx64.efi or shell.efi (on x86-64/AMD64/x64 systems). I don't recall offhand if rEFIt used both of those names or just shell.efi.
