Once the issue is resolved, change all of your passwords and tighten down your antivirus.  Most AV software offers the ability to set custom rules for firewall traffic.
Open your Local Area Connection properties, click the advanced tab, then click settings.  CLick the advance tab there, then under Security Logging, click settings.
At one stage 3 weeks ago, I'd been convinced it was a virus or something and couldn't find any infections, so I re-installed my computer completely... The guy who'd been hassling me then owned up, and, to my knowledge, hasn't done it again (he's still my prime suspect though, but I can't prove anything).
At this point, I'd like to be able to trace the shutdown request back to it's source, terminate the shutdown request after it's been executed, or completely block all incoming requests on my firewall (except from applications like Outlook, and web browsers), while allowing outgoing requests to pass through at the same time.
For weeks now there's been someone on the company network that thinks it's funny to shut down my computer remotely. All I can say is thank GOD for file recovery otherwise I'd have lost 3 projects worth of code by now.
I think there are many solutions to this problem.  Instead of blocking all incoming connections, which will probably hinder your work, try to see what port he is connecting on.
I log both dropped packets and successful connections and save the file to my desktop.  It will update constantly.  Once your machine is tampered with again, you should have some information in that log file that will help you.
