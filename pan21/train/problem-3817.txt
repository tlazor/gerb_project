Switch is an SG200-50, poor on out-of-band management facilities and cli, so, for now, not much to see except under web interface...already disabled zero-DNS servics like Bonjour.....
Quick Rawcap trace and trace analysis with Wireshark shows TCP Zero Window errors which clearly explain the significant drop on TCP throughput...
Machines used for testing were Windows XP (client) > Windows XP (server)...all NICs have auto in terms of negotiation and reporting pre-negotiated speed of lan link at 1 Gbps...no mdix errors or up/downs shown on syslog...
Started troubleshooting using iperf, having set window size to 65K...Just to cross-check i used pathtest using the same window size...Both report speeds below 10 Mbps (!) which surely are unacceptable, considering a logical transfer rate would be at around 1/4 of the Gpbs connection when PCI NIC's are used and in terms of in-memory transfers...
UDP tests, on the other hand, from both iperf and smokeping report speeds between 300-400 Mbps and as far as reading and writing using LanSpeed i get a respective 55-65 Mbps and 20 Mbps...
