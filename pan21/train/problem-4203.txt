Please also be aware there is a file /etc/host.conf on most modern Linux systems I have seen which controls the order by which a domain name is resolved; the defaults I have seen are
where the hosts file is used before any DNS lookup. Thus, it is important to be careful what hosts you put in /etc/hosts, as they will never look at DNS. 
the other line that you set in this file have precedence in DNS resolution,your server before query a DNS Server look at this file /etc/host for resolve FQDN in IP address, therefore edit carefully this file.
The first line is the loopback, that is, referring back to your own server. This is intrinsic to every computer system.
You want to have both lines in the file. You can even have more lines similar to the second one, one for each domain being served.
The second line is to establish which IP the server has been assigned, and which domain the server should serve.
As an example, I've seen it where someone puts an entry for host FOO in the /etc/hosts file. Some months or years later when DNS is changed for FOO they wonder why said machine can't reach FOO. The problem was the hardcoded entry in /etc/hosts.
