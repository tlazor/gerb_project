After reading this article, I'm properly paranoid that Linux is storing passwords on my disk somewhere that I'm not aware of. As a person with an above average preference for privacy, I don't tend to save anything beyond WEP keys, and it's a little distressing to think that they might be on my disk waiting for someone to just snatch in plaintext.
Just to make clear, Linux doesn't store ANY passwords at all in plaintext... programs from developers might, but this is no different than on Windows.
I think the article is referring to the fact that your clear-text password may be in memory at any given time, and therefore could be found on the disk.
Assuming that the attacker doesn't have access to your system with the necessary permissions to read raw disk devices (/dev/sda and the like), and that he/she doesn't have physical access to the disks, I don't think it'd be much of a concern. As chris pointed out, the problem discussed in the article (with reference to Linux and plain-text passwords specifically) is that a password which is stored in RAM as cleartext (as it necessarily must be at some point*) could be part of a page that gets swapped out to the disk, and thus it could wind up being readable from the free space on the disk. But Linux uses separate partitions, i.e. physically disjoint parts of the disk, for swap space and file storage (unless you've configured the system to use a swap file), so an attacker who can access the disk only through the filesystem wouldn't be able to get at the part of the disk that holds swapped-out data.
If you want to check for passwords being stored on disk, in readable files, in the clear, I'd take a look at things like your web browser's password manager, and the configuration files for any programs you ever enter passwords into.
But practically, there are a lot more much simpler ways to steal your password.  Unless you have something worth the effort, then you're probably safe.
