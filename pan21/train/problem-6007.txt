Also, if the intent is to provide a convenience service to the public, it may be better to not have encryption, as it's clear signal that you, the end user, are responsible for securing your transmissions and not the access point operator.
Don't mistake a password being required to connect to WIFI with a secure network, there is nothing secure about it.  If someone knows the password they can compromise the network and machines on it (assuming they are running something vulnerable).  Even if they don't know the password it is often easy enough to break it.
An open network requires no password to access, and no need to maintain or give out a password, making it simpler to operate.
It seems like a network is considered to be secure by OS(or at least Windows) when the network has a password.
It may be a cultural thing as well.  Here (in New Zealand), it is common place for places to have passwords on the WIFI which they give to their clients.
Can't public places just put WPA2 password on the network and tell people to use the password instead of just making unsecured hotspots? In that case, hackers can still get in the network but the data is encrypted, isn't it?
That said, having a password creates an artificial barrier to entry.  There is a business model around a "catch and release" type system where you are allowed access to the network through a captive portal, which has adverts of the sponsors.
Actually, most WiFi hotspots are more secure than you think. AP isolation is commonplace and millions of web servers and applications deploy ssh/tls to secure endpoints. This means that locally you have no access to other hosts on the network and remotely your connections are fully encrypted. Try to scan your subnet and you will see that this the case for most spots.
