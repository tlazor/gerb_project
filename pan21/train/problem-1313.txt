On WordPress.org they mention BlueHost, DreamHost and some others, however these are (I assume) paid featured hosts, so although I would like to support WordPress.org, I don't trust these commercials.
I use Hostmonster.com  .  It has the newest version of cPanel Pro  and it has the latest version of many of the most popular web softwares, including WordPress.    They charge $5.95 a month for UNLIMITED space and bandwidth.   Also, they have Live Chat with support on their site so you can easily ask questions about the service.   http://www.hostmonster.com/
I recently started a WordPress blog on MyDomain (which offers WordPress auto-installation). Being a newbie to hosted blogging, I prefer using a host service that will have WordPress auto-installation. 
Eventually I chose JustHost that were quite cheap and recommended by WordPress.org. Meanwhile everything is okay, thanks for all the answers.
I'm considering switching a hosting service to get better WordPress service. Is there any service that "plays nicely" with auto-installed WordPress out of the box?
