With eBGP it is a little different. You normally want to configure eBGP on the connecting interface so that BGP does notice when the link goes down. Also, eBGP can't use a different interface unless you configure ebgp multihop. Your ISP may not even want you to do that because they don't want BGP updates flowing around inside its network to get to the other router. Likely, your ISP is not configuring that way, and if the interface is down on the ISP router, you couldn't get to it for updates, anyway.
Method of peering using a loopback interface is useful since it will not bring down the BGP session when there are multiple paths between the BGP peers, which would otherwise result in tearing down the BGP session if the physical interface used for establishing the session goes down. In addition to that, it also allows the routers running BGP with multiple links between them to load balance over the available paths. 
You want to configure iBGP with loopback sources because you will probably have multiple ways for traffic to get into the router, and the loopback never goes down. That means that the router can keep sending and receiving updates. Also, iBGP requires a full mesh, and an interface or link going down could break that unless you have it source from a loopback.
