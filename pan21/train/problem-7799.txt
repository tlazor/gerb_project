Output of ifconfig -a shows an ethernet interface and an external USB WiFi adapter, but their identifiers are something like enx{Mac}, wln{Mac}. But wlan0 is just fine.
Everything was good, until I realised I could no longer use other interfaces over my pi. I have no idea why and how this has happened, but earlier I used to connect my pi to my laptop via an ethernet cable and use RDP to work on it. But now I'm unable to access any networking interface on my pi. Even if I plug in an external WiFi adapter (USB) it doesn't seem to detect. 
I have prepared a fresh SD card with the same operating system (both run the latest raspbian stretch), and in that everything works just fine. 
When I remove all of these configuration information from the /etc/network/interfaces file and simply leave it as was default, the interfaces work, but now have interface identifiers followed by Mac addresses. For eg, ethernet interface comes up as enx{Mac}. Wlan0 is fine, but when I insert the external WiFi adapter it shows as wln{Mac}.
