i dont know if it is possible to order and use more than 1 IP per EC2-instance; if so, you could simply route that IPs onto your single ssl-offloader/loadbalancer, avoiding the SNI-problem. 
Are you proposing this instead of the ELBs or in addition to them? Separation of web servers and app servers to have benefits, as it can be handy to scale independently. This of course adds another maintenance overhead that might not be worth it for 3 sites (that aren't often under heavy load). I wouldn't suggest rushing down this path until you know you're going to need it.
you could, but this really depends on what you are using nginx for; if it is just dump proxy_pass, then centralization might be ok and you could simplify your setup a lot by reducing some layers. but this can only be answered when actually looking at your live-setup. 
ELBs are an added expense, (something like $20 per month, plus data) so you should take this into consideration. What features are you using? If you're just after SSL termination you could probably just offload that onto your web/app servers.
If you're getting benefit out of the load balancing and scale features (along with zero maintenance) then you might consider it a worthwhile investment.
you could use 1 ELB (or 2, in an active-standby-scenario) if you could make sure that ALL of you visitors are using SNI-aware browsers (see this doc about issues with SNI, e.g., with Windows XP, Android 2.x etc) otherwise you'll need 1 public IP for each ssl-certificate.
1 ELB per domain might be costly for 100 sites, but for only 3 sites it's probably a nice thing to not have to worry about the maintenance overhead.
