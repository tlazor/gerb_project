So I'm stumped, how is it possible to create a directory on a Windows machine which System can't even remove? Without having a handle on it.
At some point I was trying to remove the firefox extensions Kaspersky automatically adds (running KIS 2013). Not because they were slowing my browser down, they weren't being loaded anyway (version incompatibility issue), but because I like to keep my browser clean. 
The folder properties say that SYSTEM and the local Administrators have all rights, CREATOR has none and SYSTEM is the owner. I also tried to take ownership of the folder and I tried to give myself permission, neither worked and returned with another Access Denied.
The extensions seem to be "global" so I figured I could try removing the directory they are in. Which turned out to be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2013\FFExt".
The fact that removing the directory may or may not actually get the extensions removed from my browser is beside the point. It's just to give some context.
When I tried to remove it, I got an Access Denied, so I shut down Kaspersky and tried again, same result. Then I looked at the permissions and it turned out System is the owner. So I started a cmd and did "psexec -s -i cmd" to get a cmd as system, but same result. The folder nor the files are being locked by another process (checked with Process Explorer).
