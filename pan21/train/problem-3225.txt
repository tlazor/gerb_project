You don't need any more complex collision boxes or collision shapes, unless you're doing it very high res, but even then it's most likely hardly noticeable. Keep in mind that the games you've mentioned all worked on classic systems that had only a limited amount of computation power, so pretty much all of them will only utilize simple collision shapes and only in some very rare examples (like brawlers) anything more complex.
Instead, just play the attack animation and pick one specific frame where you're looking for collisions inside a specific area.
I'm not 100% sure how the actual games implemented their collisions, but at least for the Zelda games I'm sure you've got two or three different rectangles (the first frame might not have one, never bothered testing).
Since I assume the overall attack animation will be rather short/fast, there shouldn't be any way to notice any difference.
In a similar way, the classic Castlevania games only used two rectangles during the attack animation (first behind the player while swinging the whip, then one in front for the actual attack).
It's been a while since I've played secret of mana, but again I'm rather sure they just use simple rectangles for this, nothing complex. This is obvious with longer range weapons like the spear or whip: You're often able to hit enemies despite there being no clear collision between the graphics and the enemies.
For example, the Gameboy Zeldas had like 3 frames for their sword attacks, which is all you need. If you're going for those three frames (sword horizontal, sword diagonal, sword vertical), do the collision check in the second frame and you should be fine. Once the sword is pulled, you can use another simple rectangle that's active while the sword is out.
