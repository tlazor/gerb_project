On Ubuntu, the tabname updating code is directly in $PS1; it gets prepended to the already set value of $PS1 by ~/.bashrc.  This can be reverted and the tabname set in one command by running:
Using the command line argument, echo -ne "\e]1;tab title\a" doesn't help. It does switch (Slow enough to notice the title change on the screen), but when the command exits, the title is back where it used to be: myusername@mymacname: /my/location/in/my/mac/filesystem.
Specifically, I'm running multiple vagrant boxes on my local machine and I keep tabs open to several of them.  I want to easily set the tab name to the OS version of the vagrant box, and have it stay that way.  I keep the tabs open for a long time, so I don't mind setting the name manually, but it needs to not be reset back automatically.
before you ssh does the trick, because the default initialization files (bashrc etc) look at the terminal variable and only change the title if the terminal is xterm (which nowadays is the de facto standard).
On CentOS 6, the tabname updating code gets placed in $PROMPTNAME.  It can be neutralized and the tabname set in one command by running:
Ideally, I would like the tab titles to NEVER switch automatically, including when I ssh into another server. If that's not possible, I'd like to return to the previous behavior: as long as I'm on the local machine, keep the tab titles I set. Can that be done?
Also, since these are vagrant boxes, I don't want to change settings on them that I will have to change again later if I vagrant destroy.
Note: with this trick you lose at least "alternate screen", colors and maybe other kinds of fancy terminal features you may or may not appreciate.
After switching to using .bashrc instead of .bash_profile (I didn't like how the default terminal worked with one config file and utilities like screen with another), the behavior of iterm2 changed. Before, when I set the tab titles manually, they would remain there unless I ssh'd into another server, at which point the title would change to username@otherservername: /location/in/other/servers/filesystem. Now, when I change the tab titles, they remain so until the first command I execute in that tab. As soon as I run something, the tab title switches to myusername@mymacname: /my/location/in/my/mac/filesystem.
