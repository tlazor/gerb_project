The AM2 socket has 940 contacts while the AM3 socket has 941, but otherwise, the arrangement of contacts is the same. AM3 CPUs have only 938 contacts and can be used in AM2 and AM2+ sockets (assuming a BIOS update) because they were made to be backward-compatible. AM2 CPUs do not work in an AM3 system because they do not have the newer controllers.
Intel on the other hand changes greatly with newer version. The socket 775 has 775 contacts while the socket 1155 has 1155 contacts. As you can see below, they are completely physically incompatible. In fact, even socket 1156 is incompatible with the (newer) socket 1155.
NO they will not. AMD has released some chips that used the same physical socket with different specs that were sometimes compatible depending on chipset, cpu, and bios support. 
No.  The physical socket is dramatically different. See here and here.  So is all the underlying componentry to support the CPU.
No, they are entirely incompatable pin outs - intel doesn't have backward compatibility between socket types - the 1155 has , well 1155 contacts and the 775 has 775 contacts, even if they have the same processor dimensions. It simply will not work.
