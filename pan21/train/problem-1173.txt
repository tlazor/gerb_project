The basic differente between MyISAM and InnoDB is that the later can use transactions for atomic changes to the database.  MyISAM is usually faster for simpler tables but it shouldn't be a problem with your setup.  Have you created the right indexes on the table to make updates faster?
Shouldn't matter, not for small scale databases anyway. I would recommend MyISAM as it is  simpler to administer and takes up a little less memory. It doesn't have as many advanced features as InnoDB but with what you're doing it really doesn't matter.
I suspect that you have two problems that are not dependent on table type: the main one is indexing and the other is memory.
1) If you have a unique 'ID' column in a table make sure you index it and that it is set as "unique". Also, you  should try to have indexes on any column that you use in a 'WHERE' clause. For example, if you search for a user name (e.g. SELECT * FROM userdetails WHERE username='harry';) then you should put a secondary index on the 'username' column. 
Is it slow if you go direct to the MYSQL DB and run the query? (either from commandline mysql tools or using a GUI like SQLYog)
We may be trying to solve a MySQL problem when the DB is fine and the performance bottleneck lies elsewhere; from your description the query is very basic and should be quick even without optimisation.
2) Memory -- are you running on shared hosting or a VPS? it is possible that you're running out of RAM? Try going up to at least 256mb RAM.
