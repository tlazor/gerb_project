The computer hasn't frozen, Bitlocker is shown as running in Task Manager and the CPU is at a steady 5%. 
I anticipated the decryption taking a long time but after an hour the decryption hasn't even started. Instead my computer is stuck on the same screen, with no progress bar, percentage or pause button. Apparently I need 10 reputation to post an image, which isn't terribly helpful. All I can see if the standard Control Panel bitlocker screen and under C: it simply says 'Decrypting'. I cannot see the additional floating window that shows progress.
On attempting the install I was informed I would need to disable Bitlocker. I suspended bitlocker and backed up the key to a USB stick, removed the stick and then decided to decrypt the drive as well as I want a complete fresh start with this computer.
So what do I do? How long should I wait for the process to start. I don't want to corrupt the drive by having it semi decrypted but I can't even tell if it has started.
I was about to do a fresh install of Windows 7 64bit on a laptop currently running Windows 7 32 bit with a Bitlocker encrypted 232GB hard-drive with 1.54GB free. I have already backed up all the data on the hard drive to another location.
