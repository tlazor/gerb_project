If you have access to the servers to make configuration changes ( since you host the servers) then you can configure it so that you can access your servers via a web browser (preferably Internet Explorer since it's a Windows server) .

If a company uses a web proxy server, they also usually open ports 80 and 443 through the proxy server.
