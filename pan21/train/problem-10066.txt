I recently had an occasion to reinstall my Win 7 computer from the initial DVD.  I did not have any problems in the activation process and I used the original product key (from the manufacturer sticker on my machine).  So therefore, I say YES that information is sufficient.
The most reliable way would be to locate the Windows Product Key sticker.  Normally this is located on the bottom of a laptop, or on the top or back of a desktop.  If you are unable to find the sticker on your laptop, it may be under the battery.
The product ID in your screenshot is derived from that key, and you might get lucky and convince a human operator to give you the right key based on that. Might.
As Tanner has posted, programs such as the Magical Jelly Bean are also useful in this situation as it will grab more than just the Windows product key (programs such as Adobe products, Microsoft Office, etc.).
When you reinstall windows on a Non-OEM machine you will be asked for a key. That key is written on the CoA sticker (the one you said is too blurry to read).
What you want is to discover restore the correct key based on that product key. This is the tool I usually use for that. And here is a page with links to 14 more similar products.
No, with Product ID you can't reinstall Windows 7. If you lost the serial number you must buy a new copy, because Windows 7 do not store any serial number like older Windows versions you can't recover it with software.
