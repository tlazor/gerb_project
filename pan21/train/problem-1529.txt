For photoshop the minium requirements are 1024x768 display (1280x800 recommended) with qualified hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics card, 16-bit color, and 256MB of VRAM. The key item is hardware acceleration your not going to get that on the built in chip, is the sole reason why it won't work or work very poorly on an integrated graphical system. For the nvidia board its a toss up but your mileage may vary on how much performance your going to get without a physical card in the pci-e slot.
Not true in my opinion. Some enthusiast-motherboards (keywords: dynamic overclocking, OC Genie) come with integrated automatic overclocking, which means they'll get some extra juice (< 5%) out of your components. The specs on the intel board you mentioned do not advertise an automatic overclocking feature.
(if your in the US), and buy a cheap PCI-E video card in the range of 30-50 USD. This will almost insure that you can play back your videos. 
Apart from that I don't think Photoshop or even Movies will benefit much from a built-in GPU of any kind.
To answer your original question: "Is it enough for photoshop and HD movies ?" It's a no for photoshop, and a maybe for HD video. The intergrated video on the board shares memory with the cpu giving a performance hit. Performance is the factor your looking for and that also depends greatly on the HD file or media your using - if your trying to watch the latest and greatest blu-ray rip, your probably not going be able to watch that, not without an upgrade for your video card; however if your just watching something that was encoded in say divx or xvid you should have no issues. With the nvidia board you are more likely to be able to play HD video again depending on the encoding and size of the file. What I recommend to you instead is to buy the cheaper board, go to www.newegg.com
