This depends on whether you're looking for high availability or load balancing, too...DRBD and Pacemaker is meant for availability, but recent versions added a "primary-primary" configuration so it can work with load balancing as well, but it depends on how you architect the application. You can also find examples on the web for using Xen to create a virtual machine that is balanced on two systems with DRBD and that may give you what you're looking for.
You might want to look at a solution integrating DRBD and Pacemaker; DRBD acts kind of like a network-level RAID-1 configuration. From there you can have two servers with identical data partitions, then when/if one system fails pacemaker will fence off the old system and the other server picks up the slack.
Others have taken care of most of the solutions, but there is one more that covers the cloning part.  For a one-time copy, I would suggest using Clonezilla.  (http://clonezilla.org/)  It's like Norton Ghost, but free.  As long as the destination drive is at least as big as the source (I don't believe you can clone to a smaller disk), it can do all the cloning for you.  You would have to login after booting to change the IP/hostname and some other things if you intend to have both systems running in parallel.
dd will copy the hard-drive directly to create an identical version. However, you would need to setup a regular to job to do that, and have ther drives cross-mounted, or physically move them.
