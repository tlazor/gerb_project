I'd hazard a guess (hard to be sure without more investigation) that someone is spoofing your IP as a source and you're getting the return traffic.
Btw, I'm getting this packets from multiple sources, which leads me to think this might be some kind of (D)DoS. But I'm not sure which role I'm playing on this.
You can't stop the packets coming to you (your provider needs to do that), all you can do is drop them to minimize the impact on your host.
I keep getting ICMP type 3 code 13 packets on tcpdump. when I run tcpdump icmp, I get messages like:
Be careful, ICMP is critical for the working of the 'net, it is used to tell you that some connection worn't work among a long list of other error messages. To swamp any reasonable machine via ICMP would take quite some ingenuity from a miscreant, don't worry too much about this.
Remember that tcpdump examines the "wire" (ie, BEFORE iptables) so you'll still see the traffic in tcpdump even if iptables is dropping the traffic.
Remember that the iptables rules are processed in the order given, so if the chain returns before it reaches your rule it won't have an effect.
