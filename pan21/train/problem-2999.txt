Having demoed literally dozens of apps in this category, I'm surprised this one isn't more well known.
IF you don't want to get anything new, you can make a macro in Photoshop to crop the image down to the size you want it, then batch run it on all the screenshots you've taken.
Now i've tried it: XScope contains a tool named "frames". You can place a frame on your screen, resize it to your desired size and aspect ratio and take as many screenshots as you like without losing the frame or its position/aspect ratio.
There are two options to make this whole thing a lot easier for you - they are tools that specifically take screenshots of webpages with you having to go through the rigmarole of visiting the site, taking a screenshot and then editing it in Photoshop or the like.
There's a little app called SimpleCap (free) that is perfect for this. I came across it a few months ago at the tail end of a very long search for screenshot tools, and have been using it on a daily basis ever since.
webkit2png is a command-line tool, and probably the most automatable if you are comfortable with the command-line.
It gives you the option to take shots of the full screen, windows, custom selections, applications, menus and even dashboard widgets. It lets you choose the image format, enable image treatments, set up preset selection sizes, export to other apps, set a countdown/timer, and it even has some light file management functionality. It can do more than many of the premium apps, and is one of those tools that you'll continue to find new uses for down the road.
It'll save those screenshots to your desktop appending a number, so it's not exactly what you're looking for, but i think it's close.
