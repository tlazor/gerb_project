2) If you are in an application, then tap near the bottom of the screen and pull down and back up.  Sometimes just pulling down is enough.  Depends on the application.  In Wordpad a simple swipe down was enough.  In Chrome I have to swipe down and back up.  If Chrome is fullscreen (F11) then nothing works.
1) Assuming that the taskbar is at the bottom, find an open area of the desktop and swipe down.  You "might" need to tap the desktop first just to give it focus but not always.
Touch a free space on the desktop and drag quickly past the end of the screen where your taskbar is located (hidden) then quickly drag back to the desktop and the taskbar will appear.
Not only does this combination open the Task Manager, but it also brings it to the foreground when hidden, and at the same tab that you last used it.
You can press Alt+Shift+Esc  to switch between windows (which also brings the taskbar to the foreground).
With Windows+Comma (Not the comma on the numpad), you can peek to the desktop (which will also show you the taskbar) - but only temporary.
If you're using an external monitor, this combination only displays the taskbar on the windows' monitor, whereas Windows+T shows all taskbars, and doesn't switch the windows.
