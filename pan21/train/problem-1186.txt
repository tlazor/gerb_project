i got some routing problems, i recently installed a wireless router on my garage so i can have ethernet on my garage office, and id like to remotely access my computer, the setup is as follows:
Your router isn't allowing you to port forward to an IP address that isn't on it's local network - that's typical for a home router. You've hooked the routers up wrong. This is not how you should extend your network. You created two independent networks when you should be extending the existing network out to your garage. Also, why are you using a router out in the garage? Why aren't you just using a network switch? Or do you need wireless too? There are so many problems with the way you have it setup.
Win 10 pc has been configured to allow remote connections (configured firewall ports and configured a static ip), i also configured the secondary router to port forward the remote port to that pc, my question is how do i forward the port from the main router? It doesnt allow me to enter an ip above the 192.168.xx range
Set your network up exactly how I answered here: https://superuser.com/questions/1232080/will-connecting-extra-routers-to-my-main-router-increase-the-load-on-all/1232106#1232106
