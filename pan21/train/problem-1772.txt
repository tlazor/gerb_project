It sounds like you've already done captures.  If you've verified your address resolution requests are being sent, but you're not receiving replies, that sounds like either their router isn't responding or a layer 2 device in the path is dropping them - for whatever reason, be it bug or configuration.  If they're willing to provide configurations, you might also ask about the actual physical interface configuration here (ge1/48) and any switch ports the VLAN is trunked through on their network.
If we add an entry to the neighbor table manually, everything is working fine, but obviously that's a bit of a hacky solution.
With one of our network providers our Linux based router (Vyatta/Debian) can't talk to their Cisco router over IPv6.   Their router seems to not reply to the ICMP6 neighbor solicitation requests that ours send.  This is working fine between our two routers on this VLAN and between our routers and every other provider and peer we have; IPv4 on the same interface to the same provider is working fine, too.
Which all looks pretty default/standard to me.  When I got them to ping our side of the interface, a ping in both directions immediately started working.  (Our router replied to the ND request and I guess our router figured out their mac address from the ICMP6 ECHO request).
If you're sure it's not your end (Are you direct to the provider from your router?  Attempted other hardware?), then I'd say push for debugs at the Cisco and/or span/port mirroring on their ingress switch port to capture and confirm if they're seeing your requests inbound.  If they confirm they are and they aren't replying, they're somewhat obligated to determine why from there.
