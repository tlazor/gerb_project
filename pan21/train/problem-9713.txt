You will need to trigger the install action for the install_options to take effect. A possible workaround is to first ensure => absent, and then once the package is removed you can ensure => present or ensure => 1.2-8+deb8u1 and the subsequent install will honor install_options.
I'm using APT pinning quite extensively since a while, and I believe this is (one of) the cleanest solutions out there, especially if combined with unattended upgrades and / or a regular apt-get dist-upgrade.
I believe ensure => installed will only make sure it is installed, but it won't upgrade if there is a newer version.  Use latest to do that.  It will also only upgrade if there is a newer version.  If that is a preferred version you want that is older than the version that is currently installed, you will have to find a way to work around that.  Perhaps an exec that will check if current installed version is different than the version in that other repo, then uninstall if it is, and let the package resource install the correct version after.
