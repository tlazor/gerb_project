However, the better thing is to not use email to get pictures from your phone to your computer: either change the settings of your phone's mail client to attach the images rather than inlining/embedding them in the messages, or if possible use one of the myriad of file transfer/cloud drive solutions that offer image backup.
You could turn this into a macro if you have a lot of images to save. Outlook, like other Office products, supports the full Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro language and so you can program really cool things.
In-lined images cannot be saved via right-click, as you've found out. This is the normal behavior for Outlook.
Running current Outlook as supplied via O365.  I sent myself a bunch of images from my phone so I could download them on the computer.  I can see them fine, but they are in-line.  If I go to save attachments there are none to save.  If I right click to copy them to try to paste and save elsewhere, I'm not allowed to copy.  If I save the entire message to disk it still saves it as one big thing (does not split out the images into a folder like older Outlook versions used to).  How can I extract these images from this e-mail and save them as individuals?
