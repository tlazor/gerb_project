I can't tell you how many times (recently) I had to pull our security policy to explain things, like why your dog's name isn't a good password for a production system.
Don't try to be irreplaceable. Spread your knowledge and documentation. You don't want to be constantly called on the phone on holidays just because no one else knows about the systems you manage.
Because, if you're polite, but dont know the answer / how to fix it, they'll at least feel better that you didnt upset them further.  
But at the end of the day, they'll remember you, and will call on you because you're polite and friendly.
Don't just learn specific apps and systems and OS'es. Learn the standards and protocols and conventions behind them, so you don't get completely lost if you need to move from one OS to the next for example. Keep up with the knowledge and your skills.
Also, take care of yourself, take breaks and do some exercise when not working. Get a good chair and table. Don't break your back and neck on your first year of work.
One thing that took me a while to learn was how to communicate and disconnect emotionally. Deal with the situation, and treat the person you're helping with respect and kindness. You wont get thanks (often), and you wont see any 'gratitude'.
Stick to your decisions until someone shows you a policy that counteracts it, or until you're over-ridden by management.
One thing is dealing with people. They're impatient. When they call you they're already flustered. IF they're upset, its not at you - its because the technology that's meant to solve their problems seems to them to be causing more (and quite often, it does). They'll most likely vent to you: But dont take that as a personal criticism.
