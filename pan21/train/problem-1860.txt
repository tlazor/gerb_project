Of course, things like Ghost still exist, but WDS really seems to have a stranglehold on PXE deployment of Windows nowadays.
You would use an answer file with this. You can use the Windows Automated Installation Kit, which is freely available. From that kit, install the Windows System Image Manager and it will give you a GUI and some samples for this. You can do everything you want there, including running commands on first bootup to customize whatever you want.
I've used WinPE from the WAIK toolkit to get a boot image that I've then distribured via tftpd + pxelinux to PXE clients. From that WinPE image, you can call an unattended file made with WSIM and you just need the install image and all other resources to sit on an SMB share, which can be a SAMBA server for all it matters.
WDS is the canonical answer for this. It's free with Windows Server and can be paired with the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit for complex installs, or can be used by itself for more straightforward deployments.
The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit is also a way to handle all of these things. Either one is a good choice with MDT being much more in-depth but more powerful.
Unfortunately for you, Windows imaging can be as complicated as you want to make it, and you have a couple of more advanced requirements. They're all completely do-able, but you need to invest some real time into learning how everything works.
It sounds like you were headed in the right direction for a Linux-based deployment, but it's really a tricky thing. You need to know the ins-and-outs of the boot process, which I why I always recommend WDS when I can. It comes with a nice pretty bow on it and takes that headache away.
