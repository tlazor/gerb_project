Use more specific exceptions than Exception. An except-Block without any error handling is superfluous.
Overall, your code looks pretty good.  It is well laid out,  your functions are all documented, you sanitize your input, and I haven't noticed any violations of PEP 8.
Use standard libraries instead of self written ones. logging.info instead syslog_info, subprocess.call instead of exec_cmd, etc.
You raise many exceptions, but you are no more specific than Exception.  You should use a more specific class and give a message of some kind.  You give the message to the error log, but it should also be in the traceback.
Your create_parser function says that it returns the parsed arguments, but it actually returns the parser.  Fix your documentation.  Your description of the program seems more like a comment about the current line.  Again, fix your documentation. I like that you split up your lines.  That makes it much more readable.  A small tidbit of information: if you say parser.add_argument("--options"), the location will by default be options.   One last point, I would add some short options.  That is, add '-o' when you add the options argument, etc.  That way, the user can use some shortcuts.  When you call parser.parse_args(), you pass it argv[1:].  You don't need to do that.  Just don't pass it anything, and it will figure it out.
