Buy a good quality set of small screw drivers, small wire cutter, small  pliers. I also like to use a small screw driver type socket set. One tool I would not be without is a hemostat (a small locking set of clamps used by surgeons). They are great for holding small items. As my eyes are not as young as they used to be I also like a magnifier to read the small print on many chips and sockets. A battery powered screw driver saves your wrist. I have not had to solder in a while. I never liked the simple soldering pencils. If you are going to do a lot of soldering invest in a good unit with a temp control. You will really need it with the new lead free solders. For field use I once had a butane fueled soldering iron that worked well, but this was before 9-11 and I don't know if I would want to try to carry one today.
My personal opinion though: I've accumulated most of my tools over time from a small starter kit, with basic tools such as those you can find at any electronic store that contain a screwdriver interchangeable bit set, strap, needle noses, dykes, tweezers, etc. Everything else I bought over time and added it to my arsenal. You normally won't find a complete set from what I've seen.
