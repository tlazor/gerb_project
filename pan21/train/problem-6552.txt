If your enclosure show up as "H", then the link falls down to USB 2.0 mode, period, and your bulk transfer rates won't exceed 35-40 MBytes/s.
This is one way how to determine if your new USB enclosure operates in SS mode, to see the sign "S" in USBDeviceTree viewer. Just like you did confirm this with USB 3.0 pen drive.
The likely reason is that either your USB host controller (some no-name "Etron xHCI") has signal integrity or training protocol (or power delivery) deficiency, or the USB-SATA bridge inside your HDD enclosure has some deficiency. One common deficiency is current starvation during spin-up of older SATA drives, since USB 3.0 interface is less tolerant to voltage dips than the companion USB 2.0 link.
If you want to verify if your HDD enclosure is capable of running at SS rates, you either need to find another PC Host with higher port power capability, or try to use a small SSD drive instead of your old mechanical SATA drive, as a test. SSD SATA usually have no problems with power supply and don't have spin-up excessive consumption.
