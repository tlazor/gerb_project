I had to have two because when I didn't have the sql one specifically mysql wasn't starting but apache was. This may be because I have SSL enabled or something weird like that. Anyhow, having both of them solved the problem for me, and I did use the Console.app to check for error messages when starting apache - that was helpful, too.
I can't get XAMPP to start when OS X boots. I've been researching this for some time but with no luck. XAMPP needs to be started as root, and I don't want to store the password for root in a script somewhere and use the "login items" of the accounts pref pane to start xampp. Yes, that will work, but it's not the right way.
I suspect you're running afoul of launchd's expectations of the programs it launches.  It's not primarily intended for things that need to just be run, it's for things that need to be run and kept alive -- so when xampp startapache finishes, launchd says to itself "OMG it exited, I'd better clean up the remains and start a new instance"...  I haven't tested this with xampp, but I suspect that adding keys to the .plist to tell it not to restart (KeepAlive=false) and not clean up spawned subprocesses (AbandonProcessGroup=true) will do the trick:
I'm trying to launch it using launchd / users damons / LaunchDaemons. That includes creating a plist file in the "/Library/LaunchDaemons" directory.
That was outlined here as well as on several other similar help pages. I've tried editing the files manually, and I've also tried using Lingon. But it just dosen't work! I've even tried doing a similar entry for a script file located in the same directory, which would echo the time to a log file. The log file is just blank - like the script is not being run.
