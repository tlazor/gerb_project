If the question was about a printer that uses cartridges that contain the printhead, it is conceivable that a third-party cartridge might be manufactured incorrectly, like the nozzles not being in precisely the right place.  The question is about a refilled cartridge, so even that possibility is pretty remote.
However, the question is about a printer for which the cartridges are just ink tanks that feed a printhead that is not disturbed (neither the nozzles nor the contacts are affected by cartridge replacement).  In this case, cartridge replacement has no effect on alignment, either causing problems or fixing them.
The problem with some refilled cartridges is the connectors where the ink comes out is only rated for a certain amount of use, and when the cartridge is depleted, those connectors can either become partially or totally blocked.  A certified ink "refiller" should clean the connectors but even that won't fix it (being they're on eBay they might just be injecting new ink into an old cartridge and calling it a day).
Is it possible that if I replace the colour cartridge with a nice new one, my problems will disappear?
This is a very old question, but the existing answers are surprising and a correct answer should be available for future readers.
Thing is, I can't quite get my head around the cartridge itself and not the printhead being responsible.
I'd replace for a new cartridge, and try to clean the printer connectors as best as you can before reinserting a new cartridge.
Did you remove and reinsert the cartridge to be sure it is seated properly? I would ask for a refund and but a new one if it will not align properly
(I'm also assuming your printer has ink cartridges and printheads...if it doesn't, then the printhead is on the cartridge and that tends to get "gunked" up as well.)
