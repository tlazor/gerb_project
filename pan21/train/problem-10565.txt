So ideally I need a way to dynamically set the line height / line spacing or something. Or another creative idea to display pretty tetris boards.
I am using black squares \xe2\x97\xbc◼ and white squares \xe2\x97\xbb◻ to display tetris boards in my shell. Unfortunately there is quite a visible line spacing between rows and that just doesn't look good.
Using a space character with a background color as suggested by Miles is the best way to fill exactly one character cell.
In addition, if you use the VT100 "graphic" characters, Terminal will render them by drawing the lines "manually" to ensure they connect, instead of using character glyphs. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain single-character-cell boxes. You'd have to draw boxes using four characters to draw the corners. e.g.:
Terminal has controls for horizontal and vertical spacing in the Font panel, which you can open by clicking the Change button:
I am on a Mac (zsh) and there is a line spacing setting. When I reduce it to the minimum (0.5) it looks pretty good. But unfortunately the rest of the terminal looks bad then ;)
