I have a Netapp with some NFS exports for VMware storage.  I want to mount the snapshots on a Windows 2012 R2 server in order to copy all of the virtual machine files to tape.  I can mount the share just fine, but I can only copy some of the files.  They have various permissions; some are 600, some are 644, and some are 755.  It's the 600 ones that I cannot copy. I get an error in Windows when trying to copy those. The other files copy just fine.  I've tried various options in the mount command, but to no avail.  I'm pretty sure it's not an option to change the file permissions.  Is there any other solution?
Incidentally, that confirms my suspicion that there's something funky about the way Windows mounts NFS shares.
I found a work-around.  Since the LTFS software presents the tape drive as a logical disk drive in Windows, I shared that drive.  Then I created a Linux VM, and mounted the share on it.  In the Linux VM I can mount the NFS share and copy everything without any errors.  So at that point it's just a matter of using rsync to copy from one mount point to the other.
