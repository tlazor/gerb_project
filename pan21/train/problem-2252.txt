You might also consider disabling 8dot3 file name creation if you don't need it, as well. Do this, especially, if you have a large number of files in a single directory. (Although turning this off won't get rid of the 8dot3 names that are already there...)
If the volume is in use 24 x 7 then you're probably stuck "disturbing" the users. If not, schedule the "defrag -a -v C:" command to run in off-hours w/ its output redirected to a file. That will get you the command output w/o requiring you to be awake to run it at 4AM on a Sunday.  >smile<
Running the disk defragmenter in analysis mode is the only way I'm aware of to see how many MFT fragments you have. 
Do you have enough space on the SAN to do a restore of the entire contents of the volume to a fresh LUN configured similarly (w/ respect to its SAN properties-- RAID level, etc) as the production LUN?  It would be interesting to see how a freshly laid-down NTFS filesystem w/ 8dot3 name creation disabled from the outset, and perhaps a differently-sized MFT zone, behaves compared to the production LUN. (It wouldn't be too difficult, either, to orchestrate a migration via copying changed files from the production LUN to this staging LUN if the staging LUN proves to function better.)
Comparing the output of "fsutil fsinfo statistics" on the volume in question before / after this slow "initial crawl" might tell you something about what's going on, albeit I think it's just going to show you that a hideous amount of metadata reads are occurring.
I can't give you statitics re: "NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate", but I'd certainly set it unless you have need for the last access time to be saved. (I'd use the "fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 1" command, rather than setting it in the registry. You do have to reboot, as well, for the change to take effect.)
