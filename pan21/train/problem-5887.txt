I've tested this theory by editing the hosts file and pointing company.com to Google.com and adding an IPv6 entry to ::1.  The result is that Autodiscover ran quickly, with no errors.
When a user runs Autodiscover we notice the first URL queried is https://company.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml.  Since company.com is the name of their AD forest, they are querying a random AD Domain Controller for this HTTPS query.
We host email for 200 different companies, each of them has an AD forest and we have no forest trust, or VPN to those other AD Domains.  The forest name of each of the 200 companies matches the name of the email address.  We ask each company to use a SRV record to redirect autodiscover queries to https://autodiscover.hoster.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml
Due to how their AD is configured with firewalls, slow connections, etc, the random domain controller that comes up during this first HTTPS query causes Autodiscover to hang, and I think it is preventing Outlook 2007 from updating properly.
