This is the cipher used in this puzzling post, if you would like to crack it before looking at the programs use to make it.
It is a constant, so by PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code its name should be in uppercase letters:
Moreover, they are the same in your both modules (encoder.py and decoder.py) - why don't use the 3rd module for all common functions and import from it?
Several weeks ago, I created a custom cipher for a friend of mine to crack, and I also posted it on Puzzling. Here are the programs I used to create it - I threw them together one morning, and I didn't comment them. I decided to leave them as is - they are self-explanatory to some degree, and I would also like to have my rush-job instinct in variable naming and what not critiqued. I know it's not good per say, but since it was a personal project I didn't care. How the cipher works is explained the in answer to the puzzling question, if my code doesn't show you well enough.
I have an encoder and a decoder. They currently assume that plaintext.txt, code.txt, and decoded.txt are in the current directory. The decoder assumes that the code is formatted as the encoder would format it.
have very similar structure - by the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) why not to substitute them with one common function, e. g. with
which has the advantage of automatically closing the open file, even if an exception is raised on the way.
