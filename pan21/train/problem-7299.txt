Let us suppose the problem is your WiFi card / connection. MacOS is a UNIX-based system, so you should have some logs present in /var/log/ or dmesg, which you can access using a Terminal. See if there are any helpful errors present there.
You should download an Ubuntu boot disk for your laptop model and try to use the WiFi network. If the problem persists in the same way, it is a software problem. Let us suppose it is.
Now, you have identified it is a software problem. You should now isolate on which level the problem is present.
If the problem persists, you know it is either due to wireless interference or your access point. Let us suppose the problem does not persist; the problem is due to either your macbook hardware or the operating system.
Your main question is the following: Where could I start tracing this error? What else can I do to try and track it down or fix it?
You should first try to test your connection with another laptop. You could for example try with your smartphone or the smartphone of a friend.
