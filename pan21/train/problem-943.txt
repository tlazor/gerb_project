Some products like Oracle Internet Directory + Oracle SSO (and IBM TIM/TAM) allow hooking to 3rd party systems. This means the product is configured to sync with AD, and stores credentials to every other product you ever imagine. You get a new login link which seeds the credentials to the system you want (in this case - Google Apps), and that's it.
Looks like there is Google Apps Password Sync (GAPS) for synchronising passwords to be used in combination with active directory sync. But I've not used it yet.
I've looked over google's "tfm"s in the past, but I guess I just don't quite get it. Has anyone does this? If so, would you be willing to share how? Can it be done without a huge amount of complexity and expense?
I'd like to get some method of SSO going between AD and Google Apps such that AD is the only place my folks have to manage (and periodically CHANGE!) passwords.
Keep in mind it is quite complicated to get such a configuration up and running, and might also cost you some money, so it doesn't suit every orgranization.
We're a small shop running Google Apps (Enterprise) for our email needs. Love it. Internally, we're using Windows AD (2003). No complaints there either.
