Without a doubt, your host should not be running AD DS. Definitely create a virtual Domain Controller.
This is really up to you - the latter is a perfectly acceptable solution if you configure your Sites properly so that AD knows that there is a WAN inbetween. But, you don't really say what relationship the servers in the DC have to you. If you're not going to get any real benefit from it then you may just be creating work for yourself.
Personally, I wouldn't. With a single host, I don't think you're going to get any advantages and because of your lack of AD redundancy, you are creating a dangerous single point of failure as you point out. This answer changes when you being scaling out and have a decent AD infrastructure. Also, ensure your Host is configured with static IP and DNS.
Yes, but what makes a lot more sense is to have a secondary domain controller on a different host, or have a separate physical domain controller. I'm guessing you don't have the luxury so a second VM is better than nothing, but be aware that a host or storage failure could leave you in a bad place. Ensure your backup strategy is spot on.
I'm not going to sit and say "YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS", but you need to be aware of how fragile everything will be sitting on one host.
