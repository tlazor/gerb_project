If you are unhappy with the video RAM why not buy a graphics card? It's way easier than swapping the motherboard.
I've got a couple of motherboards with Athlon XP 2400s (2.0GHz iirc) fitted that are gathering dust in a box of bits somewhere.  They pretty much became too expensive to upgrade any individual part about 7 years ago.
And since your old computer is from 2002 I think it could be a problem for you to find a motherboard that would like your old RAM sticks and have the correct CPU socket. You'll probably have to buy a new motherboard, new RAM and a new CPU.
You'll be better off buying some sort of motherboard bundle from whoever your local supplier is, even the cheapest is likely to have a better processor and onboard graphics than a 2002 motherboard, with at least some current prospects for being upgradable without being extortionately expensive.
I suppose your processor has Socket A pins. I have bad news - these died more than 5 years ago. You'll not find a motherbord with such socket today.
To be honest the only place you'll be able to buy a motherboard that will work with that processor is going to be on eBay, and even then I would question how reliable to board would be given its age.
