I was getting the same error during installation however CF does not do the actual migration process until you load the CFIDE.  Bringing the CFIDE online after doing the upgrade process kicked off the actual upgrade process and migrated my settings.  Some settings however do not migrate from CF8 to CF10 correctly and will need to be manually migrated.  Scheduled tasks are one of those items.
I would perform a registry value search on 'C:\ColdFusion' using the regedit tool to see if there are some mapping oddities between CF versions and install file paths.  I would also look in the IIS management console settings to check the handler module mapping between the .cfm extension and the .dll (handler).  The fact that the installer is looking for a previous version 6 or 7 of CF installed to a directory with a path that suggests a version 8 install lives there just seems like a mapping issue to me.  Maybe there was a dirty uninstall of a version 6 or 7 that did not remove all of the registry settings before some were updated to reflect version 8 settings?
Because of this I'm doing the setup in a coexist mode to start with and migrating the settings over to the CF10 server.  After that they have a nice GUI tool now to convert websites to use CF10.  However the flaw in the tool I've found is on IIS7/7.5 it does not remove the old CF8 references so you have to manually remove those.
