This should work fine with Ubuntu. All your hardware is detected on boot, and the appropriate "drivers" (kernel modules) loaded. This is, of course, assuming you aren't doing anything silly like putting a 32bit CPU into a box running 64-bit Ubuntu or anything.
Not a snap but what happened was: I changed to quad-core AMD (motherboard had failed) not wanting complete reload over my recent Ubuntu kernel. Linux started but only reached a splash screen no login. On the GRUB menu I tried recovery/safe and also limited graphic mode choices also the GRUB terminal still did not get to solution. At the splash screen where I would login, Although I could not see anything, I then typed my user name then Enter, then password then Enter and the login started. Next was the plain desktop background but no icons or buttons :(. Keystrokes Cnt-Alt-T did not pop up terminal. **Then I tried gnu shortcut Alt-F2 and 2-second pause a beautiful command prompt popped up :). It said welcome and upgrade recommended please type do-upgrade- something I did it after a 3 hour upgrade all works fine. Ignore errors. Best luck with yours.
