So I've just setup a brand new box and thought it would be a good time to make an image with Clonezilla.
But it appears that it will take more or less about 4 hours to create the image with  Clonezilla.  Should it really take that long to create an image of 4GB of data?
Another thing to check since you mentioned partimage is what filesystem you have on the USB drive. Even if it's a 16 gig drive, if the filesystem can't handle a single 4 gig file, the clone may fail and some open source programs do not handle failure gracefully...you might have been sitting for four hours with a program that's not even running anymore or is "stuck".
The harddrive is 250GB with ~4GB used on the partition that I have chosen to backup, so I plugged in a 16GB USB stick to store the image on, which should be sufficient (?).
There really isn't a canonical answer to this since it would depend on disk subsystem speeds, fragmentation, etc. so it doesn't quite fit this format well.
Backups are generally done at the file level. Clones/images are drive level. You probably need to use either cloning with compression or a true backup program that will copy files and compress the files, not the resulting filesystem image file.
That said, if it's a "clone" of the drive, it will try to copy the entire drive, sector by sector. The way to get the end image smaller is to compress it.
