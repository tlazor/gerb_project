One other thing: I do guitar audio and I actually had better results with latency (not on a laptop) when I set the Realtek audio to 96k. So you might look at trying to adjust the sample rate for audio (control panel). Try 44K, 48k, and 96 and see if there's any change.
FYI doesn't matter if you update your drivers, and power setting, CPU the problem is going to stick around until Realtex fixes their issues. Follow the steps I've you and cracking sound will be gone
Right Click on file RTUPD64 Something like that click on properties after that your going to look at the tabs look for SECURITY, Click on SYSTEM click sure you (DENY)  when your done apply the setting and ok. Your safe to Reboot.
Follow these last steps if not Realtex is going to keep auto install your drivers and the cracking sound will come back regardless what you do
I've got the exact same problem and been googling around for solutions. It's likely to be driver-related. Uninstalling Realtek Driver and let Windows uses its native driver fixes the issue for me. Please try it, if it works for you too then it's the Realtek Driver that causes the problem.
You can try disabling the "ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery" in device manager and see if that helps. This will also disable the battery status icon. ( see for instance: http://www.virtualdj.com/forums/155414/PC_Version_Technical_Support/Disabling_acpi_sys_under_hardware_management.html ) Don't disable or delete any ACPI stuff without reading up on it first, though as disabling the wrong things can potential render you laptop unbootable (require a reinstall)
Your going to have to disable it and after that remove the realtex do not REBOOT the computer/laptop yet.
