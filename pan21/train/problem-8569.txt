If it's tables or databases, let's discuss how to do that.  Please provide some hints of what your tables are.  Pending that, I will provide some generic suggestions.
Caveat:  Much of what I have said will be invalid with version 8.0 and it's integrated Data Dictionary.  Lots of databases or tables or partitions is not much of a problem.
Then, to get away from one-table-per, you will need a lot of disk space and downtime to copy the million tables into a handful, adding the id as you go.
If it's partitions, let's discuss that.  More than about 50 partitions in a single table leads to inefficiencies.  Tables with fewer than a million rows should not (in general) be partitioned.  Please provide SHOW CREATE TABLE, since there are many possible issues.  I give some answers here .
Instead of having one-table-per-entity, have one table.  In it have an id that indicates which entity is involved.  ("Entity" is "user", "company", or whatever you are creating new tables based on.)
Patterns of database or table names may be obvious.  Names ending like #p#p200805 are partition names.
