I would absolutely suggest installing the update. IE is rather tightly coupled with the operating system and parts and pieces can be used by a surprising variety of applications. Even if you're not browsing with it on a daily basis, it's still on your system and is still a security hole.
More importantly, what's the risk/return on not doing it? The value of not doing it is not having to restart the machine. Meanwhile, if IE accidentally gets launched or is used without you being aware, it puts you at risk.
Just because you don't plan to use one of the pockets in your pants, if they have a hole, you should still patch them!
I am aware that I cannot uninstall IE and it remains on my system. Are there any security issues if I do not install the available updates or can I discard all the updates for IE?
I have disabled Internet Explorer in the "Windows Features" dialog. Nonetheless Windows Update alerts me that there are security updates for IE.
Additionally, as you can't uninstall Internet Explorer, it can run and make your system vulnerable. You don't know when it will run. For example, if you're viewing a Help file (.chm), Internet Explorer is rendering the page for you. Some browsers and other applications use Internet Explorer under the covers to render rich content. Again, a vulnerability here puts your whole system at risk.
Internet Explorer is very tightly woven into the fabric of Windows. For example, Internet Explorer's proxy settings, the hosts file and Windows Firewall are examples of parts of Windows that are intertwined with Internet Explorer. A vulnerability here puts your whole system at risk.
