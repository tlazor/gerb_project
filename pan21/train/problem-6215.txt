Generalize prepares windows to be loaded to another PC. If you specify this option, all unique system information is removed from the Windows installation. The systemâ€™s SID is reset, any System Restore points are cleared, and event logs are deleted. The next time the computer starts, the specialize configuration pass runs. A new SID is created, and all drivers are cleared out.
I found this very interesting. It doesn't mean it won't work. (Indeed some backup/imaging tools explicitly boats this capability.) But it does mean, as far as I understand, that MS doesn't care about this scenario.
I have a PC running windows 7.  I have created a system image from this PC and I'd like to 'install' that system image on a different machine.  But I keep getting an error message after running the recovery console that the computer could not boot up do to a general error.  Is it possible to create a system image on one PC and load the image on a totally different PC?
Use ImageX (Microsoft's free imaging tool.) to capture the image, load that image into a VM (like virtualbox) and then sysprep it using the /generalize flag. 
As an alternative you could create the image with Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery and restore it to the different hardware.  Use this often and itw works very well.  Just did a laptop  restore from a current Dell E6500  to a Dell D810 wee had spare.  Worked perfectly even though harware was very different.  A few drivers needed installing but only minor issues.  There is a wizard that will check for drivers which can then be added to teh recovery disk.
