So why doing this would leave the machine unbootable is a good question.  It could be that update-initramfs did something bad to the boot partition mounted on /boot, since it is likely identical to the stock Debian version which is intended for something different.
Since the Pi kernel is only used on the pi, there is no need to provide a variety of loadable modular drivers for the kernel to pick from.  The necessary set is just built into the kernel.
However, you can use an initramfs, but you'll need to compile your own kernel too, since I believe the stock one does not have support for such (but I could be wrong about that, I did not check).
The stock Pi kernel doesn't use an initramfs, because the predominant use for such is to load drivers appropriate to the hardware in cases where the kernel is being used on a wide variety of machines (such as a normal linux distro is).  It's done that way because the drivers may be mutually exclusive, and packing them all into the kernel itself would produce an excessively large binary.
