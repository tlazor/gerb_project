The PWM comes from Pulse Width Modulation and is a way of controlling fan speed. I wouldn't be concerned with zeros there. Check how many pins the fan connectors have and how many wires the fans have. PWM connectors should have 4 pins. If fan cables have less, then the aren't using PWM.
I myself would be more concerned with voltage readings. the 3.41V at +5 line is dangerously low and can be a symptom of bad PSU. Check what voltages in your BIOS say, because sometimes diagnostic software can report bad readings. 
Usually on Asus motherboards CPU fan connector is close to CPU socket, so CPU fan is connected to it. Other connectors have names too, but their names do not have to match their functions. You can plug any fan into any connector and it will show up under that connector in diagnostic programs. Unless you actually plugged the power supply fan into the power supply fan socket on motherboard, PSU fan reading has no relation to what PSU fan is doing. 
Your first step should be to actually check how many fans you have and to what is each fan connected. The names for fans are just that: names.
Also that 128C temperature looks really bad, but on the other hand it could be some phantom reading.
