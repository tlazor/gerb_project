For the case, I see it would be beneficial to consider 3-2-1 rule with RTO and RPO in order to get planned Backup and DR sites. 
Hard disk isn't designed to store data for some reasonably long period of time. For vaulting you need disk -> tape and use something like Iron Mountain and similar services. Companies who need to mess with regulatory requirements do this for years. 
Another lower budget option that is accessible would be to put a NAS in a different physical building with a network connection that is either fiber or point to point wireless.
I have a few HDDs which contain backup data. I want to store them in a secure place. I know some good practices like storing them in a different building so if there is, let's say, a fire, you can still restore the data. But I am more concerned in the degradation of the HDDs, for example by humidity. Should I store them in a plastic bag? Is there any special way to store the HDDs so they can not be damaged by the enviroment?
For a backup and DR boxes, I am using 2x Synology, so I can suggest you to take a look what they got. Veeam Backup software is used to backup/move data to backup NAS and then to DR one (that is in other building).
I found the hardware solution from aclouda that seems to be more beneficial for your caser. I see it allows to use cloud storage as local SCSI drive thus it allows to run backup jobs to cloud as it would be local drive. 
I agree that a NAS is always the best answer for external storage.  If you truly want "Off site", I would recommend a safe deposit box.  If you are looking to store this long term and only touch it in the event of a catastrophic event, you could use a zip lock bag or even vacuum seal it before storing it in the safe deposit box.  If you use any sort of on site media rated (class 125) safe, you will need to include some sort of desiccant in that safe to keep the humidity to a minimum.
