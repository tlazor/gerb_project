If the HTTP response code for that entry is 407 (proxy authorization required) then this is probably the case, and should be followed pretty quickly by another authenticated request (assuming the client has authorization) for the same resource from the same IP.  If it's not followed by another request for the same resource from the same IP then it's possible that the client just bailed on the session prompted for proxy authentication.
They might have just used their own proxy for that. Your servers would only see the user connecting to his own remote system. (And as someone who believes logging browsed pages is evil, I do know quite a few ways to do that.)
Depending on your proxy, that Anonymous entry in the log file could just be the initial request from the browser before it knows it has to provide proxy authorization.
Also be aware the user could be utilizing something like Remote Desktop or VNC and simply connecting to a different system.  A web proxy doesn't come into play in those situations, and the user would be able to access whatever they felt like.  While it might violate use policy, it isn't outright malicious either.
First off - Yes, of course it's possible. Why not use something like Wireshark to see what is moving on the network? As long as you are monitoring from an appropriate point on the network you'll see what traffic is bypassing the proxy and where its going.
