You know what the funny thing is? They are more pissed off about four hours intermittent downtime -- than 2 month overdue project?! Go figure
My answer to this problem was simple. I picked up the phone, called the rest of Management, and said;
If it is for a limited number of users, then this can accomplished with Custom Recipients (a.k.a. aliases). For "bulk" redirection to another server, then this can be accomplished through the SMTP connector - http://www.msexchange.org/tutorials/Configuring-SMTP-Connector.html. Ultimately, "swinging" the MX is the "better" route, if there is no other reasons for the emails to flow though the subject server.

This sounds like something that Exchange journaling could resolve.  Journaling will send all of the mail to a mailbox or mailboxes.  Exchange 2003 does not allow for granular journal, as it can only be configured per database.
Then, I called my guys on the floor, and told them to tell everyone they will experience intermittent problems for the next four hours. This was at 9AM London time.
It's signed off and completed now, and I'm running a full backup across every computer, just to get a snapshot of our systems on Friday 13th just in case. Thanks for your time, and efforts, I think I like this site alot

You can not. i a server is responsible for a specific domain, and an email originates internally, it dimply does not leave the server. Standard behavior.  There is no way to make it generally send a copy to an external source.
