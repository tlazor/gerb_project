In some cases of fault cause of power or Temperature in systems with bad airflow, this will make the left devices to work harder than in optimal Status raid.
All things considered, if you account for the lower performance of RAID 6 and it's still an option and RAID 10 isn't an option, then I'd say go with RAID 6 and keep at least one cold spare on a shelf somewhere.
Have you performance-tested your applications against a RAID5 array running in degraded mode during a rebuild?  If not, I think you would find they don't perform very well at all.  In some high-i/o performance critical applications, this could mean the application is essentially down until the rebuild is complete.  And with very large capacity drives, that could be a very long time.  The goal should be to avoid that rebuild situation if possible.  
From a performance perspective, you can't use the two interchangeably. RAID 6 has a higher write penalty than RAID 5, so your writes will suffer. Also, RAID 6 with two degraded drives in the array (2nd worst case to a complete failure) will perform miserably during a rebuild.
if 2 fails then cpu is not going higher again but disk goes high again since lode is balanced to 4 disk
Assuming RAID 10 isn't an option, from a strict redundancy standpoint, I would prefer RAID 6 with a cold spare over RAID 5 with a hot spare. The odds of two simultaneous failures are low, but RAID 6 also cuts down on UREs by having better parity data.
My opinion is to use hot spare ONLY if you have more than 1 raid Volumes in same system so you will be able to use a hot spare in all raid volumes.
I go with ewwhite`s answer regarding the rebuild time issue. But when rebuild time is no issue I would use all 8 disks in the raid 5 - that will give even more speed (in normal circumstances). If one drive goes down - hot swap with a new one (this assumes the disks are hot-swappable).
