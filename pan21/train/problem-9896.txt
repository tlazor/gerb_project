Can anyone tell me how to get to the options for the Metro version of IE, specifically to change the home page?
There appear to be two copies of Internet Explorer in Windows 8; the Metro version, and the normal version. The Internet Options settings do not appear to apply to the Metro version of IE; and the Metro IE does not appear to have a way to configure it.
The difference is that now you will see the traditional Internet Explorer and crucially, that cog at the top where you can make your internet options.
There is no home button or hotkey for Metro IE10. I recommend you use IE10 through the desktop if you want homepage functionality. If you want to know where the settings menu is on Metro IE10, just use (Win + i).
the only way to sort of create a homepage for the metro page is to open IE. Then type the site you want to be your homepage in the address bar below, when the page is displayed click the pin button to the right.  This will bring a box up - click pin to start.  This will pin that page to your IE button.  Next time you open IE it will refresh to the page that you pinned to it.  This is the closet you will get to a homepage.
