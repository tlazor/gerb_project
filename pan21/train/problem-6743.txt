If you're watching it with tcpdump, you should be able to know the user who's logging in and the source port.  The former gives you the ability to change credentials one-by-one until the problematic queries change which login they use, at which point you'll know their source.  The source port lets you both know whether the remote UID is zero (if src port is <1024), and it also gives you the ability to use netstat -ntp (*nix) or netstat -nto (Windows) to determine which PID is actually generating the query.
I suspect that this is mk-query-digest misinterpreting the TCP traffic.  Reconstructing the traffic as an observer on the sidelines, due to out-of-order packets, dropped packets, retransmits, and so on, is never an exact science.  When there are a lot of errors in what mk-query-digest sees, it can sometimes interpret the traffic in spurious ways and appear to find things that might not exist.
I would suggest digging into the tcpdump output manually.  It is tedious, and the protocol is hard to decode manually, but if you dump some data to a file and then mk-query-digest it, mk-query-digest will tell you the byte offset in the file where it finds the sample query it prints out.  This should let you narrow in on one packet, and with the protocol docs from the MySQL internals manual, you ought to be able to see if that packet really is the alleged RESET.  I believe that the RESET is probably related to the binary (prepared statement) protocol, if it's real; if it's spurious, I have no guesses.
