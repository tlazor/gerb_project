When I do my backups I rsync the data partition, so I don't need to worry about separate backup processes for linux and windows.
I have moved my Windows user profile to a separate partition in order to share it with my linux install. I have originally tried to make a NTFS formatted data partition, but this creates some issues on linux (the worst one being apparently that I have no sound after logging in). 
Going the other direction and mounting ntfs from linux is pretty easy, especially if you are doing read-only. The best way is to update your fstab, but there are a variety of options described here
I have an ext3 partition that I use as a data partition in both linux and windows via ext2fsd. I've been doing this for 5+ years and it works well. Typically in linux I symlink between home directory folders/profile and corresponding folders on that data partition. Doing a complete symlink of the home directory is not advisable in case you want to boot without the data directory attached.
My next approach would be to format the data partition with ext4 and use ext2fsd to "mount" it in Windows. ext2fsd seems to be reasonably fast for storing my user profile, although it does not support Windows acls.
