So basically, check if you have a cable going from one port to another on the same switch, or to another switch connected to the first one, and disconnect it. If you have managed switches, you should enable (r)STP to avoid such issues - with STP enabled, you can actually achieve redundancy with a loop - but when all is functioning correctly, one connection will be disabled by the switch itself).
When a switch recieves a broadcast packet (like ARP), it sends it out through all ports. If you have a looped cable (from one port to another in the same broadcast domain), that packet comes back to the switch, and is broadcasted again through all ports (and comes back again, and again,...).
And turned out that one Wi-Fi router was breaking down all my network. I haven't recently explained why it had done this. Because all unnecessary functions were turned off , actually it worked as a wireless switch ( as a bridge ). Have you any suppositions about it?
I had a case in which the router was spamming a range of ARP requests for IP addresses that didn't exist on the LAN (10.0.0.30-10.0.0.50). I suspected that a device on the network was trying to communicate with those IP addresses. I mirrored the Ethernet traffic between my switch and router to another port to monitor all requests from the wired LAN to the router. The culprit ended up being a Canon Printer/Scanner network utility that was hammering the router for requests to these IP addresses that did not exist.
The router could be checking for unknown/self-declared IP addresses in its range of DHCP entries, but more than likely you have a device trying to communicate with the IP address 10.162.8.75 at a fast rate and your router is trying to find that address.
Well, I have used binary search :) Sequentially disconnected ports in my main switch (10.162.0.250). So I found out the number of the floor, where the problem was. Then doing the same actions with the switches on the floor I found the room. I haven't found any loop.
