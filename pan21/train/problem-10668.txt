You might want to consider installing OpenVPN-AS Server -- we run it on Ubuntu and it's great.  It installs quickly and painlessly, and has an intuitive web interface for configuration and monitoring.  It handles setting up the interfaces transparently and even configures appropriate iptables rules for you.  Up to 2 concurrent users are free, and more are cheap ($5/user/yr).  Clients can download a pre-configured, customized config file (*.nix) or setup package (Windows) from the web interface.  
I don't think you need to use a bridge for what you want to do.  Have you tried just setting up a normal OpenVPN server?
Also you need to run at system startup this script(insert it in /etc/init.d/ and symlink in /etc/rcX.d/ in your ubuntu distro ) for setting up your bridge:
Alternatively, you could run pfSense in a VM (runs great under KVM in Ubuntu) or put it on a separate box (it doesn't need much for hardware) and take advantage of the L2TP, OpenVPN, or PPTP VPN servers built in.  Again, this would take some of the pain out of the configuration and setup, though you would need to set up KVM if you went that route.
