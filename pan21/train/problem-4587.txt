Personally at this point it became what I was going to make of the learning experience.  I may have spent more time than was needed to complete the project but the general point was the learning experience.  This of course is my own opinioin, remember that people learn differently than others. Some can read a book and simply "get it" while others need to get their hands dirty to really learn. I highly recommend asking the individual how they best learn so you may set them up for success.  You could also set him up with VMPlayer and load up a few different flavors of Linux which you may use in your area.
The best way I learned Linux was being thrown into it.  I was given a project on a non-production system which required learning many different steps both basic and advanced system administration work.  From there I was able to use the wonderful world of Google to learn much of my tasking as well as reading "A Practical Guide to Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux"  This was one of the most helpful books I came across.
