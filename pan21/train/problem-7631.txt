But surprisingly the boot order automatically changes when I reboot my laptop after saving the changes I made. Also ubuntu is not installed on my laptop currently. I had installed it previously but then removed it, completely formatted whole disk and installed Windows first and then on it installed Fedora. I don't understand still why this Intel UNDI message appears. Is it something related to "phantom" ubuntu entry that appears in the boot order? Please help me.
I searched for the similar problem on Internet and they told to reorder my boot order. I did reorder my boot order as follow:
you can define a boot order in your bios that i.e. includes your HDD as the first booting option "but" if your HDD is not "bootable" (OS not installed, OS damaged, MBR damaged, etc) then the BIOS will try other options from the booting list. This list many times has by default booting from the "net" as the last option. When booting from the NET fails you see that UNDI message you get.
I have Lenovo G580 laptop. I have installed two operating systems, namely, Windows 7 and Fedora 20. When my laptop boots it shows a message as "Intel UNDI PXE-2.0 (build 083) and blah blah...".
