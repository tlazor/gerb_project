Do you need a perfect audit trail, where each and every event can be traced back to both a specific administrator AND either an authorised change number or an incident number? 
You can assign ownership of tasks, the updates are realtime, you can mention members (and get email updates) and there's a nice accounting/logging of task activity. Plus, this is a good visual representation of outstanding tasks. Plus, the checklists are invaluable.
It depends for a large part on what you want to achieve there and how much you willing to invest with regards to time, money, effort and changing habits.
Because that introduces a significant overhead both for your engineering and operations teams, as well as the associated audit team that is required. 
Working in a team of a few hundred sysadmins, DBA's and developers distributed over the world, I find a mailing lists with a good search interface very useful for notifying each other of changes. Add jabber for more instant communication needs and a wiki for documentation and you're good to go.
