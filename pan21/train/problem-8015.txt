Depending on your Excel version there may be other ways to deal with the data, for example, in Excel 2010 and later you could use Power Query to load, clean and format the data before displaying it in the sheet. That will give you more control and you won't be exposed to Excel's defaults getting things wrong.
If you write the Value 182E00301 before Formatting the Cell as Text, Excel will recognize it as Scientific numbers with E and not Text,that is why it become in Excel 1.82E+303 even if you change the Format later to Text (after writing it) it will stay the same.  
Everything is shown as expected except one value: 182E00301 for some reason excel convert it to 1.82E+303 I understand that sometimes it recognize text as numbers but I defined the column as text not as scientific. What can I do?
I can't reproduce that behaviour. For me, the value shows as expected, even when the cell format is "General".
To force a text display, you can edit the cell and prepend the value with a single quote (or apostrophe).
