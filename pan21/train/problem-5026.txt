The router will enable you to route between the two sites and this will be your responsibility. Basically, they will provide you a path to the remote site and it will be up to you to setup the route path based on the IP range they give you.
The service provider will install their equipment on both sites which will support the protocol that they will  use. You will need to use a router that supports NAT and a firewall would also be advantageous for security reasons.
Unless you are going to lay your own cabling and connect the sites together, you will need to speak to a service provider to connect these two up. Usually the WAN connection will be managed by the provider with a guaranteed SLA which will be included in the service contract. Anything connected to the service provider equipment on the customer side, will be your responsibility to manage, but the actual link between the two sites will be the service provider's responsibility to maintain and manage and give you a satisfying service.
