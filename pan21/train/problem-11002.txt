With the little 7" hdmi tv, this one SD card install boots but i can not see any text on the screen.  I know it boots fine because I can SSH into it and I can plug it into the 32" tv (which is how I normally use it) and I can see the splash screen and console output fine.
Once again my problem is that this one SD card boots fine, but i can not see any output when I plug it into a little 7" hdmi... its as if wheezy thinks its still using the 1920x1080 resolution and Im only able to see a small portion of the screen. I've been tinkering with the config settings for console fonts as I'm getting older and that little give me a headache.
Have you just tried copying the config.txt file from the working card to the other? If that doesn't fix it it's probably a firmware issue. Copy start.elf, bootcode.bin, and fixup.dat from the working card to the other one to test it out. (Making a backup before copying is recommended.)
...using raspbian wheezy edition (the original back when it was new and sid was the only alternative), a 32" HD tv and a little 7" HD tv 
I have a second SD card with the same install of wheezy and if I plug it into the 7" tv it boots as expected(I can see the color splash screen and the console output as debian comes alive).
