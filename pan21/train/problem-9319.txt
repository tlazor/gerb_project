It seems like, your approach is correct, you should purchase Multi-domain Wildcard certificate to protect sub-domains from different sites (*.mydomain1.com, *.otherdomain1.org, *.yetanotherdomain.net, etc.).
First you should request Multi-Domain Wildcard SSL certificate for any of your main domain using asterisk (*). i.e. *.mydomain1.com
If your main domains and sub-domains exist on same server, you will need to install certificate only once. But any of your domain(s)/sub-domain(s) is on another server, you will require to reissue certificate and install it on different server. Kindly note, some providers offer free re-issuance while few charge for it, so confirm first.
Afterwards, you should add additional domains *.otherdomain1.org  and *.yetanotherdomain.net to same SSL certificate. To cover all these domains in single certificate, you will require to purchase one more SAN (as you have mentioned about default pack is of two domains). I would suggest to check this post, if you have any confusions regarding the best suitable certificate upon your requirement.
