If you know some more information about what your input looks like, there are very likely to be some heuristic optimizations you can put on top of this algorithm. A simple example is ignoring any collection containing two points with distance greater than $2\cdot R$.
Here is a slightly-better-than-raw-brute-force algorithm for $D$-dimensional Euclidean space. It's about as trivial as you can get with this kind of problem short of "check all subsets of points for being in a disk of radius at most $R$", but I figure it's nontrivial enough to serve as a baseline for future answers.
It follows that you can enumerate every collection of $1, 2, \ldots, D+1$ points, compute the appropriate disk, check that its radius is at most $R$, and then count the number of points in it. You can compute the disk in time $O(D)$ in each case, and you can naively count the points inside the sphere in $O(n\cdot D)$ time. This gives an overall time of $O(D\cdot n^{D+2})$.
A first intuition is to check all possible balls centered at $x_i$. It may not be optimal, but intuitively it might be possible to prove a approx ratio.
Suppose you have a disk that contains a collection of points, say the optimal disk that you're looking for. Unless there are points on its boundary, you can wiggle this disk around/shrink its radius to contain the exact same collection of points. Hence there can be many optimal choices of the disk. The main idea here is to focus only on disks that are easy to describe, namely those which are determined by some points on the boundary. With this restriction, we'll only need to consider a finite number of disks, and the rest of the algorithm will just be to enumerate all of these disks and count how many points each contains.
As my original question was asking for literature and scientific references, I consider posting a matching reference as a self-answer to this question:
I have found an article discussing an approximation attempt and lower bounds for both the exact and the approximated problem in the $D$-dimensional euclidean  space.
So now focus on a particular disk containing a fixed set of points. With translations, you can get one point on the boundary. We now consider some cases, which I'll outline for $D = 3$, though they generalize.
