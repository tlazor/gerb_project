The real issue is that none of the existing clone tools (mrepo is the primary example) is they blindly copy the entirety of a repo.  We don't want that for cherry picking.  If you then try to use yumdownloader or such, you find that it DOES look for dependencies but it only compares against INSTALLED PACKAGES on the current server.  You can't tell yumdownloader to compare against a local package repo.  
I have mechanisms for cloning RPM repos from the 'net.  But what I really want is a way to clone PART of a repo.  So far I haven't found any such existing mechanism.
The reason for the second requirement is that we only want the absolute minimal infection from outside sources in our local cache of RPMs. We want to run as much of the official RHEL RPMs as we can and only augment as needed.  The problem with blindly cloning an entire third party RPM repo is that sometimes they re-write official packages or add newer versions of official packages.  And unless those versions are direct dependencies for our target package, we do not want to those packages in our local repo cache.
