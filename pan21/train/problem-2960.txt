I've been very happy with the performance of the device up until recently when either the number of files has cross a threshold of the capacity of the disk has cross a threshold (I'm not sure which)
as an experiment, I dismounted the disk (flushing caches, verified with free). Then from a command prompt I navigated deep into the directory structure.  All told this directory (and its children) had only about 3200 files contained beneath it, and at this point 'free' showed >117MB of free memory
I understand the balances of cache vs free memory, and how the kernel considers an empty page a bad page - however 115MB of cached content from a directory of 3000 files points to a serious gap in my understanding.  I'm hoping someone will help me understand whats happening
My assumption is that the organizational structure I've chosen on disk for my files has somehow hurt the inode caches ability to remain zippy.
I'm hoping to get a lead on something to investigate.  The disk performance has dropped significantly,  the device was zipping along quite well and then all of a sudden performance dropped like a rock.  
on the disk are many small files,  due to the nature of the writing application files are organized in a very balanced way - no leaf node directory has more than 200 files and there are just over 800,000 files.
