Also, I'm fairly certain that the Mint install willl automatically configure for dual boot, even if installing it on the Linux drive. You'll just avoid wiping the Windows bootloader, eliminating the need to fix it later if you stop dual booting.
I than proceeded to make a small partition of 100mb on drive [0] (i know its a lot for GRUB) and I tried installing MINT again, and it did install along with supposadly GRUB, but when I rebooted the computer, Windows 7 came up just like before and there was no noticable changes.
I suggest installing Grub on your Linux drive, and leaving the Windows bootloader on your Windows drive. Then either select your boot drive with the BIOS quick-select menu (usually F2/F10/F12/Esc at boot time), or manually edit your grub configuration to add a Windows boot option.
I have an older copy of Acronis Disk Director that I'm sure could get the job done, but I wanted to use something a little less invasive like GRUB. Although I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. Any hints or suggestions are much appreciated
Bring up your system into a Linux rescue console and execute fdisk, issue the p command to check, change if necessary then reboot.
So I have done so except for drive [1], the Linux drive. I wanted to install it, and I started with Mint Linux Debian, just for fun, I was going to partition the drive into two so I could run Debian and then another distro, at this time Mint. SO upon installing it, it asked me where do I want GRUB installed, so I said install it on drive [0], the drive containing Windows. However, it told me that I don't have enough space on that drive (if i remember correctly). Either way, it failed to install GRUB, and the installation cancelled.
Have you changed which partition has the boot flag set?  Chances are that the Win7 partition on your drive [0] is still the one flagged as bootable.
