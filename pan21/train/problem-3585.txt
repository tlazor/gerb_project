I really just want to block one app from them. For example, let's say it's skout.com android app that they are using.
I know you didn't ask but I am going to say this anyway; IMO, you should change the security settings and password on the router. When the person wants to use the network, they will have to ask. If they download the APP again, they lose access. If this is your device, take it away from the person borrowing it.
Part of the problem is the APP in question is down-loadable from multiple sources, not just the SKOUT site. So blocking the web site won't do the trick. Not knowing how the APP connects specifically it can not be easily blocked by the firewall. 
Depending on the setup of your router's firewall, you should be able to block specific sites and/or IP addresses.  You will need to consult the help manual/files for your model of router to see what features it will support.  If you want to block their Android entirely, you might consider implementing MAC filtering on your router, it it's WIFI configuration will support it and block their phone entirely.
I blocked the Android from connected to router with the Wifi, but some-how they got it to work again. I know they was searching for static IP and how to get one. So I'm assuming they learned how to switch to the static IP and that is how theyre device works again.
Is it possible to block skout.com by there router and that will stop the skout.com APP from connecting to the internet?
