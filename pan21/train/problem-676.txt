There is no way to "release" a key from a computer. You get a certain number of registrations, and then you have to call Microsoft and have them get you an activation code over the phone each time you activate the key again.
I did some product key changes a few years back, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it, or if there's something else that needs to or should be done.
Assuming someone wants to release/liberate their Windows product key from a pc that they are going to sale, what is the right way to do it, so that the key can be used on the next system that is bought?
Before selling a computer, you should wipe it using a tool such as DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke) or similar. If you're not selling it with software, leave it as-is after the wipe.
However, if it is a NEW or Upgrade license, then you will as Music2MyEar mention wipe the computer. You would not want any private data on the computer when selling it. You can reinstall Windows on the computer without any product key (if using Vista/7). This will allow the new owner to purchase the same copy of Windows that you had installed (ie Home Premium) and then enter the license key of their newly purchased version of Windows. This way, you protect yourself by wiping the data, and release any software license violations from the new owner.
