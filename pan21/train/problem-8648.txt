The later suggestion to "use hard links" doesn't work, as I believe there are no "directory hard links" in NTFS.
I know this topic is rather old, however, the problem still exists. OneDrive (which seems like a direct ripoff of Dropbox originally, which has the same problem) does not sync symlinked files, if the source folder or file is not within the OneDrive folder. 
So the easiest solution is, to put the original (source) files into the OneDrive folder and symlink it to whereever else destination you want to edit them. You can edit them in two places and OneDrive will still sync them. Of course, if the destination folder is again synched (e.g. by Dropbox) then that one won't sync it, but that's a rather rare case where you're using OneDrive and Dropbox. 
Works for me. I can edit the files from within any of the two folders and OneDrive syncs them fine. I can also edit them online (using OneDrive for Business which syncs into a SharePoint library but that shouldn't matter). Should also work with Dropbox. If you need it the other way around, switch source and destination. 
Per this thread in Microsoft's forums, it looks like OneDrive was getting notified of file change events from aliased (junction/symlink) paths around 5/31/2017 (see reply marked best response), but on 1/17/2018 somebody reported that they were broken, and the author of the reply marked best response seemed to confirm that.
There are a couple mentions of workarounds in that thread -- OneDriveBully to manually trigger a (full?) sync of OneDrive periodically, and generic folder sync utilities to 2-way-sync the two directories (incurring 2x disk space and probably lots of headaches when it has to, ie. handle conflicts). I don't like any of them.
