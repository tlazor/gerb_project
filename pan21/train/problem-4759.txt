But the question still stands -- can Apache return a 404 status header and still return valid XHTML after that?
This problem used to not occur until 2 weeks ago, and the only thing that has changed in 14 months on the site has been the Apache system updates like normal. (I will admit that the client asked me to edit the homepage template and show a message to IE users about the problem.)
With Apache, is it possible to send a 404 status header, but then send valid content? Because that's what's happening right now with http://doubleabody.com on a2hosting.com right now. The web logs show all connections (besides the homepage) to be a 404 status, but then the browsers are receiving valid content after that. This causes something strange to happen. In IE, when it has Friendly HTTP Errors turned on, it's displaying the 404. In IE, with Friendly HTTP Errors turned off, it's not displaying the 404 and is displaying the content just fine. In all other browsers, they seem to be seeing valid content and ignoring the 404 error that the server is recording.
I want to prove that this is a misconfigured Apache config. I have downloaded the database and the hosting files for this WordPress site, and I'm now going to troubleshoot to see if the same code also has a problem on my workstation.
