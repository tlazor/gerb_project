This way I have quite easy access to the files and the backups are kept up to date. (The two NAS units would be set-up to replicate each othet)
I would not recommend this. I had several failed SSDs by now. The difference to a spinning drive is that the SSDs suddenly stopped working, from one second to the next (at least in my systems). I had no chance to access the data in any way.
Additional note: SSDs are super-fast, that's why you need to connect via USB 3.0 or eSATA to get the speed advantage they provide.
Just one side note: for unimportant and cloud accessible data like programs, games and system I would never even think about ssd, hdd is enough as a convenience backup.
Of course, nobody should rely just on one backup media but spread it locally and on different media.
In contrast to failing hard drives, which generally let you know several weeks or hours or minutes before they die (either they make noise or the SMART values kick-off an alarm). I rarely had a failing hard drive which was unable to recover at least some of the data.
My reasons are as following: for really important data costs should matter much less, and cost is the main obstacle for now, secondly, backup speed is much higher compared to a hdd (from an ssd at least), this time alone is worth something, thirdly, failure rates of hdds have been increasing a lot in recent years because were are getting close to physical limitations for mechanical disks whereas ssds can still improve a lot.
If you're not totally paranoid (like me), then a cloud service would be a good alternative to the separate SSD.
And if you are really paranoid, I would recommend keeping the most important data on a few CD-R's in a safe with a USB CD drive.
The extra money you spend on an SSD I would invest in a second hard drive as a backup for the backup drive.
With 1tb SSD drives for around 600 usd just around the corner the answer to this question is a even bigger yes.
