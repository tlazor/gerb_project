In either case, if you want to keep certain DNS infomation cached ready for immediate retrieval whenever a WWW browser attempts the DNS lookup, simply look it up beforehand in the normal way.  (Use a program that uses the system-provided DNS client library routines.  Programs like the deeply flawed nslookup have their own separate DNS client libraries, and won't do the job.)  Be aware that several organizations intentionally use very short TTL values on their DNS data.  They want you to look things up afresh every 30 seconds (or whatever).
People are obsessed with the hosts file, even though the idea was superseded in the early 1980s by the DNS.  It's not even as if those same people are running feature-poor operating systems like one of the DOS family or DOS-Windows, either.  Nowadays, even the Windows users amongst the hosts-obsessed are running Windows NT, which comes with a caching DNS client as a standard part of the operating system.  When the caching DNS client is enabled — as it is by default — all DNS lookups by applications are cached locally.  
Operating systems other than (the workstation editions of) Windows NT come with caching DNS proxy servers (djbdns, BIND, MaraDNS, and the like for Unices and Linux, for example), that not only cache information locally, but that are fully capable of performing the entirety of DNS query resolution locally, too.  Run the DNS proxy server as a resolving proxy server, point the DNS client library at it, and there's no need to worry about the foibles of anyone else's proxy servers at all.
