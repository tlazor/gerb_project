Run "show spanning-tree summary" command on both switches and on first line it will show operational mode. It should be "Switch is in rapid-pvst mode". If no - than do "spanning-tree mode rapid" on both stacks.
An interesting counter from Gi1/0/28 (Site A) are the input errors on the interface. Might be a layer 1 issue but since you do not have any crc errors and the realibility is 255/255 it may be due to repluging cables.
You may also remove the "access vlan configuration" since your trunk configuration with native vlan 666 will be preferred. Also change your allowed vlan configuration to match the primary link. I do not know which vlans you actually use, but inconsistency may become a big pain in case your primary link fails.
First of all you may want to remove the unnecessary spanning-tree configuration on your secondary uplink. STP calculates the cost metric based on the link speed. Your 100Mbit/sec CU uplink has a default cost of 19 and your primary 1Gbit/sec SM Fibre uplink got a cost of 4, so no need to set it manually.
Since there are no obvious configuration issues I would recommand re-enabling the port and posting the output of:
