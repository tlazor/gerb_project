An Exchange 2013 default setup for a connector that has "Anonymous users" security setting checked grants the following rights to the connector:
"Accept any sender" is obviously required, because otherwise incoming emails won't get through at all, also "SMTP Submit" is required. but what about "ms-Exch-SMTP-Accept-Authoritative-Domain-Sender"? The right is explained here as "Allow to send as any domain hosted on the connected server's Exchange organization", or any domain in Get-AcceptedDomain that's listed as "Authoritative". I expect that this right is superfluous, and frankly detrimental to maintain, yet revoking this makes Exchange connector to display that no one has enough rights to send mail through this connector. Still, incoming mail flow does not get interrupted from this.
Why is this right present by default on anonymous-enabled Exchange connectors? Is it safe enough to remove this right, as no external devices should be sending mail through this unsecured connector (it only has STARTTLS as security option, and no auth settings are defined by default)? And, should I ever allow this right on any unsecured connector at all, provided the connector is facing the Internet? Also what about the rights for "create public folder"?
