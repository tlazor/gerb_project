Finally, as these effects can add unwanted noise to your signal, use the visual EQ to process to your taste/system.
If AUDelay does not give you enough of a delay, there a many free plugins that are GarageBand-compatible and have longer delay times. Voxengo is one of many software developers that offer a free sound delay plug-in (in Mac and Windows compatible versions) and their plug-in offers a 3 second delay (http://www.voxengo.com/product/sounddelay/). Installation is drag and drop, just check the website and follow the directions.
If you need more delay, you can click the ‘Master Track’ tab above the track ‘edit’ tab and, using the same procedure outlined in step 5 above, you add another delay unit to your chain and achieve a full 8-second delay.
This can be done using Audio Hijack Pro.  First, set up your audio source and hijack it.  Now, go to the effects tab.  Add "AudioUnit Effect > Apple > AUDelay".  In the pop-up window, set dry/wet mix to 100%, lowpass cutoff frequency at 22,050, and move the orange dot in the graph to 0% feedback with a 2 second delay (move the dot down and to the right).  Since 2 seconds is the max delay per AUDelay effect, just set up 5 of them.
On a Mac, this (delaying a radio signal in order to sink with the MLB, or any other, broadcast) can also be accomplished with GarageBand and delay effects that are included in the software.
Run a male-to-male 3.5 mm cable from the headphone or line out from your radio to the audio input of your Mac (usually located next to the headphone out on Mac). Turn the audio on and set volume to about 1/3.
