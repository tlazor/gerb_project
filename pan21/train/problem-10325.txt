You may also be interested in trying the Dynamic Virtual Terminal Manager. It does something similar to the screen features highlighted in a previous answer, but is in my opinion easier to work with. Here are some of the default keybindings:
Don't forget the vim quickfix commands for the edit-compile cycle (see :help quickfix and :help make). 
You could try the Conque Shell plugin.  Haven't tried this yet myself but it's got a high (1:3) rating-to-download ratio, and claims to do just what you want.  The actual rating is pretty decent, especially since it's only been around since 2009-09, and only hit version 1.0 in February.  The advantage of using this over the VIM-Shell patch is that you don't have to patch vim; you just install the plugin in your ~/.vim directory.
How do I have vim and a console in the same window? For example, I am splitting up the vim window into multiple windows (vertically or horizontally). What I want is to have the code window on the left side, and the interpreter or console or whatever on the right side, so I can easily switch between them. How does that work? Is there something there for this?
DVTM also supports mouse integration; simply click on a terminal window in order to select it. Screenshots are available at the website linked above.
Maybe it's a radical suggestion but consider using a tiling window manager. In the following screenshot you can see vim in the left column, with the quickfix window opened, and on the right an xterm used to launch and test the application. The window manager used is called wmii.
