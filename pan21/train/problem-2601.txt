I'm looking to buy a Lenovo Miix 3-10 (80HV0025PH) Hybrid Windows tablet for school. As it only comes in 64GB eMMC (other options are only 32GB), I am thinking that it would not be enough storage space for me, as this will be my main and only computer. This website, the official shop site and some other sources state that I can expand the storage with an sd card of upto another 64GB. Normally I would be satisfied with this setup but if I have the option to put a 128GB card then why not?
Yes the 128gb MicroSD works fine. In addition I am using a 128GB USB to improve the storage. Both work well together. In essence you will get 64gb internal, 128gb microsd and 128gb USB
Yes, it should work fine... but be aware that filesystem may suppot only 64GB of that 128. In the worst scenario, you would have to create partition that would only have half of whole size, but that shouldn't be necessary in most of cases.
The main question is if it can support 64GB then it must mean it's a SDXC compatible card slot, so in turn it should (?) be able to make use of the 128GB card. I can't afford to physically test this myself since there is a no refunds policy if I willingly buy the 128GB card knowing about the 64GB limit of the device (I'm gonna be buying from the same store.
This means there was around 1 year for MicroSDXC cards of 128GB capacity to be released and tested. The fact the site is stating it will only support up to 64GB this long after 128GB cards were released, I would suggest it is not fully supported and you won't get the full amount of space available. I would therefore recommend going for a 64GB you can be certain will work.
I'm not quite sure if this was the correct board for this topic. But I had been searching for an answer and found no luck in with regard to this specific question..
As a general rule, yes. This page is the official compatibility chart from the SD association. Your device states:
However - The release date of the Lenovo Miix 3-10 was February 2015. 128GB MicroSDXC cards were released early 2014.
