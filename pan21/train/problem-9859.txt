Yes, it looks like your firewall is blocking traffic to the stun server. This isn't unexpected in big enterprise environments.
The ask to your IT administrator would be to "open access to a remote server listening on UDP ports 3478 and 3479".  You may find, if they do open those ports, that the enterprise firewall acts as a symmetric NAT and doesn't do a good job of enabling WebRTC connections.  YMMV.
I am the maintainer of stun.stunprotocol.org and the stuntman code itself. Just happened to catch your question here a bit late. I normally monitor the stun questions on stackoverflow.com, but only occasionally make it to serverfault.
STUN, by default, works on UDP ports, not TCP.  You could try specifying --protocol tcp on the stunclient command line to see if that makes any difference.  But WebRTC only uses the UDP mode.  One cheezy idea to try would be to host your own stun server on UDP port 53 (same as DNS) and see if that works.  Again, enterprises may restrict DNS traffic to well known or internal servers.
