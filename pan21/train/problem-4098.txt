So, I've looked at psexec, which is almost ideal, except only seems triggerable from another windows machine.  .. I suppose it's not impossible to have a windows server trigger the workstation shutdown procedure, but that's not ideal. 
As part of an "emergency" system shutdown procedure, I'd like a mechanism of triggering a remote shutdown, from a Linux controller (which is in turn, a service orchestration tool).  The word "emergency" is in quotes because it's not really an emergency, but still need a mechanism other than simply telling the users to turn the workstations off.
What I'd like, ideally.. Is a program that runs as a service, with local (or domain) Administrator privileges, listening on a port, for a SSL-encrypted, RESTful API call like, http://workstation:8888/admin/shutdown?key=secretsharedkey.
Do I need to write something in C#.net, or is there a tool out there for cross-platform triggering of a shutdown of a windows workstation? 
You can use winexe. It uses a RPC call to install a service on the target computer, and then uses this service to execute commands on it. You can specify the credentials, and the Linux server doesn't have to be a member of the domain.
