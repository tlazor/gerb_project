I do not think what I am trying to do is possible, but I could not find any documentation on this. I have an INSTEAD OF UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE that always inserts data into a history table before performing the DML operation. So I created triggers that performed my insert into the history table and then I created 3 IF statements to figure out if the original operation was an INSERT UPDATE or DELETE operation to continue the original operation.
Is there a way to perform my history insert and then tell SQL Server to continue with the original INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE without writing those myself? See my code  below. We are using the standard edition of SQL Server, so no CDC to help with logging changes. Thank you.
You could just use a FOR trigger instead of an INSTEAD OF trigger. The records, as they were before the DML statement, are still in the deleted table (for updates and deletes). Everything will still be contained in an implicit transaction.
You are defining an ordinary AFTER trigger. So use an AFTER trigger, not an INSTEAD OF trigger. The cases where you want to use 'instead of' triggers are, basically, none.
In my opinion, INSTEAD OF triggers are really handy when you don't want to run the original DML, or on views.
