I tried complete uninstall and fresh install but the error exists. Even I tried to force a full download of database (by pushing a very old version of bases.cav file as current) but it fails at ‘Finalizing’ stage at 90%. I even ran built in Comodo Diagnostics utility and it did not report anything.
I am using Comodo Internet Security including Antivirus v5.8.213334.2131 Free version. Virus signature database v 25399.  OS Windows XP Sp3
Apparently the internet connection is just fine. This message appears misleading. I have tried several times over last couple of days but same result. Very little info is available on Comodo Forums. A user who faced similar problem was able to solve it by re-installing the anti virus. 
I am trying to update this signature online. It downloads the latest parches as usual and starts applying but prolongs at 90% for over 5 minutes and then pops up a message stating   ‘Failed to update the virus signature database. Please check your internet connection and try again later’
