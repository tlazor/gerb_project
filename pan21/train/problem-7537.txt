I agree with you in not wanting to use CONVERT() on every field. I feel that the correct place for formatting region-dependant items is on the client. The web page or application should be formatting dates and times as appropriate to the user's locale. This can take advantage of any localisation features of the client programming language - something that T-SQL CONVERT() can not do.
This is the setting for British English.  You can see all of them displayed in the syslanguages system view.  syslanguages also contains the default date format.  In the case of British English it is dmy.  American English is mdy.
As stated in the comments, dates are not stored as "dates".  They are actually stored as numbers.  So there is no need to worry about that side of things.  You can change the default output though by changing your language setting.
As an aside, in case you didn't already know, the format for inserting dates can be controlled with SET DATEFORMAT.
As stated by other posters, datetime values are stored as datetime values, not as strings. If you want to get technical, they are stored as two integers - one representing days and the other representing clock ticks (3.33ms for the datetime datatype).
A further aside that is relevant to your situation: I would recommend passing dates into SQL Server in ISO 8601 format (or a close approximation to it), as that's the least likely to be misinterpreted.  SQL Server 2000 seems happy with accepting dates in yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format.
