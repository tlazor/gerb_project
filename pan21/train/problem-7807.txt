Well it depends entirely on what you are looking to do. Did you want to reinstall Ubuntu? If so, probably the easiest way of getting it all up and working again is to go through the live install on your 10.10 disk. Just make sure that you don't accidentally wipe your XP partition. It should reinstall Grub and reconfigure it for you to have entries for both your XP partition and the newly installed Linux partition. 
I've tried burning SuperGrubDisk to CD but it doesn't boot, I get Grub Error 17. I also tried gParted but can't boot to the CD - there was some error message not being able to mount stuff.
Booting to the live disks should NOT give you grub errors, regardless of what version of Ubuntu you are running...these disks should boot straight from CD, and therefore not check your boot record. Are you sure you were booting to CD first? Are you sure the disks aren't damaged in some way? Or, if you're not dead set on 8 or 9, try using 10.04, 10.10, or 11.04(beta). 
I can't boot to any of the Live disks for 8.10. 9.04 or 9.10 but I caN boot to live disk for 10.10 (1 out of 6 times with Grub error on the other attempts)
