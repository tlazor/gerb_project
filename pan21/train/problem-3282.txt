Keltari's answer is pretty spot on. However, some of it depends on how the OS handles files currently loaded in memory.
It can be beneficial to reboot before updating.  This would finalize any updates from the OS or applications that might prevent you from running an update.
After an update is applied, you might be required to reboot to apply those updates.  Once that update is complete, new updates might be available.  This typically happens when updates have to be applied in a certain order.  If new updates are available, they might require a reboot.  This is where I think your confusion is.  This situation happens often after installing an OS, or you havent updated the OS in a long time, and there are many updates that need to be applied.
Essentially, the reason that a restart is needed is because if a file that is loaded into memory gets updated, you need a way to get the new file into memory. For some files (mainly system files) it is necessary to restart the computer, however you only need to do this once. 
From my understanding, Windows requires reboots for a lot more files because it's not as modular as Linux for example. Most updates in Linux would only require you to restart the specific service or program.
