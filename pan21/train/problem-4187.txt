You can only use 1 certificate per IP address. So you will need a certificate with all the possible domain names (or a wildcard for them) on a single cert.
Here is the (small) fly in the ointment: If the initial connection is made to the default HTTPS port (443), the browser will encounter a server certificate error before the redirect (to port 444 or 445 or ...) can happen. This will scare away most regular people attempting to reach your sites.
I am wondering if i would be able to setup all vhosts to use a different port (444, 445) for the ssl connection and then redirect each site from 443 to whatever port I have defined for the to use ssl on.  
It is possible to have more than one SSL certificate on a given IP address, even without SNI. As long as you have your web server listening on a different port (e.g. 444, 445, etc.) for each of your different domains, each domain can each have its own SSL cert while served from the same IP address. (The cert is uniquely selected by the combination of IP address and port number, before the encryption handshake occurs.)
One way around this is to tell your users to browse to your sites via regular HTTP (i.e. to port 80), as you probably would anyway. Then you simply do your rewrite/redirects from there, i.e.
You can't use alternate ports unless you're going to tell your clients to use them; and that generally doesn't go over well at all.
So I have been trying to figure out how to setup multiple ssl sites using only 1 ip.  The issue that I am seeing is when you have multiple vhosts using ssl the first site that has ssl is the one that is used for the rest of the sites.
