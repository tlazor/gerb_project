I figure that if I'm getting data from the previous customer on my machine, it's likely that the next customer might be getting my data, thus I'd like to have a way of testing whether the disc has been scrubbed appropriately of any previous data, to know what I'm up for.
Are there any tools for Linux, FreeBSD or OpenBSD to examine unused disc space not currently allocated by the filesystem?  The ideal tool would be capable of determining the filesystem currently used, and presenting all data, in a linear or better format, of all unused disc space; including stuff that's not necessarily adhering to the format of the filesystem currently in use (e.g., files that used to be part of other arbitrary filesystem formats).
When using managed dedicated services, either virtual or physical, where you're presented with complete control to an operating system installed on some piece of hardware you don't have physical access to, is there any good way to test whether the storage have been appropriately wiped of any data from the previous customer?
A naive approach would use dd together with hexdump -C, fgrep -v and uniq, but it's very non-trivial to distinguish which data is yours and which isn't, because we're running this on an already-formatted HDD.
