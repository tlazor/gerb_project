In general, this is not a server I would love having physical - it is so small, it makes no sense IMHO to havea machine there. Virtual would be better ;)
I would also keep longer term performance logs. Watch out for your IO (seconds / read, Seconds / write are pretty much the only relevant ones). All the rest is IO wise too vague - but once your IO starts taking longer than it should, the discs fall behind.
I would rule out a configuration issue at this point - at least as primary indicator. Something uses up your W3p ressources, now you need to find out what it is.
has some start there. This may give you a hint in case the problems are more - hm - "categorizable".
Use Perfmon's "Process" counter to see the individual attributes of the w3wp.exe process.  How much of the CPU time for the worker process is kernel time?  High kernel times could be indicative of paging, but you say you're not convinced.  Other possibilities are duff drivers.  The worker process has 23 threads active, which is good, but what are they doing?  Try SysInternals' ProcessExplorer to dig around a bit more; you can also see what TCP/IP connections are in play.  I haven't used SQL Express, but does it have memory tuning parameters, like its big brother.  Is SQL starving IIS of memory, causing excessive paging?
You could try using a program called Process Explorer to monitor individual threads running under the w3wp process. It should allow you to see what thread is causing all the damage.
