This type of question is one reason why we never buy OEM server licenses.  I want to be able to move licenses around if necessary.
If it were me, how I'd deal with this depends on what sort of disaster I was thinking of.  If it's a temporary server to run while rebuilding the original, I'd go ahead and use a VM.  Yes, it might be violating the license, but only for a short period while replacing the hard drives or whatever on the original server.  Then, if it turned out to be a dead motherboard, I'd buy a new license.  If you want to have something to fail over to and then run indefinitely, you'd need to be sure it's allowed under the OEM license, which it probably isn't.
The usual rule for OEM licenses is that if you change the motherboard, it's a different computer and you can't use the license.  Here's one article about what hardware changes in XP can require a new OEM license.
You need another license.  SQL server is the only product I am aware of with extended failover rights as part of the PUR.  However, if you bought SA on the server then you do have cold backup rights which allow you to run the products on a second server.
