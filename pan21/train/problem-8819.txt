NTP, on the other hand, synchronizes time and date on hosts. It is a protocol for transmitting time between systems, and keeping the synchronized.  
However, this is not the system clock. It's not date and time. It's the length of the periods of a fast timer running in the networking hardware. It doesn't care about date or time. It cares about how long one bit is supposed to be on the wire.
By sending a 0-1-0-1... pattern, the receiver can adjust their clock rate to read symbols correctly. This means that if the sender or receivers clock are not running at exactly the same frequency, they can still communicate, because they can determine the difference.
The point of the preamble is to make sure all receivers receive clock is synchronized, so that they have the correct length of bits in the transmission. This is achieved by sending a defined pattern. The receiving device knows what it is supposed to look like, and can adjust it internal timers to match the senders timer.
So in short, you're confusing what clock means in different contexts. When talking about operating system level, or user level, clock is usually the time and date. When talking about electronics, clock is some internal, regular timing signal, often running at high frequency. It carries no information. It's simply meant to synchronize events.
