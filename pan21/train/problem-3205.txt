I am working on a similar problem (granted I am using a different language so I'll try to only focus on principle). I basically made just a function for each part of the player that could be different at any point in the game and gave it conditions that would just add to the player's stats (I.e. Shield could be none, paper, glass, wood, or metal. Each different type added a certain number of points to the player's defense. ). I also added the currently unused ability to enchant the shield or armor or whatever (this currently is just a point system that does nothing but I'm thinking about doing something like giving a shield attack points). The only problem with this is it makes for some messy if statements. 
What you could do is make a function that reflects the player's species and one for their class. You might want to start with some base stats (jump_height = 1 strength =  3 etc.) and then have the species and classes modify them (for an elf add 2 to the jump_height). I'm not that great with graphics but I would expect them to work on the same principle.
