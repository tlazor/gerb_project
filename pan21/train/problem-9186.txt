Just some further information, many vendors only provide support for their products when they are used in a supported environment. For example JoeAccounting is the software your accounting department uses on their Windows XP computers. Say something happens and you have to re-install JoeAccounting on their computers, but you run into an issue. Right now you can call JoeAccounting support and they can help you solve the problem, in a few days from now if their policy is to only support their product on operating systems that are in support from their own vendor, then they will not be able to help you with the issue.
Many vendors utilize this policy and for good reason. If the source of the issue is something with the operating system itself, the vendor can work with the OS vendor to resolve the issue. If the OS isn't supported they can't do that.
If you are still running XP machines its not too late to upgrade, but to be honest even though the out of pocket is less to just buy Windows 7 and install it on the XP computers, it is better in the long run to buy new computers, a $1000 computer would pay itself off with increased productivity and decreased support cost in a year. Its very important even for small businesses to have life cycle's on their IT hardware and software. If you still have XP machines odds are they are 4 or more years old and that old in the business world for a computer.
