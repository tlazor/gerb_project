A partial answer, in that I don't know a nice "reason" that can be generalised, but the following graph (shameless nicked from here):
A more refine obstruction is that for every assignment of nonnegative weights for the vertices   there is no independent set that capture a fraction 1/5 (or more) of the total weight. Note that this also include the "no clique obstructions." LP-duality tells you that this obstruction is equivalent to the "fractional chromatic number" of G being larger than k. 
Lovasz found topological obstructions for k-colorability and used his theory to solve Knaser's conjecture. His theorem is the following. Let G be a connected graph, and let N(G) be a simplicial complex whose faces are subsets of V that have a common neighbors. Then if N(K) is k-connected (namely, all its reduced homology groups are 0 up to dimension k-1) then the number of colors needed to color G is at least k+3.
There are also obstructions for k-colorability of a different nature that sometimes go beyond the fractional chromatic number barrier. I will devote a separate asnwer to them.
I would suspect that for any given genus, there's a graph of a certain minimum chromatic number (see the Heawood conjecture) that doesn't follow rules 1 or 2. Of course I have no proof other than intuition.
Isn't 3-colorable, but is obviously 4-colorable (being planar), and it contains no $K_{4}$, nor any cycle with a additional vertex connected to all the cycle vertices (unless I'm missing something, but the only vertices connected to a vertex and its neighbour are in the 3-cycles). Taking it further, you could apply a version of rule 2 to get a graph of chromatic number 5.
An important obstruction for a graph to be non k-colorable is that the maximum size of an independent set is smaller than n/k, where n is the number of vertices. This is a very important obstraction. For example it implies that a random graph in G(n,1/2) has chromatic number at least n/log n.
