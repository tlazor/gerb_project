As Windows 7 is slowly getting older, you might want to consider changing to another OS. While it will receive further updates until the January of 2023 (as stated here, text is in german) for paying customers, you can either upgrade to a newer Windows OS (if you need to run software that is Windows-only) or consider trying something like Linux Mint, which should make the transition between operating systems mostly painless.
If you are interested to see what you PC is sending out, you might want to take a look at Wireshark. Check if you can legally use it in your country and stay within the legal boundaries as you use it.
Encrypt your files. A stolen file that can't be decrypted might not harm you, while unencrypted files could. Consider using Bitlocker if you are on Windows (backup your files before you do, however!)
Consider using maintained Open Source software, if available for the task at hand. While you personally might lack the time or knowledge to check it, there is at least the chance that someone checked the sources. If it is actively maintained, this (or another) someone is working on it. See this page. Money quote: 
Oh, and don't trust the Cloud. You don't need a person wearing a ski mask and a hoodie to steal your stuff if you yourself upload your files to some server for convenience.
