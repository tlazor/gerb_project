The one downside to this however is that you do have a hard limit of the number of samplers that can be used, though you can make use of texture arrays or multi-pass rendering if you need to use lots of textures. It is worth noting that older GPUs will have less texture samplers available. The modern standard is 32 textures however. Some older cards will only support 16.
I would say that a few years ago, creating a texture atlas would have been better, however now, I believe that GPUs would be more optimal at sampling from multiple different textures.
Is there any performance difference between using multiple textures and using texture atlas in splatmapping? I would want to use multiple ones beacouse tiling and changing them would be easier but performance is more important.
Though all this being said, it is still important to evaluate both options. As splatting is quite a fast operation, it may be difficult to notice a difference. If there is no measurable difference, stick with independent textures.
