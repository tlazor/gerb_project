Since the "official" CLI tool is unable to remove the filter from FltMgr, and FltMgr itself is a 'critical' driver that cannot be restarted without reboot, it would seem that there's no way to unload PROCMON23 or PROCMON24.
Standard drivers are services and you can indeed control them via net and sc. (For example, take a look at sc query beep â€“ stopping the 'beep' driver is a common way to shut up the internal PC speaker.)
In earlier Process Monitor versions (probably pre-2.3, when it still had Windows XP support), it would install a "legacy" device driver that was visible via sc, Device Manager, etc.
Current versions of Process Monitor appear to remove the driver/service configuration from registry immediately after starting the driver. You can see this by monitoring ProcMon with itself. It is possible to manually re-add the service, with type 2 (kernel FS driver) and it will immediately show up as already running.
Additionally, PROCMON23 now registers itself as a filesystem minifilter driver through the Filter Manager (FltDrv). You can see it in the output of fltmc, but attempting to externally unload it also fails (possibly because the driver doesn't have the unload routine):
But the most interesting part: After doing the above checks with procmon 3.40, I found that the latest version on the website is 3.50 (which uses a newer PROCMON24 driver). Upon starting the new version, I was informed that an older version of the driver was already on the system and that I should reboot.
So if ProcMon itself cannot unload its own driver without requiring a reboot, I think you can safely assume that you won't be able to unload it either.
