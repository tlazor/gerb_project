Even if it's not the same program doing it, it could be a similar thing where it throws an error every X seconds. Check the event viewer in your Control Panel\System and Security\Administrative Tools and see what's in Windows Logs -> System. That's where I found my culprit. 
It was then a very easy thing to look up the solution, which was that, as it turns out, the HP printer's automatic scanning facility had malfunctioned. I turned it off, and the problem was fixed.
The thing is - you can see when and what apps were focused at any given time, which is what you need. Run the app, start the timer, do your stuff while waiting for this glitch to happen, then, either look in the PaymoPlus window if you're using it, or on Timecamp web UI, if you're using that one.
2 services: Paymo3 and Timecamp, have an option of tracking the time you spend working on the PC, for billing reasons. The PaymoPlus app records active windows, and time on them, so you could then add them to specific tasks, so you can bill the client. Timecamp does the same, but automatically adds the apps to a task. 
I worked out the problem just to a downright fluke. I was doing some document work, and I happened to press Ctrl-C just as the problem occurred.  When I pressed Paste, I got this:
There are unrelated software that can help you. Because nobody really wants to know what's the active window at the moment, this feature is rarely seen in applications. Except, if you do some kind of time tracking.
I just had this problem where a window would lose focus every 5 seconds for a split second. For games where the sound turns off when the game doesn't have focus, it's super crazy annoying.
The problem for me was the  Intel Smart Connect Technology Agent that wasn't connected from my new MSI mainboard (z87-g45). Uninstalling that fixed it right away.
