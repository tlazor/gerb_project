Your results will be very similar - transferring lots of small files in general takes a lot more time than transferring one large file.  SMB2 may be poorly optimized (too chatty) for transferring many files and WAN links, but the basic performance issue you're seeing will persist, regardless of protocol.
No, that's not an SMB2 issue, it's a transferring-lots-of-small-files-over-any-protocol issue.  In addition to more network overhead, you're dealing with a lot more seek time, and essentially random reads instead of sequential reads, so the disk operations are a lot slower as well.  Test yourself with a USB flash drive or external hard drive, for example.  And if you wish, a different network protocol, like FTP.
And yes, it causes issues - SMB2 is quite chatty and not optimized for high latency. Many files is a LOT of operations. A lot. ALl running one by one. YOu would be better in case of scenario 2 to SPLIT the 2700 files and run multiple copy operations in parallel. THere is a reason MS did SMB3..
