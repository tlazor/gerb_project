But I want to modify this behavior and keep www.mydomain.com acessing the /var/www/mysite/portal/ folder on background while www.mydomain.com/abc/ still acessing the /var/www/mysite/abc/ folder as before.
Try adding this to your http config (Somewhere in the config, it doesn't work at htaccess or virtualhost level)
This will provide you with a line by line explaination of what it's trying to match against what regex, and what the final decision is.
You could try using the REQUEST_FILENAME conditions the other way around - i.e. say "if REQUEST_FILENAME exists (and is a file/directory/symlink), don't rewrite it" - something like
That Rewrite rule means "let the request go through untouched", and the [L] flag should stop rewrite processing without hitting the portal rewrites below.
All requests keep goin to www.mydomain.com/portal/ when I use this .htaccess (with or without the commented lines)
Other than that, I'd suggest using RewriteLog and RewriteLogLevel (at least level 3) to get more information about why the conditions aren't matching correctly.
Today's my server is redirecting all requests of www.mydomain.com to www.mydomain.com/portal and that's ok...
Remove these lines afterwards, otherwise one day you'll discover you don't have nearly as much disk space as you thought you should...
