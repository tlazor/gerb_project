Have a look at Unity's shader utility code, which includes macros to help you access the lighting information from your shaders. You'll should find these in the Unity install tree (C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\CGIncludes on my Windows machine, /Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/CGIncludes on my Mac). The file that's relevant to your goal is AutoLight.cginc.
You'd need to include AutoLight.cginc in your shader and then use the macros in there to do the work. Looks like you'll want to:
As Netherwire implied in reply to my previous answer, the real question seems to be "How can I make an object respond to only one of several light sources in my scene?"
In this case, you would need to assign the wall object to its own layer, then edit each non-spot light source so that the light's Culling Mask does not include the wall object's layer.
(Note 2: I haven't used spotlights in Unity, so it's fairly likely that you'll have to debug my approach a little.)
What you want to do is definitely possible, since Unity does it in the built-in shaders, and there's nothing in those that you can't duplicate. I can't say whether doing it yourself result in a faster shader than what Unity would generate from a surface shader.
