In order to workaround this the fourth entry has a provision for an Extended partition entry which can have sequential pointers to other Extended partitions. 
A primary partition is a low level concept - it's to do with the initial booting process of the machine, and is based on a well defined set of specifications. It's thus really quite hard to change the number of primary partitions, because a lot of disk and motherboard manufacturers would have to agree to implement a new standard. 
More fundamentally - most operating systems work with more disk abstraction - logical volume managers - which means that actual on-disk topology is largely irrelevant. (And indeed, it's often not desirable to segment your pool of storage)
(This is the same reason why MBR formatted disks have trouble with 2TB+ disks. 512 byte size clusters, and 32bit fields containing cluster-counts for partition size = 2TB maximum disk size. A 4KB cluster size punts the problem down the road a ways.)
Yes, that's exactly it. The partition table at the front of an MBR disk (as opposed to a GPT style disk) has a very strict data-structure that dates from the 1980's when space was a precious, precious thing. The design decision way back then was to only allow four partitions, but allow one of them to be an 'extended' partition that was a pointer to another spot on the disk that could contain a lot more 'logical' partitions.
Practically speaking though, this is a moot point - it's of relevance at 'boot time' for getting your OS started in the first place, but that's about it. Extended partitions exist, which allow more partitions on your disk. You couldn't boot off them though.
