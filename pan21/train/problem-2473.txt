From there, still keeping costs in mind, I would look at BackTrack Linux.  This can be run from a bootable CD, installed to a USB stick, run in as a virtual machine (VMs can only use a USB wireless adapter for most tools) or installed directly.  It contains a number of tools that can be used to discover various aspects of the wireless around you.  The site has links to tutorials/howtos to use many of the tools and your search engine of choice will also be very useful.  While you can install  most of these tools on any version of *nix, it is nice to have them already pre-installed and ready to go.
Since you said in your comments that you are looking more for tools than fixes, here is my short list of tools when your budget is very limited/non-existent (assuming since you are a student and volunteer).
I would also suggest installing a copy of Wireshark.  This is the best free packet capture software you can get (I personally don't know any network professionals without this installed on at least one of their computers - even if they have better paid solution as well).  I do know that with Windows, you need to spend money on a driver that allows you to put your wireless adapter in monitor mode (not just promiscuous mode), such as AirPcap.  On OSX, I am not sure if you can do so natively.
For seeing what is around you in the air as far as 802.11/wifi, one of the better tools is inSSIDer.  Unfortunately, the OSX version does have a small price tag associated to it.
The OSX wireless diagnostics (already referenced by grgarside) is probably one of the best tools for your situation that is part of any mainstream OS.
