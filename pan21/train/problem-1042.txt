In the short, it would allow you to have entity for each item type and attach components on entity depending on what properties such items has. You can combine those components freely. It allows you to extend it easily later when you need something else for that item to do. Than you have system for shopping, system for fighting, system for reviving and so on. Each system is interested only in limited set of components on entities and is working with those.
I would post links for that framework, but my reputation is rather low, so just google Ash Framework
I am not sure how far in development you are, if just beginning, it's really good idea go this way. Otherwise just learn and do it for the next game.
I would recommend you to look into Entity Component System architecture. This is exactly use case where it will shine. There is nice article here and very good implementation by Richard Lord called Ash Framework. It's mainly written for ActionScript (Flash), but there are already ports to other languages, Javascript included.
