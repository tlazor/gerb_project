If your video happens to be in mp4 format then for example MP4Box can be used to demux (extract) the different types of streams (video, audio, subtitles) from it.
This works only if subtitles are not actually "burned" on the video image (easy test - can you turn them off in your player? If yes then all should be well).
On the other hand if your subtitles (or anyone else's who happens to read your question from now on for that matter =) are hardcoded i.e., embedded in your video file, which is often the case with AVI files for instance. It's also possible to extract them but you will need to proceed with OCR (Optical Character Recognition). SubRip for instance, there are others. The extraction that way takes much more time, because of the numerous computations involved by OCR (several filters must be applied to extract any "useful information", timecodes, ... then it's simple OCR as each frame may be processed as a picture) and the results depend of your video (are the subtitles outlined ? how readable/legible is the font used to display them ? are they displayed directly on the video or is there some stationary background ? ...)
