This will accept the input preserving your Japanese keyboard layout, but will keep the defaults (for Office and other software) and menus at English. 
What you can do is the following "hack". AFAIK, there is no limitation as to which keyboard can be added to which language. So add one of your desired keyboard layouts (i.e. Japanese) as a new keyboard layout to the English language. You should then be able to uninstall the original English keyboard layout. So you basically tell Windows that your Japanese keyboard belongs to the English language. The other layout (Bulgarian) can stay like it is. 
As long as you really don't need the English keyboard layout, this solution should be an acceptable workaround. But of course it would be much nicer if Windows 8 would allow separate handling of languages and keyboard layouts, as it used to be up to Windows 7...
On the "keyboards and language" menu go to "Change keyboards" and ask to add a new one in the "Add..." button. Then, go to the language you need (English in your case, because you want English to be the default language) and click on the "+" for "Keyboard", after that select the "Show More..." checkbox and all other languages will be shown. Here you can select your Japanese keyboard layout. 
I fear that is not possible. I had a similar problem with a laptop with a US keyboard layout, which I wanted to use in German language. So i switched the system language to German, but kept using the US English keyboard layout. However, the German keyboard layout kept showing up in the language bar and could not be removed in the language settings. It seems that you have to have at least one keyboard layout per installed language.
