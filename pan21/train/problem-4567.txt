VRF is one of famous solutions to make and provide an isolated network to clients(or users). But it lives on provider's half and not user's half in cloud world. VPC is an abstracted concept of isolated network and the only thing users need to care. I mean, the terms MPLS and VRF are part of the layer 2 and 3 and which are not used in Google Cloud Platform since those are managed by Google ISP.
However, GCP uses other concepts/components in order to get a isolation network. Assuming that you want to extend your on-prem network which has VRFs to GCP, from a very high level you can create multiple VPC networks in GCP (each VPC network can be thought of as a VRF on GCP side) and then use Cloud Router - VLAN attachment per VPC network to connect to on-prem side which advertises subnets and propagates learned routes in the region where the router is configured or throughout the entire VPC network.
I am currently looking at GCP to use as an addition within our existing infrastructure. I am looking at trying to set up a vrf so I can keep this traffic isolated from my current setup, I can't find any documentation regarding vrfs or MPLS at all and was wondering if anyone has achieved this or gone down this path previously and can point me to any documentation or the reasons why this is not possible? 
Additionally, please note that the VPC network can be connected to on-prem using a VPN connection. So, talking about a VPC network, those are "isolated" to customers by virtue of being in different projects.  One customer's VMs in their VPC network cannot connect to another customer's VMs in a different VPC network, unless the two VPC networks are connected using something like VPC peering (which requires Network Admin authorization for each VPC network) or by creating VPN tunnels to connect the two VPC networks.
