A floating island?  You don't really need 3D noise for that, just get two layers of 2D noise, then overlay them.  One layer is the "ground" layer, then the next layer is the "floating islands" layer, and you could even go for a 3rd layer that you consider the "clouds" layer.  There really should be no correlation between the ground layer and the "floating islands" layer.
Like @bobobob suggest just layer two 2 dimensional perlin noise (or similar functions) together, here is an example, (this is assumes you are using voxels, but you can easily adapt it to pretty much any thing with height data) here is the pesudo code:
So as the top and bottom half are pretty much similar, just inverted and really huge, make the frequency really low but the amplitude really high.
3D perlin noise is basically for animations.  Say you had a pool of molten lava that you generated with 2D perlin noise, and you want it to appear flowing.  Well you'd use 3D perlin noise for that, and create an animation by selecting "sheets" from the cube of 3D perlin noise.  The beauty of it is the noise would appear continuous throughout the animation, because the Perlin noise would be smooth in the 3 dimensions.
Sounds like you are in over your head. You would probably want to split the two tasks of generating and positioning islands. Try first generating a bunch of islands, and then placing them randomly, if an island is placed so that it collides with an already placed island (or is just too close) reposition it, check again etc.
