"Stretch Backports" is a more interesting repository though; consisting of fairly up to date packages "backported" to Stretch. If version 17.3.9 was satisfactory you could try installing from the backports repo.
You will be able to see that all the mesa packages Ej. "libgles2-mesa-dev" have a 18.1 version, however, if I execute the command "sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev" it says that I'm already on the latest version (13.0.6), I thought this was because I was using a RPi3 with raspbian Jessie, but like an hour ago, I did a fresh install with the last raspbian image (debian 9 strecth), and when I execute the command to install the mesa packages it still points to the 13.0.6 version, so why that version 18.1 exist?, what distro can access it?
You can use packages.debian.org to check this in a really easy way. I usually just search in Google for the package name and look for the result from the Debian Packages site.
So, in this case, you have the latest version from the Stretch repository. If you look in the top right of that page you can also see [stretch-backports] and [buster]. Buster is what will become Debian 10, and is currently in testing, but that is where 18.1.4 is used. Generally it is a very bad idea to start taking packages from testing and installing them in your stable distribution (it usually ends up breaking your system horribly).
