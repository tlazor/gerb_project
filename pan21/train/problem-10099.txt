For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer. If this setting is enabled, only Administrators can install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer. If this setting is disabled, any user can install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.
One caveat to that is if you're using a Central Store for your GPOs. This will just display the same GPOs you have available on your server. If this is the case, remove the Central Store or update it with ADMX files from your Windows 7 computer. If you upgrade it, you may have trouble continuing to manage GPOs from the servers.

Does 2008 not have Point and print restrictions under Computer Configuration?  Setting this to disabled should allow a Windows 7 client to pull and install a print driver from a 2008 print server.  If you go to the server environment, I.E.: a terminal server, you have to add one more setting to allow users to add printers.  Again toggle Point and Print to disabled but also set Computer Configuration | Policies | Windows Settings | Security Settings | Local Policies | Security Options
Install RSAT on a Windows 7 computer. Once RSAT is installed, you can enable the Group Policy Management Console feature and edit the GPO from the Windows 7 computer. This will enable you to edit the policy at the Computer Configuration level, which is what Windows 7 requires in order to disable Point and Print.
