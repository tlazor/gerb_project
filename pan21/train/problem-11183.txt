Make sure there are no additional DNS servers in the advanced section of TCP/IP settings. You can see it the button at the bottom right corner of John T's Picture. 
One option is to set a public internet dns server instead of an internal dns server for your static dns entry.  Options include Google (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4), OpenDNS, and many others.  The downside here is that you won't be able to use dns to resolve names on the local networks, only the public internet.
Failing that, I'd completely reset the network adapter by removing it from the Device Manager, and then letting it autodetect/reinstall on the next reboot.
Mostly, though, you just shouldn't set static IPs on portable devices.  Static IPs are for devices that are more, well, static... things like printers and servers.  If you want a consistent IP on your internal network, the better way to accomplish that is to use a dhcp reservation.
You are likely viewing cached pages on other networks which is why it appears to work for a few seconds. If you have internal DNS servers specified, then you migrate to another network with DNS servers that are addressed differently, you will not be able to access your previous DNS servers unless they are external to the LAN.
EDIT: Just realized you were using XP.  Don't know if XP has a "Safe Mode with Networking" option in its F8 menu...
Perhaps you have an antivirus program or malware that is changing those settings behind your back.  Check services.msc for anything that might be managing your network or trying to protect you.  Try temporarily disabling any "Network" protection on your antivirus, or seeing if you can go into Safe Mode with Networking and not experience your issue.
