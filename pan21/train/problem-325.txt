I would start by trying to extract methods from your code.  My general rule of thumb is that a method should be small enough to fit on the screen without having to scroll up or down.
I also find you are using too many comments (from what I can read of them).  For example, when I see a method refreshList(), I know that is probably going to refresh a list.  a comment like // refresh listview met nieuwe tijd en spoelingen is unnecessary.  One thing though, you might want to rename refreshList() to something which explains it a bit better, i.e. RefreshListViewWithUpdatedData()
I also noticed you are not following C# standards.  In C# method names start with a capital: RefreshList() (Pascal Case), local variable names start with a low case letter (Camel).  I'd suggest you read Microsoft's Page on casing.
I also find you have WAY to many nested if statements.  Things get really confusing when you start trying to figure out the code path.  Using the same method extraction I mentioned above, you should be able to totally eliminate the nested ifs by pulling them out.
