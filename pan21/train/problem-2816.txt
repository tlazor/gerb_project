This would prevent the computer from communicating with any hosts outside the local subnet, but still allow all communication within your local network. You can use organizational units in Active Directory so that the group policy only applies to the computers you specify.
Is there any objection to using a web filtering appliance like a Barracuda Web Filter? It's AD-aware and would probably be a more robust solution.
This will only work with 7 and 2008 unfortunately, but firewall rules via GPO?  Why not block outbound traffic on known ports (80, 443) to anything not in the local subnets for AD (if you need that, that is) and do so through Group Policy.  Just occurred to me.  Not sure if it is that practical because
If you do want to proceed, here is how to enable forwarders (turn them off, of course), and here is how to manage root hints (remove these entirely).
So, you can set up the AD DNS servers internally to not forward requests to the root DNS servers, which will give you much the same effect; you'll have to put the AD DNS servers in the clients' DNS config, but DNS resolution will be able to go no further. However, this is a very weak way of blocking internet access, as your users would be able to memorize a DNS server address (such as Google's, 8.8.8.8), and then use nslookup to resolve DNS queries by hand.
