Unless you're using Windows NT 4, I'd recommend using Windows PowerShell - it's powerfull and pretty easy to use (at least compared to VBScript, KiXtart etc.)
The secretary at my work uses a spreadsheet that lists names, phone numbers, and locations of employees to look up info if someone asks. All this info is located in AD, but the problem is that we are a rapidly growing company, and people change locations, job titles, and sometimes phone numbers quite often, so her spreadsheet is frequently out of date. I'm a low level tech, but my boss suggested to me that I should try and put together a batch script of some sort that she can run from her computer that goes into AD, pulls this info into a csv, and then throws that into an excel document. 
I'm not too familiar with scripting (did a bit of python in school, but not a huge amount), so I guess I'm just looking for some pointers in the right direction. I pretty much get exactly what the script needs to do, I'm just not sure what commands are out there to interact with AD and pull info from it. Is it even possible to do this with a batch script? And would she need certain access into AD to run it from her computer?
To interact with and retrieve data from Active Directory with PowerShell, you life will be a lot easier using the Active Directory Module for PowerShell.
These attributes are all public, meaning that she can execute the script on her own, she won't need an admin to run it for her
