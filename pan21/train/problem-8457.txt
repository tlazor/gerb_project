On the other hand, the 'Send to' menu sends the file's path to a program, script or shortcut in the user's 'Send to' folder. The file itself is then under the control of the program. It can be opened, attached to an email, or used in any way which the program may need. The file itself is usually not changed or moved (although there are some 'Send to' scripts which do affect the file).
In the case of 'Send to (folder name)' entries, the script takes the path of the selected file and copies it to the location specified. This takes most of the work out of cut/copy and paste, as the user does not have to browse between folders.
Cut/copy and paste are used to move files around the drive; the 'Send to' menu is generally used to give the path to a file to an application, so that it can be used in some way.
As long as a file is not protected by Windows (i.e. a system file), the cut/copy/paste commands can be used to move or replicate it to any other folder on the drive. There is no evaluation of the contents of the file, or how its modification could affect any programs which rely on it to execute.
