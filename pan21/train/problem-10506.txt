Most user date should end up in the appropriate \Documents and Settings\ folder (\Users\ and \ProgramData on Vista).  I usually do a quick search for any folders containing the user's login name as well.
The thing that I overlook very easily is saved passwords.  Though an unsafe practice, lots of people use the save password feature in Firefox.  It's always a good idea to remind the user to try to remember all of their passwords before you blow away their machine.  There is also the slightly dangerous strategy of using a backup system like Xmarks(formerly Foxmarks). 
Finally, I always check in the root of drives - lots of users sometimes create extra folders or store files in C:\, just because it's fairly easily accessible from My Computer. Once I found a user who stored a 10GB+ music library entirely in the root of the C drive, and would have been very unhappy to have lost while getting a new system.
You should also look for other folders the user might be using - if an application creates user profiles in its installation directory rather than in the user's home directory, get that as well.
You should always check all user home directories ("Documents and Settings" on XP; "Users" and "ProgramData" on Vista). Make sure you don't leave out hidden folders like Local Settings or Application Data - many a user has gotten angry with me because I forgot to grab their IE bookmarks when migrating or recovering data.
