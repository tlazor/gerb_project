Your other alternative would be using a different browswer it's always better to have 2-3 different browser to use anyways just incase if one get hijacked you don't want to be limited with one if one stops working you have other options. Best ones to get is google chrome and firefox.
We ran into this issue with a web application - it turns out that we were not properly setting the MIME types of the content files we were delivering (specifically, the external .css files).  I'm not sure about IE8, but IE9 would not actually apply the css files if the .css file MIME type was not text/css.
Check if you have disabled showing images (Internet options -> Advanced -> Multimedia -> Show Pictures).
Use Fiddler, IE9's Network tab, Firefox's Net tab, or any other HTTP request viewer to see the actual request and response for your .css and image files.  This will let you check the MIME type, see if they're coming back with normal HTTP status codes (200 is normal, 304 is not altered since last requested - both are common here), and see how long and in what order the files are requested.  If it isn't the MIME type, you may be able to figure out what is the issue.
Best thing to do is reset your internet explorer there's an option in the tools/internet options/advanced/restore advance settings and click the other one as well reset.
You can also explore the HTML source or save it in a file and open it another browser to eliminate other factors.
EDIT: You mentioned it worked for you intermittently - I'd still recommend this method to ensure files are being downloaded properly, it could be a firewall or something else client side.
