I've set up a server with Nginx and PHP5-FPM, and things are running fine. However, as I add more and more sites to the server I see that the memory usage steadily increases, and I've come to the conclusion that PHP5-FPM is to "blame". 
However, I can't really find too much details on this. What I'm most curious about is how the variables pm.max_children and pm.max_requests affect the ondemand mode (if at all). I assume that the variables pm.start_servers, pm.min_spare_servers, pm.max_spare_servers not apply to the ondemand mode.
What I currently do is that I set up a separate PHP5-FPM pool for each site, and configure that pool according to expected traffic. However, with enough sites, I will in the end have a server which just sists on a rather large number of PHP5-FPM "children" which are just waiting for work.
I just found out about the ondemand PHP5-FPM mode, which allows me to configure PHP5-FPM in a way so that child processes are forked only when actually needed, and then kept alive for a given duration to process.
