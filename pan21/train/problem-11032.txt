This splits the ear-phone connections and the microphone connections into 2 separate plugs.  The only down-side is that you won't be able to get any use out of the button.  (no way to detect button-press from a laptop)
First, no.  There won't be any harm in plugging those headphones into your laptop.  Voltage tolerances are identical between the iphone and PCs.  What is not always identical is the type of plug.  The QC20 has a 4-conductor 3.5mm plug which includes ground, left, right and microphone channels.  Typical 3.5mm headphones for music & such only have 3-conductors (left, right and ground)  There should not be any problems using this, as the conductor used for the mic sits in what would normally be ground.  To be safe, or to gain full-functionality, I would  suggest investing in something like this:
I just purchased a pair of Bose QC20. Advertised as noise-canceling headphones, they are actually earbuds. I usually use them with my iPhone. My question is: is it harmful to the earbuds if I use them on a Mac or PC? Is it possible that the difference in voltage, output (not sure what that's called) between an iPhone and a laptop will harm the earbuds? Thanks in advance.
