Note: the first backup with rsync will be slow because all files are copied. Subsequently only the changed files are copied, and they can be compressed during the copy.
Do you need history (multiple backups) or just a plain copy of your data to some other disk? Backing up 100GB of 10KB files would take ages  if you don't use a block level backup. Think about making block level snapshots or some other block level based solution, if you really need a fast solution.
Take a look at rsnapshot, it's just a script that you can use as front for rsync. It will only backup stuff that has changed and rotate your backups. 
rsync can be somewhat painful if you have a very large number of files - especially if your rsync version is lower than 3. On the other hand: if you use tar, you would generate a very big resulting tar-file (unless the data may be compressed a lot). Personally, I would look at rdiff-backup, but make sure that you test your restore situation: rdiff-backup can be very memory demanding when restoring.
Tar is an archive utility. You could conceivably create a tar file for the entire 100GB+, but you don't want to transfer it all, each time.
