The standard procedure for obtaining the Orange Pi's IP seems to be to log in to the admin Interface of the router, and to pull it out from there--but I am unable to do that because I am using my school's networks--and our IT Department has never had to perform anything like this, so the project has been put on hold. They told me to try "Angry IP Scanner" but I could not find my device through that program--a user also told me to try nmap but again, no luck with that either.
A friend said it is possible to link the PC to the Orange Pi via Eternet cable and connect to it like that... I can't seem to find any information for doing so, does anyone know if this is even possible? 
Does anyone know of any other method to obtain the device IP? One in which I do not have to login to the router's admin interface.
I have an Orange Pi Zero, which I have flashed Raspbian on. It does not have HDMI, so I need to connect to it via Putty (or a similar program). The problem is that I cannot obtain the device's IP address, which seems to be a requirement in order for me to connect to it through programs like Putty.
