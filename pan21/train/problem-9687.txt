courier is not actually the issue here, it sounds like your apache and php is setup in DSO (mod_php) mode which means apache and php run as the nobody user this means that by default if not set emails sent via php/the webserver will appear to come from nobody@server as thats the user that created the original email, there are really only 2 solutions here
I am helping out with some Linux admin work. The server hosts several sites. The admin interface used is WHM.
make sure each site that sends emails is correctly configured to also send the reply-to header and set the from header during mail send, this way bounce messages will go to the correct place
When an email from one of the hosted sites bounces, the site is not notified - it just goes to nobody@server.
use a different php mode like suphp or fcgid which will run the processes as each user and will then bounce back into there cpanel account - this will still need them to forward it from there cpanel default account to there own account but at least its going to the user.
