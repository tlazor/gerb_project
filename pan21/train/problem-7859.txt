It depends on the vendor. Cisco supports Cisco, NetApp, EMC, StorageWorks, IBM and HP passive twinax SFP+ transceivers. If you use a non-certified transceiver the switch will log a warning but still try to bring the port up.  This is documented here.
That said -- The whole point of SFP / SFP+ / XFP / etc is to prevent vendor lock-in of optics and to allow multi-sourcing of optics for large customers (IE so that AT&T isn't left without a source of transceivers if there is an earthquake in japan that breaks 2 large factories).  So the SFP+ is designed to inter-operate, and the CX4 cables are also an IEEE standard, so if it is labeled as such, it should inter-operate.
Just ran into this today. Specific to 10G TwinAx - no, EMC does not support passive twinax cables with the VNX. Cisco catalyst 3560/3750 do not support active TwinAx cables. Never the twain shall meet. Cisco Nexus 5000/7000 do support active TwinAx, so this is the way to go.
I imagine that this falls into the category of "It'll work but you may have a hard time getting support unless you get both vendors to sign off on the configuration."
HP used to only work with HP cables. Now it is a mixed bag. We have some HP servers where we had to purchase HP cables to connect them to a Nexxus 5000. We have HP c7000 chassis with virtual connect modules that work similar to the Cisco. They are certified to work with certain vendors but it will work with others while issuing a warning.
How compatible are twinax SFP+ cables when used with different hardware vendors' equipment? E.g. are Cisco SFP+ cables fine between an Arista switch and a Solarflare card? How about an Amphenol cable with Cisco switches and Myricom cards? If in doubt, does it make sense to go with the NIC manufacturer or the switch manufacturer? I've not been able to find any good information either way.
