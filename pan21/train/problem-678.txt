Maybe, since in fact the way this works is mount called by an init service.  On current versions of Raspbian, init is systemd, and looking at man systemd-mount (which pertains to services with a .mount suffix) implies that it might indeed be hardcoded.  However, if you really wanted to, you probably could find a way to disable that and create your own service that plays an appropriate role.  Since there are much simpler ways to accomplish the same thing (e.g., symlink /etc/fstab) I doubt anyone has done so.
Earlier versions of Raspbian using SysV init presumably used a script which you could edit.  The problem with this is your changes would not likely be protected from system updates.  A better approach would be, as with systemd, to tweak init's service set and supplant your own.
In both cases, doing so would require a bit of diligence and study since getting the root filesystem mounted is usually a critical element of the boot process and must be properly completed before most other things can happen.
