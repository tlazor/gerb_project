Overall it has been working fairly well, although I'd like to hear some suggestions from gurus who have been working with these sort of circumstances for longer than I have. I'm sure those working in the web hosting business have had their fair share of dealing with these situations. So I'm wondering what the best practices are to approaching these sorts of problems in a corporate environment?
I think it depends on the budget you have for it, what your uptime terms of conditions are and how you or your customers are exposed to this kind of risk.
Currently I have been using (D)DoS-Deflate to manage such situations on numerous remote servers, along with Apache JMeter for load testing. 
Proxy-based DDoS protection could be an option. In most cases it is not a cheap option, but I think it's the most effective. I would ask my hosting provider for a solution. RackSpace, for example, provides this multi-tier mitigation tool. I'm sure all large hosters have similar solutions.  
Hardware-assisted load-balancers such as Foundry ServerIron's and Cisco ACEs are great for dealing with huge numbers of the main types of DOS/DDOS attacks but aren't so flexible as software solutions which can 'learn' newer techniques quicker.
