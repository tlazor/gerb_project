Best of all, a HAT which is the perfect size and exact match to the Pi Zero provides the best possible form factor. Nothing that sticks out like a sore thumb. Nothing that makes the final package more bulky than it needs to be.
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are essential for most projects and Pi Zero is just too small to have a bunch of wires and gizmos connected to it.
And I am impressed not just by this project, but by other Kickstarter projects RedBear has launched.
The best option is HubPiWi - an add on board for Raspberry Pi Zero with 3 USB Ports and an integrated Wifi. The board has a PCB Antenna and does not require and Cable or Connector. 
There are two versions of it - one for newer Pi Zero 1.3 ( with  Camera Connector) and one for earlier versions. The details can be checked at 
I'm looking for a small and neat solution to give the Pi Zero Wi-Fi connectivity. Something along the lines of a Micro-B USB dongle would be nice, but I'm not sure they exist. I'm currently using an OTG adapter plus standard type A dongle and the amount of superfluous wire and plastic involved is ridiculous.
Just get an IoT HAT for Raspberry Pi from RedBear and for only $9, you get WiFi as well as Blue Tooth. IoT HAT for Raspberry Pi
