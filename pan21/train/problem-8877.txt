And comment out the line with root on it by placing a # at the start.  Save the file, and reloading the server is not even necessary.
BTW, if you don't know the answer, please don't bother lecturing me about how I shouldn't allow root logins.  I know what I'm doing, and I accept full responsibility for any ruptures in the space-time continuum that may result.
For those (like me) using VSFTPD on Ubuntu server in mid-2013, it appears that root is allowed to login via SFTP by default, no special changes necessary.
Vsftpd can use pam for authentication, so I suggest you check /etc/pam.d/vsftpd. You will probably find it is pam that has been configured to prevent root from logging in. 
In newer versions, you may need to change pam_service_name=vsftpd to pam_service_name=ftp near the end of your /etc/vsftpd.conf file.  Otherwise, you may get a login authentication error for root (or any user) even though permissions are otherwise correct.
I'm on SLES 10.1, and trying to configure vsftpd to allow root logins.  Does anyone know how to do this?
