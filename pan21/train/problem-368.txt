Other low level networking issues like MTU/Jumbo frames issues or high packet loss could also cause the problem. 
The Connection timed out during banner exchange error message may indicate network issues. If you see a socket is established using netstat on both the server and the client, there may be a firewall or packet inspection device that is preventing the SSH connection from being established. We have seen this issue on a system that was behind a protected network and the firewall rules were not configured properly. The firewall was also dropping any connection that tried to initiate an HTTP/1.1 request, which was confirmed using netcat to simulate a web server and connect to it using netcat. When we changed the response to HTTP/1.2 it let the response thru, indicating something in the network layer was inspecting requests and applying filtering rules against them.
If your firewall (e.g. on a jump host) is using knockd simply try to increase Cmd_Timeout: https://linux.die.net/man/1/knockd
