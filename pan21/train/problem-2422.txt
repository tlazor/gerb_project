This query is going against a query only database, so it's not a result of not having analyzed table statistics either.
I installed MySQL Workbench which seems to be a really nice tool, especially considering the fact that it's free. However, this section in the explorer interface for my connection that is completely grayed out:
The EXPLAIN plan is similar enough to not warrant such a massive increase in execution time, and identical in terms of the number of rows returned at each step.
And I followed the instructions in the MySQL Performance Schema Quick Start Guide and verified that this feature is indeed enabled.

The MySQL Workbench Performance requires the connected database to be version 5.6+. Although 5.5 has most of the capability for it, the MySQL team didn't believe it was mature enough to allow it
I have a complex query that is performing in subsecond time on my laptop, while the same query takes 70 seconds on my production server under no load against an identical schema.
