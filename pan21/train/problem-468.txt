I've being using nfdump/nfsen and Scrutinizer from Plixer since quite some time now (more nfdump than scrutinizer lately). Both are fantastic tools but they each have it's own "niche" of users. 
Nfdump/nfsen is opensource/free-as-cerveza but may be too "geeky" for some users. It's filtering/querying capabilities are extremely powerful (think "tcpdump" filtering syntax but for flows plus aggregation and sorting) but in my opinion it lacks some polishing on the graph-generation/reporting side of the equation (in nfsen). What I love about nfdump is that I'm able to throw some "quick & dirty" command line queries and get the information I need in a format that are ready to feed some python scripts of mine.
One last thing. I know first hand that Scrutinizer can consume sFlow data. I know (from what I've read and the configurations options I've seen) that nfdump can consume sFlow data too but I have personally never done it. I've used nfdump only with Netflow v5/v9 data. So my recommendation would be that before committing to nfdump, you should confirm this capability.
On the other side, Scrutinizer (commercial/not-free-as-cerverza) is a fantastic "visual" tool. Great for generating reports and views to share with the not so "geeky" customers I have. It's querying capabilities are great but I have not found a way to via command line extract information from it (mainly because I have not research if Scrutinizer has this capability because this I can accomplish with nfdump).
