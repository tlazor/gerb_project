I agree with  the other posters, so the approach might be to make it less convenient for a visitor to obtain the images. Things I can think of are:
Is there a web service/site like flickr etc which enables me to upload photos to server and then provides a URL which i can share with viewers but they can only view the photos and not download it with a right click from the browser?
I hope that someone has an answer for you that addresses all the various ways that are available to get at images in a browser.  I'm interested to see the other potential answers.
It is impossible to provide the ability as per u. Because there are variuos screen capturing methods and tools too.
You can share the image in view only mode with the help of flash  but i dont know the particular site .
Many people would love this ability, but it is ... dare I say, impossible? to prevent people from getting a copy of your images out of their browser, one way or another.  I can only imagine that porn site operators have been struggling with this since the boom of their business several years ago.
If your viewers can't directly Right-click|Save As, then they can check their browser cache.  If the images are somehow not cached, then there's always Alt+PrtScrn (or just a whole-screen PrtScrn) and paste into image-editor-of-choice.
