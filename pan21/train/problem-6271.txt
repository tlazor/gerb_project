Bad sectors are not transferred during the cloning process. So SMART will not see the bad sectors from the old drive appearing on the new drive.
You do have one problem, however. If the hard drive you're trying to clone has lots of bad sectors on it, then data may have already been lost. So you're probably better off reinstalling anyway, and moving your data over afterward.
I would assume that the hard drive itself (or any checkdisk-style process run on the drive) will map those sectors elsewhere so that the cloning software doesn't try to write data to them, but that has no impact on the actual bad sectors present on the drive, and doesn't change the answer to your question.
The actual bad sectors are a property of the physical material in the drive, and are not copied. In other words, if you have ten bad sectors on hard drive A, and five on B, and you clone A onto B, B still has exactly the same five bad sectors that it did before the cloning process.
One problem you may have is file damage depending on how many unreadable bad sectors you have. You may see some damaged files that have missing data or "holes" in them. There are advanced cloning methods that can identify which files are damaged due to bad sectors.
Copying means reading from the source and writing to the destination.  Bad sectors can not be read, so there is nothing to write to the destination.  Most copy utilities will fill in all zeros for sectors they can not read.
