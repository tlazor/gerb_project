On top of this, you may just want to find a audio card for the PC that has RCA out, or some connector that you can get a converter for RCA so you can plug the PC directly in to the receiver.
Failing that, an adapter to split the headphone style output from the computer into left and right RCA sockets, and a set of long RCA cables would suffice.
You should ask your father if he would consider a purchasing a device like the Squeezebox.  The Squeezebox connects to your stereo and your network and can play internet audio with no computer necessary.
You can get FM transmitters (like people use to play iPods in cars) to send the sound around the house to be received on a normal tuner. Not sure of the range though.
If you're into DIY, you could grab something like this http://beagleboard.org/ and hide it somewhere :)
It doesn't have to look like one though - the ASUS EeeBox 202 will do the job, and looks like a bit of generic hardware, and probably about the same cost as the squezebox (which was insanely overpriced when I saw it). It will also stream video.
I have seen a number of devices that are actual internet radio players that you should be able to hook directly in to the receiver.
