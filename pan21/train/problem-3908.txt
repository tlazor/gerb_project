Basically, there's a series of steps you have to follow to make a copy of an existing VM. This tutorial covers them. However, if you're not interested in the process itself (and why should you?), you can use XP-More to do all the work for you, and create a copies of any VM.
And voila, you have a completely fresh XP mode VM. :) I've been using this for a while and it works perfectly, and with minimum amount of disk space needed.
You don't need to make a copy of the VM, just create a new VM and make its .vhd file a difference vhd file using XP Mode base image as base (on my comp it resides at c:\Program Files\Windows XP Mode\Windows XP Mode base.vhd). 
You can copy the "XP Mode" VM that you downloaded, though I don't know whether that's permitted within the license you clicked through.  (I didn't read it carefully either.)
It sounds like you just want virtual machines.  That's fine, and you can have as many as you like, assuming you have the right software licenses.
An "XP Mode" VM is just a VM that happens to have Windows XP with the software that allows you to make an application from that VM appear directly as a window in Windows 7.  That software can also be installed in other VMs, too.
