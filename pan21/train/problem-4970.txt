Are you going to be deploying the software you develop to Windows 7? If so then you need a test machine (maybe a VM) with Windows 7 running on it. If you're developing software that is going to be deployed to XP or Vista (corporate policy that the users are running whatever version of Windows and won't be upgrading anytime soon) then you don't really have much reason to upgrade. Building and testing on the platforms that you're deploying to is important.
If your customers would be using Windows 7, it may be useful to have that environment as something you can use for testing and thus see what the customer is seeing.  I'm not sure if there would be a platform difference between using IE in Vista versus 7 but there may well be.  The improvements in performance may be worth wanting to do the experiment of seeing if 7 is better than Vista and what are the gotchas.
Are you talking about the beta or the retail version of Windows 7? If beta, the fact that it is free should be enough reason to persuade management.
You should upgrade from Vista.  You can tell your employer that it's worth the upgrade to benefit from the performance and stability improves that have been made to the OS.  You mentioned MSDN, so it sounds like it's going to be a free upgrade.  If so, it's a no-brainier.
