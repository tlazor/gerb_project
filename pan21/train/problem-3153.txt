In order to learn how to do this, it is vital to understand how routing is performed between the component parts of the large Internet and what is BGP routing.
Another way to control traffic is to mark your announcements with special flags – community, that tell the provider’s router where and how to announce your networks.  For instance, “to site A with three prepends, to site B normally”. There is no standard set of community flags, which is why they need to be stipulated with administrators of your ISP. Usually, these flags are indicated in the description of the autonomous system that can be found in the comments field of RIPE database.
There are a couple of methods that allow use of administrative criteria for traffic management. These criteria are called local-pref and prepend. If the amount of traffic, coming from a site must be decreased, one or two prepends must be placed in AS-path. Thus, the AS-path is artificially extended using 1-2 AS, making it look like your network is announced by someone, located 1-2 autonomous system further from us. As a result, part of the routers, which previously considered the path through this uplink the best one, will choose other paths. Thus, it is possible to balance the load of the incoming links.
