Not that going to revision 1 is a problem, I'm just sure I've done it differently before and I'm looking for the best practice.
On a fresh checkout of a new repository, I create and add the three directories - tags, trunk, and branches. I commit those three; the repo is on rev. 1, and I switch to trunk and get to work. Not much to it, really.
You can create all directories at once (resulting in one commit) without even checking out the repo. See this Windows example:
I have executed svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /home/firefli/web/projects/subversion and have myself a blank repo. If I create, say, the trunk directory using svn mkdir file:///home/firefli/web/projects/subversion/trunk it works fine but I go to revision 1.
When we create SVN repo's at work we svnadmin create and then svn import a skeleton folder of the 3 directories and commit that at once pushing it to revision 1 (We have a bash script automate all of this). I don't think there's a better practice than to just have the initial commit?
