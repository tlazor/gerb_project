I've created a new WinXP vitual machine on my win7 using VMware player. The VM is using NAT to share the host's Internet connection and when i put http://192.168.163.2/ in IE on VM, i can easily access the localhost on the win7. 
So your IP Address would be something like 192.168.0.10 as an example, this way you can access it from your Windows 7 Machine.
It's fine to test sites for cross browser compatibility but when i'm going to test my wordpress blog on VM it doesn't load images. I think to solve the problem i need to access wordpress using http://localhost/wordpress NOT http://192.168.174.2/wordpress.
I don't think localhost will work for this - it generally is exactly that - the local machine. For going from your XP VM to your Win7 IIS page use http://(win7machinename)/wordpress or http://(yourWin7IP)/wordpress. Note that there is lots of stuff that can get in the way here. Your Win7 IIS instance is going to treat the connection from the VM just like a connection attempt from any other outside machine so your website settings and firewall settings have to allow that connection.
Check out my post here. It is one solution that I've tried that does work - http://davemcmillan.net/382/snippets/how-to-test-a-wordpress-site-on-a-mobile-or-virtual-machine/
I've added an entry to the Windows hosts file, which is located at C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts, to map the IP address to a (virtual) server name but it doesn't work:
In order to access your Windows XP machine from your Windows 7 you will need to set your network adapter as Bridged once you do that your Windows XP machine is considered another device on your network.
