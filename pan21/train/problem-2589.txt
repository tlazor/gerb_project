This is arguably trivial, but maybe good enough for you: For any $a,b,c$ with $b \le a \le c$ (in particular $a=b=c$), if $\mathcal{F}$ is maximal subject to (i) and (ii), then it satisfies (iii) for free. So if you're okay with the $b \le a \le c$ condition, then you can otherwise pick the parameters however you want, and then greedily build $\mathcal{F}$.
Semi-related note: I'm reminded of the combinatorial designs used in the Nisan-Wigderson generator. There, they want the sets in $\mathcal{F}$ to have only $O(\log(n))$ overlap (so $b = 2a - O(\log(n)$), but, instead of (iii), they only want that $\mathcal{F}$ is large. So if you want a larger range of parameters than $b \le a \le c$, or have some flexibility in the properties required of your objects, then you might try looking at the related literature for more ideas.
The argument is very easy: In light of (i), (ii) can be equivalently restated as requiring $|S_1 \cap S_2| \le a - b/2$. (In general: $|S_1 \triangle S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| - 2|S_1 \cap S_2|$.) Then, when $b \le a \le c$, if (iii) fails for some set, then you can add any size-$a$ subset of it to $\mathcal{F}$ while preserving (i) and (ii).
