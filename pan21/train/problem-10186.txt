One of their devices we use is the AutoView KVM, which gave us 16 ports (with the ability to stack onto other devices and expand). The interconnects between the server and KVM used cat5 cabling, which allowed for us to connect the KVM to a server that was in another rack more easily, as well as having simpler cable management. The AutoView uses small "dongles" at the end of the cat5, allowing you to connect to a variety of devices by using the correct dongle (you can mix different types in a single kvm). It also means that if you have mostly PS/2 servers now, and decide to change to USB servers down the road, you only have to purchase new dongles. 
We have been reasonably happy with various Avocent  KVMs. They offer a wide range of devices with various features at different price points, although it seems like you already have a good idea of what features you need. 
We also have purchased models which allow multiple users to work on the servers at once, which can be nice for smaller shops with fewer machines.
