And as mentioned by other fellow members, central SMTP server is the way to go when 3rd party service is out of question.
My best recommendation is to use 3rd party email delivery system through the application (e.g. SendGrid) - having to configure postfix manually would be pain (possible with puppet/chef/etc but unnecessary pain) especially when all you care about is guaranteed transactional emails from the app.
Is it more common in this case to install postfix on a central server, or to install it on each app server?  I'd imagine the latter would be easier, requiring less networking/security configuration (and I'd use chef or something to deploy it to all machines at once).  Are there disadvantages to this approach?  
You don't want each server sending out its own mail. Relay through a central server - you'll have a single point to refer to for logging, a single point of configuration with regards to relay ACLs, and a single point to install/configure spam detection/prevention if necessary in the future.
I would recommend you installing local MTA on each server, accepting only connections on localhost, not necessarily demanding auth. These servers then rely to central server, properly configured (PTR, dkim, etc...).
My web application has to send emails, and it's hosted on multiple physical servers.  Using a third-party service is not an option, so I'm installing postfix (or maybe sendmail).  
One potential problem that crossed my mind is whether it'd make it more likely for the message to get flagged as spam, but AFAICT I could set up a reverse DNS for each server and alleviate that problem?  Anything else I'm not considering?
