I've used Amavisd with Spamassassin for years... my configuration used to 'work' (though it may never have been "right") now, it appears as if /etc/spamassassin/local.cf configuration is ignored when spamassassin functionality is invoked by amavisd-new
In my experience, the score returned using amavis vs. using spamsassassin directly is never the same and I haven't figured out why yet, so when you are setting $sa_kill_level_deflt you'll need to figure out an appropriate value that may not be the same as required_score.
amavisd-new uses its own config. These config files are located in /etc/amavis/conf.d/. In particular, in 20-debian_defaults, $sa_kill_level_deflt is the "equivalent" to SpamAssassin's required_score (located in /etc/spamassassin/local.cf).
After adding custom rules to local.cf, don't forget to run spamassassin --lint and to restart spamassassin and amavis daemon
I am perplexed because it appears that the configuration I've placed in /etc/spamassassin/local.cf (a new score for a specific rule, for example) is ignored for messages processed by amavisd, but are not ignored when I run spamc, or "spamassassin -D -t" from the amavis account.  When I place equivalent configuration in ~amavis/.spamassassin/user_prefs - it also seems to have no effect on the results of amavisd-new processing.
Postfix, spamassassin and amavisd are all running as services, and mail is delivered with spamassassin scores.  The bayes database is in ~amavis/.spamassassin/bayes_*.
