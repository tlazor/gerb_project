I would go with a Mikrotik 1100x2 and a backend switch for traffic between the servers. You can hardly beat the price / benedit sode of the Mikrotik 1100 series and until you get LARGE it will be more than sufficient for you.
Answering these kind of questions are hard without knowing what kind/how much traffic you're going to get, and how you're going to route it internally. Are you going to NAT for example?
It sounds like the datacenter is doing all the dynamic routing and failover for you, so all you get is a default gateway from them and depending on your configuration/order: one or more external IP's.
Features put aside, it is mostly a question of what you can configure (in time) and what you can get good support for. Support is not just about "4 hours same day replacement" - you would need to be able to talk to qualified engineers in case you encounter trouble with your configuration or hit some obscure bug. 
With only 6 servers I'm tempted to tell you to get a decent Layer2/3 switch (Like a Cisco 2960S) and a good firewall (Cisco ASA might be a bit expensive here, so pfsense might be a great choice).
While HSRP is indeed a cisco-only feature, most routers should offer one or the other way to support redundancy like VRRP or CARP. You would not need the support from the datacenter's side for redundancy - the protocols work transparently from other IP hosts' point of view.
