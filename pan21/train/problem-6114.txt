In practice, most of the time we don't need six boxes; a minimum pool of two or three would give us the redundancy we need. 
Is it important to always have an ec2 instance in each zone of your load balancer? Are there advantages to having more than two or three zones?
Nope you don't need an instance in each region, the load balancer in each AZ will check if there is an instance in its zone and if not it will route traffic to some healthy instance in some other zone.
We set up our application in an EC2 AutoScaling Group serving as the single Target Group of an Application Load Balancer. For our initial deployment, we set both the Launch Template and the Load Balancer to use six Availability zones. Based on the recommendation in paragraph 4 here, we set the AutoScaling Group's minimum size to six so there'd always be at least one box in each Zone. 
Cross-zone load balancing doesn't really apply in this case. It's only used if there are healthy instances in all ELB zones but you still want the ELB to randomly choose an instance to talk to, regardless of its AZ. By default it only talks to instances in its AZ if there are any. If there are none it still talks to any available instance regardless of Cross-zone load balancing.
I can understand that without Cross-Zone Load Balancing it would be important to have a box in each zone, but Application Load Balancers always use Cross-Zone Load Balancing, so it seems like it shouldn't matter.
