I prefer it compared to tripwire because it is simple to install (just copy a file) and does not require administrator skills or root privileges. 
If you are using Linux, incron will watch files in directories you designate or inotifywait can watch files recursively. Any action can be taken when there are changes.
Not sure whether this is a Linux question. If it is, you can use basically any tool that interfaces with the inotify subsystem of the Linux kernel. Such as, for example, iwatch: http://iwatch.sf.net
You want AIDE - an intrusion detection system. It scans the directories you tell it to, to build up a database of md5 hashes. Then you run it regularly, or on-demand to create another DB which it compares to the original. Differences are reported to you. then you can make the new DB into the baseline and repeat.
It is also the only script/IDS I found that works with cheap hosting (Linux/Windows) without SSH access and without cron.
You don't have to check file changes, it'll report on permission updates and other items as well. The report it produces is a text file that can be emailed after a run - google for examples.
