However, ext4 can be changed (while offline) as I described above using a command similar to this: sudo tune2fs /dev/sde5 -U $(uuidgen). If you can't do this to the block device on the SCST side (you'd have to turn off the target to unlock the block device), then perform this operation on an initiator.
The filesystem UUID is the same on both of the block devices you're serving out. That has nothing to do with SCST (as your problem a layer above what SCST cares about), and is the same on both volumes because you copied their filesystems 1:1 using dd.
If you don't want to deal with this in the future, you'll need to re-think your dd approach and consider using something like a file based copy to do whatever it is you're trying to accomplish. However, a block copy and then re-label / re-uuid has the potential to be faster than copying a lot of small files.
It really matters what filesystem type they are formatted as, as you can change the UUID of most filesystems post-creation. BTRFS is an example of a filesystem that does not support this operation due to its advanced features that utilize UUIDs extensively.
