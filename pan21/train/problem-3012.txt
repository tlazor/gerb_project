Your system has hardware that is too new to run Squeeze properly. Add Backports and install the latest X.org and kernel from there - it should let you run Squeeze.
but It just made the screen blank, with a flickering cursor. I'm starting to give in to insanity after 2 days worth of googling, and so decided to write a question here before depression eats me. 
-Is there a way for the Intel and Nvidia cards to work together with X in harmony?(I'm not giving up on it yet)
NVidia's dual-graphics stuff barely works, and won't be usable in Squeeze without some serious tweaks. That said, the Intel driver should work fine. Delete the xorg.conf file, disable the nVidia card in your bios, and reboot. Install and run glxgears if you need to and make sure that you have hardware accelerated rendering. Compiz should start up just fine. Unfortunately, Compiz is a very outdated technology. The original maintainer isn't even maintaining it anymore. Gnome Shell, Kwin, XFWM4, and Enlightenment all provide their own hardware accelerated window managers. I know KWin4 can run separately from KDE, and it performs very well with Intel graphics.
 when I install the Nvidia driver , and try to use it the screen goes blank, sometimes white, sometimes black, with a flickering cursor. 
-Apart from that, how can I determine which driver do I need from Intel? all I got from lspci is it's an intel Corp. device 0166, rev9(whatever that means, search returned nothing)
 After a day of googling I decided to start with a fresh install and use the intel card insted, and just try to make compiz work on that, but the out-of-the-box driver for the intel card isn't enough for compiz, every time I try 
Now I managed to put a minimalistic GUI on it, but I think I can get much much more out of it. The problem starts with there are two graphic cards:
