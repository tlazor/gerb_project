However, if you don't care about the zero being there so long as nobody can see it, I'd recommend using conditional formatting to set the font color to be the same as the background. The cell will still contain the value 0 but it won't be seen on the screen or in a printout.
You may be able to reduce the size of the formula further - what type of values will be in the intermediate cells W42, Z42, AC42, AF42 and AI42, numbers, text, something else? For example, as long as those intermediate cells don't contain numbers or dates you could use this shortened version:
As you've figured out, the formula is returning 0 if the cell it wants to return is blank. There are a few ways to go about changing this depending on what you need. The most common method for "return the value unless it's blank and then be blank" is to wrap the whole thing in an IF statement but that doubles the length.
If you were trying to return a numeric value, you could use the trick below to avoid having the messy formula twice. However, I think you're trying to return names and it doesn't work with strings.
If you are only putting names in columns V,Y,AB,AE,AH and AK then you don't need those cells in the COUNT function (names won't be counted by COUNT function, it only counts numbers), so you can reduce the size of the formula by removing those....and as you are returning text values you can simply concatenate a "null string" to the end of the formula to convert zero to blank if the relevant name cell is blank, so try this version
=IF('Training Schedule'!U42="","",INDEX('Training Schedule'!V42:AK42,COUNT('Training Schedule'!U42:AJ42)*3-2)&"")
If you uncheck the marked option - then the file will automatically stop showing values in which result is 0.
If this file is going to be dedicated for this purpose - changing an option in excel would be helpful - rather than add a formula to hide the available zero.
