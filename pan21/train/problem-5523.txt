I have access to Powershell, "DBATools.io" scripts, SQL Server Agent, and a remote SQL server if it can help. All under SQL2016.
Alternatively, anyone has a super hot way to get Production data down to QA or DEV environments easily and automatically?
I also just discovered today the SQL2016 feature called AUTOMATIC SEEDING. I tried it, and it allows me to bypass the complicated "Add database to AG" steps. 
Refresh scripts to downstream environments are specific to company environment esp. the post restore process like desensitizing or masking data, etc. So, I would say, invest some engineering time and make the process repeatable that will save you a lot of time in future.
Following Kin's advice, here is the (semi)final result. If some people would add to it to make it even more modular/parametrizable/robust, I am sure it can get useful.
You can create linked server and use Execute At LinkedServer. This is what I am doing in my current scripts when I have to refresh AG env in Dev / QA from PROD.
I want to create a script/job that will run weekly to backup my PROD database, and restore it to my QA server, then run a custom maintenance script against it to cleanup and prepare the data to be analysed.
