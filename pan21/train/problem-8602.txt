The two biggest things, read the cert guides. Those things have some valuable info if you are just starting out. Secondly, practice...practice and more practice. In my opinion hands on practice is one of the best ways to become proficient with the material along with using the concepts in a functioning environment. CCNA was a tough go, but with effort most people of average intelligence can learn and master the material. The Cisco cert courses have been some of the most valuable sources of info around, I definitely feel like without them I would have never made the jump to admin level and ultimately engineer level positions.
Packet tracer and GNS3 for simulation is a great idea to start....9tut along with the Cisco forums can also be a good source of helpful info if you are having issues grasping a concept. 
If you can afford to do it I highly recommend building a home lab setup using a pre-fab home lab which you can purchase off of Ebay or the like. Usually you get a few 2821 routers and a couple of 3560 switches to go along with them, including all of the necessary add on cards. This will give you ability to run IOS 15 and get some hands on practice. The going rate is usually about 299 but sometimes you can find one on CL.com etc for less if someone is selling theirs on the cheap.
