Here's the problem: The RAs from R2 are overriding the default route on all the hosts on the original subnet (so that they no longer have the correct default route, as advertised by R1). R2's default route still correctly points at R1, so everything on the subnet "works", in that external IPv6 nodes are reachable, but all external traffic is now incorrectly getting routed through R2.
If there are other reasons that you want to send router advertisements then explicitly tell receivers that the router is not a default gateway:
However, I offer this advice: Can you start radvd to listen on only one interface, and specify a configuration file?  Also, can you do that a second time, listening only on another interface, and specifying another configuration file?  If so, that may reduce your chances of certain behaviors seeming to leak to another interface.
As my memory serves me, I believe I've worked more with BSD rtadvd than Linux's radvd - same concepts, a bit of a different implementation.
So my question is: how can I prevent the RAs from R2 from setting the default route for hosts on my original subnet (the one with both R1 and R2 connected to it)? I need the RAs from R1 to provide that default route!
I am trying to create a subnet with two IPv6 routers, call them R1 and R2. Originally, my subnet had only R1, connecting it to the Internet via a Hurricane Electric tunnel. R1 was (and still is) running radvd, and all hosts on the subnet are working fine (and still are, so I won't post R1's radvd.conf here). Recently, I added R2 to the subnet, and put another (new) subnet behind it. I have radvd running on R2, with the following radvd.conf file:
