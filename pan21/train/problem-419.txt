That being said, HTTP Basic Auth over an unencrypted connection is crap: Both the username and password are sent in the clear and can be intercepted by any motivated attacker.  Think of it as the Telnet of HTTP authentication protocols.
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html has some more details on all of this (old, but still valid), and you can probably turn up more by googling "HTTP Auth security" and flipping through the results.
In either case, I would suggest using Digest authentication instead of Basic authentication (even over SSL, due to my inherent paranoia).  Again, you're still as vulnerable as your most guessable password, but that's a policy problem for you to solve :)
Any password protection scheme can be bypassed if your users are using lousy passwords.  No technical details can make up for using "password" as your password.
If you're running all of this on a https:// (SSL-secured) server with no way to get to the password-protected bits in pain-old-http:// mode you're better off, as everything is encrypted traveling over the wire.
