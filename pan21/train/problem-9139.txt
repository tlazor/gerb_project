All digital signals are subject to noise. The noise can be from power cables, florescent lights, wireless telephones, and so on. Most protocols such as TCP/IP have various methods like CRC check sums to find errors and either correct them or have that packet of data resent.
To minimize the problems and keep retransmissions to a minimum you can do several things. First use quality cables. CAT 6 is better then CAT5 which is better then simple twisted pair. Keep cables runs as shorts as possible. Longer cables will capture more interference (that is simplified but basically true), avoid power cables. A short section of cable next to a power line won't cause big problems, but don't run both through a long conduit right next to each other. 
I also would imagine that the other cable types you listed would be much more susceptible to interference, since they can't even travel very long distances (USB cables, for instance, are not supposed to be longer than 6 feet).
I have heard (but never seen any hard data) that you should not run Ethernet cables parallel to high voltage power for more that a couple feet.
