Only if the application that created the CD saves a log of its own or writes information to the Windows system logs.  Windows itself does not natively store this information, no.
Lumension or similar product can log what has been copied to USB, external harddrives, CDs and DVDs. But that would be more of an enterprise solution. 
Most likely though there's no history, but give it a try and see if the files show up in that directory or the access date changes.
I don't believe that Windows (any version) saves a history of the files burned to disk.  I goggled around for a few minutes and didn't come up with any proof that it does.  I have a background in computer forensics, and have never heard this mentioned as a technique.  The only way it may record anything is if in the process of burning the files to CD windows considered those files as being accessed and maybe put those in the recent items list [C:\Users(User Name)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent Items], and/or if the accessed/modified date is changed on the file itself.
