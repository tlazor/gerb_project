To overcome this problem you can simply use an external Usb Memory Card Reader (i.e. sd card to usb adapter) instead of built-in card reader. It will expose your sd card as a USB device so that you can mount it easily just like any usb device. They're cheap devices and would be an acceptable solution considering all the hassle in the other way.
Now go to the VM Settings, select Storage, click on Controller:Sata, click on the icon for Add Hard Disk, select your .vdk (sd-card.vmdk in this case)
As kobaltz mentioned. To support the USB 2.0 and 3.0 versions you need to install the Virtual Extension Pack, I installed the 5.2.22 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack, and you can download it from the Virtual Box download page. Once you download the file, you can directly go ahead and install it, the same will be added to your Virtual Box extensions.
You should also add your SD card to the device filters in our Virtual Box, please go to Settings â€“ > USB -> Click on the Add SD card Attached option.
