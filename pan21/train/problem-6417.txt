Then the port on your router facing the port on the ISP router should be 192.168.1.(anything but 1)/24 Gateway 192.168.1.1
I'm assuming you are using a layer 3 switch. If so, you should be able to configure multi SVI's (Switched virtual interface) you will need to create a SVI for each VLAN. You can do this by running the following IOS command:
You need to add interfaces to the gateway/router for the 10.0.100.x, 10.0.200.x. and 10.0.300.x networks. Otherwise you can't route from those networks to a different (in this case a 192.168.x.x) network.
The addressing on the Ubiquity should match addressing for your Vlans IE 10.0.100.1, 10.0.200.1, 10.0.300.1 and should match the VLAN ID for each one of the corresponding VLANs.

If you are using a L2 switch you will need to enable a trunk port between the L2 switch and your router. You will then need to create a virtual interface on the router for each Vlan, each interface must have an ip address on the same subnet. 
Before we start you need to ensure you can ping your Ubiquity router's LAN interface, I am assuming it is 192.168.1.1. You will need to ensure the interface from your switch to your router is in VLAN 1 and then add an IP address to your Vlan 1 interface by entering the following command. The IP address must be in the same subnet (192.168.1.X/24)
Based on the fact they are getting IP addressing already means that you have setup the trunk properly on the cisco.
