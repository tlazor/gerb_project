(I'm using windows-7 and the hard drives are western digital with whatever formatting they came with from the factory)
Open the Disk Management app by right-clicking My Computer > Manage > select Disk Management from the left menu.  Plug in your USB drives, and you can manually assign drive letters to each drive through the Disk Management system.  I'd suggest using letters that are farther down the alphabet, that way it's clear that no other device could steal that drive letter.  For example, I always fill my drives in from Z moving backwards through the alphabet.
i'm thinking of setting up two different back-ups one through windows and one with the software that came with the drive (because windows gives me a system image but isn't very user-friendly for my files)
fyi, if the drives happen to be assigned the same signature ID (as happened with our two identical WD mypassport drives), then the above solution won't work--if you change one of them to 'drive Z', then unplug it and plug in the 2nd one, it will also be assigned 'drive Z'--windows thinks it's the same drive.  if both plugged in at the same time, then still only one is given a drive letter.  as far as i can tell, you need to change the signature ID for one of the drives.. nicely explained here: http://www.howtohaven.com/system/change-disk-signature.shtml
