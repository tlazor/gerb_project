There are a couple 3rd party programs that do similar things.. or just get a stand that will put your MBP at an angle so the cat doesn't jump on it..
I'm looking for some utility or hack to disable completely the internal keyboard and to re-enable it either using the mouse or using some key combination.
My cat has a nasty habit of jumping over my MBP and causing keystrokes that mess up things (anywhere from stopping a playing video to deleting a file).
Try the free software CatNip, which claims to detect cat-like typing and locks the keyboard in response.
Unfortunately, this means you have to be not using your computer at that point. Other than using an external monitor and so on and closing the lid, I don't know of any built in way of disabling the keyboard.
You could put a password on your screen saver ("Require password [time] seconds after sleep or screen saver begins" in the "General" tab of the "Security" section of System Preferences, probably best to add a hot corner for quick activation). This will require you to enter your password whenever you return to your computer - unless your cat knows it, you'll be protected from any accidental input.
