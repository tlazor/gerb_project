This is almost certainly single host with many IP addresses routed to it and simple script to make it appear like it's traversing many hosts.
So yes, for intermittent hosts which are probably routers, one can set these to pretty much random names and these would turn up in the X.Y.Z.W.IN-ADDR.ARPA queries.
The downside is that you can't really access that host throught the DNS name reported - but then, if they are part of the core infra, this should not be a major problem anyway.
Obviously the person does not control A record for those hosts and couldn't have A resolve for them.
How are the host names in this trace route able to use random top level domains? I didn't know there was an 'Empire' or 'victory' top level domain.
This RFC explains the DNS system http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt. And most importantly, the section "3.5. IN-ADDR.ARPA domain" explains how these names are set for reverse lookup of the IP addresses.
The PTR record doesn't have to be a valid FQDN. (for internal / non-internet DNS servers, this is not uncommon.)
Like Ricky+Laazik say no limits what PTR can point to, like no limits where A can point to, just you won't be able to have it PTR -> A -> PTR unless you control both.
