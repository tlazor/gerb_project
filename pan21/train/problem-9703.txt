Not only Windows RT can't connect to an ad-hoc hot-spot, but it seems even Windows 8 Pro can't do it (and provide Internet access). I have Joikuspot on a Nokia Symbian phone. This creates an ad-hoc hotspot, which my household's Win7 PCs can connect to with no problem. My Win8 PC can see the hotspot and connect to it, but can't access the Internet. It claims that the connectivity is "limited" and it can't gain an IP address.
You surely CAN connect Surface Pro to ad-hoc network. The only problem is that Surface does not detect ad-hoc networks automatically. Instruction to manually connect to network is quite simple:
In answer to the OP, the solution would be to enable the virtual hosted network on the Windows 7 machine instead of an ad-hoc connection. This simulates a full router in infrastructure mode. You need to use the netsh command in an admin command prompt. Search "netsh hostednetwork", and you'll get the answer.
Verify that the ad-hoc network is functioning by using a third, unrelated device to connect to it, such as yet another Windows computer, a Linux or Mac, or another mobile device.
