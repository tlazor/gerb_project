2.Everything was fine on UAT system where users count was 20 but when we moved the same application to production system where users count is more than 80 , we are facing issue in Jboss regarding connection pool count. This count keeps on decreasing and after 8-10 hours, users are not able to login in the system so we need to Flush the connection pool manually by clicking the Flush button available in Datasource section in Profile tab.
3.We have checked there are no connection leakage, as we have closed all the database connection in the Finally{ } section.
1.We have a J2EE application using Servlets & JSPs running on Jboss EAP-6.2, and using SQL server database.
Question- Is there any way by which we can automate the Flush button functionality available on Jboss Adminstrator console so that idle connections will get destroyed automatically.
4.We have also increased the max-min pool size in STANDALONE.XML file and added some validation tags recommended by RedHat site.Please see attached file.
