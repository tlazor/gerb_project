Each PC has a shared folder that should be able from all other PCs. Who set up the network didn't put a Windows Server, but each PC has that folder shared with R/W permissions to "Everyone" (avoid insults for security, I agree with you ... awful job, but I cannot change it). Each PC has a name of type UTXX where XX is the number of the computer (01, 02, etc).
What I would like to ask you is: what you would suggest to do now to figure out what's blocking the other PCs from seeing the shared resources of UT03?
I have been working a lot into this problem and I would like to get suggestions on how to investigate further. This is the situation: I am working on the IT infrastructure of a small office (15 computers). This is what they have:
I have worked for 2 days to figure out what can be the cause, reading all the possible related topics. I have also reinstalled the computer from zero but when I install the block of software needed for their work, it stops working. I understand that there's a software changing something but I have no idea what. From UT03 I can see all the other computers and, of course, UT03 too. From another computer (ex. UT02) I can see all other computers as well as UT03 too, but when I click on it ... the error is fired and I cannot see the shared folders.
If I click on "Network", I can see UT01, UT02, etc. When I click on UT01, for example, I can see all the shared folders, access and edit files inside... Except for UT03, for which I got the error 0x80070035
I had the same error with several PCs in my network. I could not open shared folders of these PCs with the computer name. It was ok when I write the IP address.
