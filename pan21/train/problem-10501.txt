And, indeed, that includes SCCM. It's hard for any of us to say what will definitely work in your environment, but you could certainly pick worse places to start.
Of course, this is all easier said than done, but trust me when I say I've nearly every 'level' of educational IT.
But once you are over it, it will help a lot - the whole System Center suite. 800+ machines is WAY too big to run around to install stuff.
Forget you're a school and look at your numbers critically. You have 800 computers and nearly 2000 users. That's not a small company and I wouldn't really say "midsize" either. Schools IT is often neglected, but the truth is you should be using good quality enterprise hardware and software.
There's very little that's truly overkill for a network of this size - plenty that are too expensive, though!
I would not call 800+ computers "mid sized". I was successfully deploying the successor of SCCM in a bank with 850 employees. In your case it is a lot more likely nowt knowing your tools that will be the problem - somehow I have a problem imagining the team of 3 people in a school being the highly competent people that companies employ for a lot more money. The learning curve WILL be brutal for you.
