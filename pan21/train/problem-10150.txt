Exile them into their own forest is about your only hope here. If you set up trusts between the forest you can still access things on either side, and time-sync is less important there. For one, you're no longer doing any kind of global-catalog replication to time-variable domains. 
I second TomTom. Time is important to Active Directory. You can have multiple domains on a single subnet/network/LAN. It's probably your best bet, or make whatever application server you have be a stand alone server off any domain.
But it is a fundamental requirement of AD forests that all servers agree on a universal time. Time-shifting MIGHT be possible if you expend the effort to create your very own customized time-zones which define a distance from Universal Coordinated Time that the users need. I've never done that, nor do I know if offsets greater than 24 hours are even possible. But if it is, that's the only way to keep such a large offset in your forest.
Given that replication relies on timestamps there IS NO WAY TO DO THAT. Whoever set that up should have read "Active Directory for Beginners" first. Your only good choice is to totally isolate the subdomains into their own independant forests - then they can individually jump in time as they see fit.
