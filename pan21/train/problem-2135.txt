This happened to me when I changed my computer's default language from English to French. In French, commas (,) are used instead of decimal points (.) in numbers, and vice versa. In Excel I was still writing numbers in the English format (3.42) when it was expecting a French format (3,42).
For no good reason I can discern in my own case, the problem seemed to be the internal format of the time data itself, not the formatting of the function cell (and despite the fact I have formatted the entire column of numbers to various time formats and certain math functions like discrete addition yield the expected time based results)
I was having the same symptom.  The problem turned out to be a Circular Reference within the numbers I was attempting to sum.  I used the formula audit tool and had it point to the circular reference (which I had overlooked).  Once that was corrected, the SUM function worked as normal.
I fixed it by finding 'Change the date, time or number format' in the Start search box, clicking on Additional Settings, then changing the symbol for a decimal point to (.) instead of (,).
Anyway, apply @timevalue to all data in the source time column and then paste the result(s) into a new column. It will look the same but the sum and subtotal functions will now work on the new column. Doesn't seem it should be necessary, but there it is.
