There is a large selection of results that hold assuming PH does not collapse. Let $A := \forall i , \Sigma^{P}_{i} \neq \Pi^{P}_{i}$, i.e. $\mathbb{PH}$ does not collapse. Then such results can then be summarized as $A \implies B$, where B is the result proven. 
By a simple contrapositive, any such result is equivalent to $ \bar{B} \implies \bar{A}$, i.e. if the result does not hold unconditionally, then $\mathbb{PH}$ must also collapse. Historically, those results served two purposes:

Note: It is also not unusual that papers assume that $\mathbb{PH}$ does not collapse in addition to some other hypothesis, e.g. the (generalized) Riemann hypothesis. Then, the contrapositive simply shows that at least one of the hypothesis is false.
The collapse of PH is implied by the collapse of the Boolean hierarchy. The original result is due to Kadin [1]; it was refined by Chang and Kadin [2] to show that
