So if it dies, worst case I will be back on in under 40 mins.  It does mean I've got to be ready with shutdown -a when I'm using it.
I have a Windows XP machine that I'm accessing remotely which has tendancy to get into a weird state with the network connection - when you're on the machine locally it shows as connected still but nothing gets through.  Disabling and Enabling the network connection solves the problem.  I guess this symptomatic of a more serious problem, but I can't get to the machine to sort it out until at least Monday, so I was hoping to either find some utility or put to together a quick script to test the network connection (i.e. telnet google.com 80 or something) and restart the network connection if possible or else reboot the machine.  Googling on this suggests only really complicated lash-ups, and I don't want to lock myself out before I can get to it... Can anyone suggest something simple?  Or even a way to automatically restart the connection every couple of hours?
