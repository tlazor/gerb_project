Found By Changing windows Sound tab, Windows Explorer, Start Navigation sounds: to none. This got rid of my unknown noise every couple of seconds.
 Windows 7 has a search program and files toolbar (located on  the left bottom corner) after you press start button on windows( just below) All Files. If you go to start and type on search toolbar Devices, Windows gives you choices, amongst them was one command " Find and Fix Problems with Devices". When you click on it, Windows searches for problems. it did find E F,G:\,H:\errors, one by one it fixed it.  That's all!
In my case the be-boop was due to a bluetooth adapter (ASUS PCE-AC55BT) that I had installed but disabled due to another issue.  Win7 wants to keep trying to install a driver for it, hence the sounds.  Once I re-installed the driver and BT was connected, the sound stopped.
Test all of you USB connections. If there is anything loose it seems that it can make your computer play that noise, even if everything is functioning properly. I had a problem with a Western Digital external hard drive causing the same noise to occur on my computer (I have also read others with the same problem from these hard drives). Unplugging that  fixed the noise right away.
