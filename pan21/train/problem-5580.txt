After going through Video from 6.30 to 8.30(2 mins), My understanding is under RDBMS database(say oracle/Mysql etc) even i have to read two columns DBMS will read complete row from disc in memory then it will filter rows based on name coumn and finally read column salary. Is that correct  ?
Instead of relying on some dubious 3d party source, you should thoroughly review the official Oracle documentation, specifically, the Concepts Manual, more specifically, the sections on Physical Storage and Logical Storage.  That said, let me make a few specific points as they relate to your question(s).  First, Oracle does not really read rows from the disk.  It asks the OS to return 'x' bytes of data from file 'y', beginning at offset 'z'.  And the smallest number of bytes, the smallest unit of IO that it will request is the 'block'. And, it keeps a map, so it knows at what offset within a file each block is located.  All blocks within a given tablespace are teh same size, with the default being 8k. A block is a logical structure understood by Oracle but meaningless to the OS that is actually doing the I/O (or more precisely, transforming the request and passing it to the storage subsystem).  A block contains several rows, and the selection of individual rows, and specific columns, from the block is purely an in-memory (db buffer cache) operation.
Say I have 10 columns in Employee table where i just need to use two colums i.e. salary and name in below query
