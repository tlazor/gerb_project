This happens with every kind of keyboard I connect, no matter if I use the legacy PS/2 adapter, or USB.
I have upgraded my computer using a core i5 2500K from Windows 7 x64 to WIndows 10 x64, and the whole system runs fast and reliable, with one exception: after booting from SSD, which takes only about 10 seconds, my keyboard is really slow for the first 1 or 2 minutes right after booting. "Slow" means that when I start notepad, and type some characters, it takes a second for each character to appear on screen. Everything else is fast, including mouse movement, starting programs, only keyboard input is that slow. After 1 to 2 minutes, the keyboard suddenly behaves normally again.
Uninstalled Mouse and keyboard center and my lag delay in typing during startup on windows 10 was fixed.
This might be interesting for some people experiencing this problem: in my case, it was caused by EVGA PrecisionX running on startup - the first +-30 seconds were showing terrible lags when typing, waiting around 2 seconds for a letter to appear. 
Temporary typing lags are often caused by Windows downloading updates "in the background", or some other automatically updated software on your computer downloading updates.
