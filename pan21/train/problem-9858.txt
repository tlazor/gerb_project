Right click that, and pull up the settings.  Oftentimes, disabling the "tap to click" function makes it a lot less erratic, but you can control the acceleration, the "pinch to zoom" functions from there, too.
Try to go to control panel>Mouse and in advance tab Device Settings. And disable the touchpad. I think it's what you are looking for. 
If this doesn't work, or is not what you're after, considering actually disconnecting the touchpad (probably requires removal of the keyboard).
If you do actually want to disable it go to Device Manager, scroll down to "Mouse and other pointing devices", right-click on the touchpad and choose "Disable".
The touchpad on HP ProBook 4520s is just too sensitive. Is it possible to disable this on Windows 7.
If you look in the notification area (low right hand corner), you'll probably find an icon that either looks like a little touchpad (square with two buttons above it) or perhaps like a cursive O on a red background.  
Do you mean the mouse moves too fast when it is being used? Try Control Panel > Mouse > Pointer Options and drag the top pointer down to "Slow".
