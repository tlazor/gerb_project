Adding other Chip Enables is undefined. The CE pins are part of the SPI peripheral. I'm sure that it is possible to push it a little. I did this on a different chip a long time ago, but that was well before the Raspberry PI came out.
Of course you also need ground and power. And you also need one of the chip enable (sometimes called "Chip select" pins, CE0 pin 24 or CE0 pin 26.) In documentation these pins are written with a bar over the CE part indicating that they use a logical low for selection an a logic high for a non-selection.
The CE pins will only be driven low when for the duration of a transfer (well, really a few cycles before and after).
These pins are built into the peripheral. Changing these is not a good thing. You need to follow the directions that are in the Raspberry Pi SPI Documentation. Once you've gone through these directions, then feel free to experiment further. I suggest taking one step at a time. Add only one new thing and test it before going on to something else.
On the Raspberry Pi 3, there is one SPI bus, with two (and only two) connections. The pins needed are:
And I really think that you need to remove the extra boards because it's difficult to say where the problem is. Once you have simplified everything, then it should be a lot easier to debug, as @joan strongly suggested.
I really hope that your project goes well. I think that you went too far before you tested things. One suggestion is to keep a Raspberry Pi for testing purposes. I would install Raspian on this machine to make it as compatible as possible. I would also keep it clean of any additional hardware. That way you can test a new something new and know that no other hardware is causing that problem. Once you've gotten the code to work on that piece, then slowly add hardware until you've moved to where you want to be, adding new programming as you need to.
