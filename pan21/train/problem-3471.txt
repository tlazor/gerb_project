Our hoster has assigned us multiple public IP addresses. They are individual non-contiguous addresses e.g. 1.1.1.50 and 1.1.1.222. According to them the correct subnet mask to use is 255.255.255.0.
In reality subnets smaller than /30 cannot be used in the internet because you need minimum 4 addresses per subnet:
I do not understand why that is. My understanding is that the subnet mask is supposed to designate which addresses are considered part of the local network. But these are individual public IP addresses. There is no local network or subnet associated with them.
Plus you always need a gateway, too because without it you would be the only member of this subnet with no one to communicate with.
The difference is that your ISP has an assigned IP range of 254 addresses (or maybe more than one but this is the subnet you are in). Every ISP has that. This differenciates his subnet from those of other ISPs. Imagine the internet as just a network like every other.
If you don't have a mask assigned (larger than /32), you can't route traffic to/from it.  IIRC, some ISPs like Verizon often give you IPs with a /24 mask, because the GW is somewhere in their CO as opposed to your location.
The subnet mask advised by your hoster says that they're using /24 networks. The one you're saying shouldn't be the netmask can't be because that's the broadcast address (the first and last address of a network are not used).
