I suspect there is something miscommunication. Your other set of IPs is in a /29 (255.255.255.248) which provides 6 usable IPs (8 IPs total; 1 is used for the gateway and 1 for the broadcast). This is a typical small number of IPs a hosting company would provide you. Unless you've spent a good amount of money, I highly doubt they've allocated a /24 to you (255.255.255.0, 254 IPs).
However, this assumes that the gateways are on two different physical networks. It is possible that both routes are advertising on the same physical network, which, in that case, it is just the matter of ensuring that this gateway:
So it seems that when you ping 192.168.2.90, the packet is going through gateway 192.168.2.1. However, since there is no host on that network with the IP 192.168.2.90, it will fail.
Is reachable. If it is, you probably need to make sure that the following gateway is specified ifcfg-eth0:1 file:
I am assuming you changed the IP addresses from the real, public IP addresses to some fake private ones to protect the innocent (or guilty).
What does a traceroute from the outside to 192.168.2.90 show? The way you have it set up now it must go through 192.168.1.49. I strongly doubt this is the case (though it is not impossible, contrary to what mdpc said).
I probably suggest, though, that you talk to your provider and ask them what would be the appropriate configuration to be made on the server in order for your new IP to be reachable. They should at least give you the appropriate instructions for you to get started.
You also probably want to ensure that your server is forwarding the packet over appropriately with the following setting in sysctl.conf:
From what I can see, 192.168.2.15/24 is reachable because when you ping it, your packets will go through your provider's network, and someplace there, a router will send the packet to the gateway 192.168.2.1, which will send the packet over to server 192.168.2.15, which resides on the same subnet that the gateway servers. Likewise, when you ping 192.168.1.55, it will go to the gateway 192.168.1.49/29, which send the packet over to server on its subnet 192.168.1.50.
