If you go to 4:05 in this video of Google's "Shipping Contaier" data center, you'll see that the technician wears ear protection similar to what you'd find on a gun range or the guys helping to park airplanes. I think it's a good idea that doesn't hurt.
I always wear earmuffs when at my data centre (my company supplied them). It's very easy to get hearing loss in life. You can either be subject to really loud noise (over 110 decibels) and this will start doing damage very quickly, or you can be subject to /extended/ periods of noise that isn't quite as intense. You can do some research online in regards to how many decibels and how long you are subject to it, so tell how much damage is being done.
When I have to go to our datacenter, I usually bring my android phone with noise canceling headphones and I'll put on classical music while I work there. I hardly hear anything other then the music. 
I have a special set of earphones for my iphone that go in-ear; that way, I can block out ambient noise significantly, listen to music, and wait on hold for a support tech to answer some random question. Griffin's got a pretty good set for $30 or so. 
It's also worth noting that any kind of hearing damage is absolutely permanent. You damage hairs inside your hear that will never regain function. It also means you'll likely develop a ringing in your ears even when you're in a silent environment, and this will also never go away.
