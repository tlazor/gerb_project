Secondly that text can be a watermark too...which can be removed from a pdf creator software like Adobe Acrobat proffessional  or NitroPDF 
Try highlighting from the end of the passage instead of the beginning, or from slightly before the text you're interested in.
for restrictions removal you can use services like http://freemypdf.com/... but removing restriction from a PDF can be illegal as also warned by this site.. so it depends upon the content of the pdf.
If you can't copy because it's "encrypted" and the permissions don't let you, then just use a PDF password remover program.  There aren't any easy-to-use free ones that I know of, though.  Even most open source PDF programs enforce the no-copy, no-printing nonsense.  (although pdftotext doesn't care, and lets you dump the PDF to text).
The big letters which say "DO NOT COPY" were probably added to stop you selecting text and copying it to the clipboard. 
For my own use, I modified the source of pdftk to not check the restrictions.  Recent updates to the library its based on made me re-do that change, which I haven't gotten around to getting working yet, or I'd post the patch.
