I don't think there are any issues with storing your backups on a ext4 formatted disk. I think the Kernel supports ext4 since 2.6.28 so you might run into issues with ancient 2.0.26 Kernels. However I think most boxes should be upgraded to 2.6.32. And as far as I know CentOS6 also supports ext4, so if you don't plan to downgrade to CentOS5 or anything, I think you should be fine.
I was concerned that in the event of an emergency that an off-site backup has to be obtained quickly, the available servers might be older and not support ext4?
It's worth noting that you can mount ext3 as ext4. Do you need journal? Maybe that's a waste of time? Do you store backups in tars?
To be honest storing backups on standalone disks (which I guess are moved?) is not the best solution in the first place. What happens when someone - in rush! - drops the drive? Please consider tape/online backup etc.
We have been using ext3 for Linux server off-site backups. With everything else on CentOS 6 being ext4, I'm wondering if it would be a better idea to also have the off-site backups in ext4 too? The off-site backups are often LaCie rugged drives.
