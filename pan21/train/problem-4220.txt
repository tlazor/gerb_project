Buy a couple of cheap switches, put them on either side of the room and plug in the PCs on that side.  Run one cable neatly around the perimeter of the room, plug one end into your router and the other into the switch on the far side of the room.  Connect the other switch that's on the same side as the router.
How about something like a "backdrop support" ( Photo from shop I don't work for etc. etc). Can be obtained from a photo supply store, and fairly inexpensive. Put one in each corner of room, raise it to ceiling height, and run the cables across it with tie-wraps. Adjustable, portable.
Verizon FIOS routers implement MoCA, and used ones can usually be found on eBay for less than $50.  They also include a 4-port switch.  You would need one for both ends of your connection.
There's another option if you have coax (cable TV) outlets in both locations;  you can use MoCA adapters.  MoCA sends Ethernet over coax without interfering with cable TV signals. I use this in my house to communicate between the first and third floors.   Speed is comparable to a  wired 100Mb connection (a little faster than powerline Ethernet, which I also use.)
Well, you'll need another router for this, but this sounds pretty much like what dd-wrt client mode is designed to handle. You'll need a wireless router that supports the firmware, and you can connect the PCs on one side of the room to the ethernet ports on the router running in client mode (so you only need one device, and you can use conventional ethernet to connect those systems, rather than have multiple wireless adaptors), have the AP and other computers on the other side.
