In our case, the only fix was to power-cycle to wake up the RAID card, then reboot from rescue media and fsck the file system.
I'm afraid this is due to corruption on the filesystem or problems on the underlying hardware, since it's the root filesystem my recommendation is to boot the server again with a rescue disc (or in single user mode) and try to repair the disk through fsck.
I solved this problem in Arch Linux by installing "NTFS filesystem driver and utilities" using this:
I've seen this before when a RAID card went bad, and the ext3 journal file couldn't be written to.  At that point, the kernel marked the root FS read-only and wouldn't allow it to go back.
Nothing was logged about this, because of course the /var FS was on the same disc, and also RO.  dmesg, however, was pleased to tell us about the problem.  So, can you do a dmesg and tell us about the output?
Em temo que aixo es un sintoma de corrupcio al sistema de fitxers o de problemes del hardware subjacent, com es el / lo que et recomano es de rebotar el servidor amb un CD de rescat e intentar reparar el disc amb fsck.
