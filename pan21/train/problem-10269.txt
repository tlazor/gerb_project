From my basic understanding of SSH port forwarding, the SSH client software opens a listening socket on an IP:PORT, say 185.68.93.141:80. So if I go to my web browser and access somewebsite.com that resolves to 185.68.93.141, then my web browser will open a socket to talk to 185.68.93.141:80.
If you want to use 185.68.93.141 (or somewebsite.com that resolves to 185.68.93.141) as the main part of the URL in your local browser and still reach the remote sshd despite the lack of port 80 forwarding on 185.68.93.141, then you need to make the browser connect according to the above rules somehow. Sole ssh has no means to intercept traffic from browser that doesn't cooperate.
If the SSH on the remote host is listening on 22 and you can access it, what you can do is connect using a local port forwarding. For instance, considering a Linux client:
Alas, unbeknownst to the browser, it is not talking to the webserver, but the SSH client. The SSH client will send it over the SSH connection (through port 22, which is the only one allowed through the NAT and firewall) and the SSH server will relay it to localhost:80.
However, as I know from experience and a few google searches, you cannot bind a listening socket to an external IP. You get some "IP not valid in this context" error. 
The SSH client is binding to a port on localhost. The browser sends the request to the SSH client. The client forwards the request to the SSH server (outside the firewall). The SSH server connects to the URL. The SSH server doesn't have to bind to a port (other than 22), because in this context it is acting as a client, and the remote web server will pick up its default IP address.
Also, the reason that the browser is connecting to localhost instead of the IP address on the URL is due to the browser proxy settings. When you set up a proxy, the browser always connects to the proxy IP address (probably localhost in this case) and tells the proxy server the real address that you want to connect to.
After running the previous command you should see a new listening socket on port 81 (you can check with netstat -latn | grep 81).
