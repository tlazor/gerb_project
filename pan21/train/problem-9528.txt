The issue: on the main router, I have dhcp configured so wireless users are in 192.168.3.0/24 and wired are in 192.168.2.0/24 . Since all the soho routers are "wired", wireless clients connecting through those AP's get a "wired" IP. When the client moves to the range of the main router, it needs a new IP, thus breaking the connection for 10 seconds or so as Windows goes through the dhcp process again.
How do I go about configuring the wireless and wired devices on my main router to use the same dhcp  range?
I have my primary router running ubuntu, which has been working fine for my basically very tiny large-scale setup (if that makes any sense at all). I got a handful of extra soho routers which I decided I would  setup near a couple of wired workstations and configure them to extend the wireless network.
I set up all the soho routers to use the same ssid and security settings as the main router, and turned off the DHCP server option on all of them, plugged them in and everything seemed to work exactly as expected. So I got back on my laptop and walked into the room where the main router is and the connection "dropped" (laptop is running Windows XP).
