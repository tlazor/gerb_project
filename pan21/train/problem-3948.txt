Currently I keep audio recordings on a PC, with a backup on an external HDD. I keep a subset of these on a couple of USB audio player and some more in a mirrored directory between all the PCs I use. Video material is either on a PVR or on DVDs. I do use Magnatune, but just for downloads, no subscription.
I have a Linux box that acts as a media server and music player. The device itself is an Intel Atom board with Creative X-fi in it's single PCI slot. Only problem - no Gbit LAN and no PCI-E ports. The box integrates nicely into an existing Windows network. I use Debian Linux distro.
I use Windows Home Server.  It can be expanded to have any number of hard drives, can be backed up without much fuss, and can stream the media to any DLNA device in the house.
As for hardware one could get an inexpensive AMD board with 6 SATA ports, Gbit LAN, PCI-E and a more powerful CPU if needed. As JP said, HDDs are cheap these days - go for RAID 1/5 just in case.
Option 4 combined with option 2 and all DRM-free media probably gives the most versatility. Option 2 would be my second choice, but that probably requires DRM-free and a licence that allows backup copies (e.g. in the long term there is little point having backup copies of the downloaded media if they can only be played on one particular hardware player).
As for cloud storage, I doubt it's usefulness for large volumes of media - the bottleneck will be your Internet connection and bandwidth will get wasted for fetching stuff you've already downloaded anyway.
