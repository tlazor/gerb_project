I've also read about building your own NAS with freeNAS but those setups dont allow you to run XBMC.
I currently own a WD Sharespace and I am not too happy about it. It will freeze constantly and its rather slow. I've been thinking of replacing it. 
I run XBMC on a couple of Zotac mini-ITX ION PCs as clients to a Linux server that stores the files in my basement.  Instead of trying to bundle everything into one HTPC, I think it is much better if you run a separate NAS box in your closet or basement and then a quiet client.  I'm upgrading my Linux server to a Synology DS1511+, but their two-bay DS211j (about $200) would take a couple of identical disks and do a great job for you.  Depends on how much you want to store.
I got a Drobo 5N and installed Plex on it. I'm actually quite happy with both the Drobo and Plex on it.
Even though this question is pretty old it is still getting quite a lot of views so I'll contribute what I actually ended up doing.
FreeNAS is also very cool.  I'm just not certain how it performs network-wise and your power consumption for an old PC is going to be higher than a specialized NAS, so you may pay more in the long-run.  The primary reasons I'm moving from my homebrew Linux fileserver to Synology are power consumption and speed.
I also own a WD HD Live, and it works like it is supposed to, but recently I've seen XBMC in action and I was quite impressed. 
I've been wondering lately about the possibility of replacing both products with one new device: a fast reliable nas which I can install XBMC on and is capable of rendering video and has an HDMI out.
