We've got the following network set up in the office (I don't know all the details, but this is what I know): A SonicWall Wifi router acts as a the gateway between the network and the internet connection. This provides wifi access and is also plugged into a large gigabit switch, to which all the PCs in the building are connected to via Ethernet cables. At the other end of the office, I've got a TP-LINK TL-WA901ND Wirelss Access point that's plugged into the network via an Ethernet cable and is set up as a Wifi access point using the same SSID as the SonicWall's but on a different channel.
This setup seems to generally work well. Devices are able to connect to the TP-LINK access point with no problems and access the network normally. They're also able to connect to the SonicWall wifi when it's closer and have no problem accessing the network through that either.
The problem is that every few days, the TP-LINK access point seems to just stop working - it no longer broadcasts on Wifi and you can't connect to it via wireless. It needs a power cycle in order to bring it back up again. 
The interesting thing is that the same thing used to happen with our previous Wifi access point, which was a Netgear WN802T that was set up in exactly the same way.
