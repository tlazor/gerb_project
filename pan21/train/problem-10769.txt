I am using Putty on a Windows machine to ssh into another server. Once there, I am trying to use X11 forwarding to pop windows onto my computer. The remote system is not the issue since it is a large system that is successfully used by many other users in this same manner.
Recent Cygwin updates have changed its X server to not listen for TCP connections by default. Instead, Cygwin's X uses (the Cygwin implementation of) Unix domain sockets, and PuTTY (as a native Windows program) doesn't know how to use these.
I log into the system via Putty without issue and then run startxwin in cygwin. However, upon running xterm in Putty, I am given the error xterm Xt error: Can't open display: localhost:##.0 where the pound signs are two integers whose value changes each time I log in.
It's for xming, but perhaps this faq is of some help? The idea behind it is the same but using xming instead of cygwin on your local machine. https://wiki.utdallas.edu/wiki/display/FAQ/X11+Forwarding+using+Xming+and+PuTTY
This is less secure than Cygwin's new defaults; it should only be used on a single-user system, and configuring your firewall to block connections to XWin may be wise.
and replace it with a direct invocation of xinit with my desired options (add -listen tcp and remove -auth):
Unfortunately, the issue persists. I've exhausted my Googling resources on this topic and so I would greatly appreciate any help. Thanks!
