Remember, a FEX should only be thought of as a remote linecard of the upstream Nexus switch i.e. it doesn't perform local forwarding between ports. The topology you are describing would be like sharing a linecard between two chassis, something that doesn't really happen (I know people could argue that this happens in VSS or nV though).
The reason it isn't supported should be posed as a different question: 'Why WOULD you dual home a FEX to two separate N7ks?'
Dual-homing to a single N7k is a supported topology so I'm guessing you mean dual-homing to two N7ks.
I want to connect FEX directly to Nexus 7k as dual home.. but recommendation says not to connect FEX with 7k as Dual home.. I want to know the reason.. Please help.
If you have a server with a single NIC then you can only connect it to a single switch anyway. So even though you want to add redundancy upstream, you will still have a single point of failure where it connects to the FEX. Cisco's rationale is that if you really want HA for a server then you would have two NICs on it. Each NIC would be connected to a separate FEX that are each dual-homed to a separate N7k.
