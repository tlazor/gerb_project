Figured out the problem.  The HP EliteBook 8540w has both a USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 controller onboard.  The USB port I was using was one of the USB 3.0 ones.  I finally gave up on AHCI and just installed in IDE mode.  When I got into Windows after the installation the USB floppy and mouse I had attached all stopped working.  Tested all the USB ports on the system, found two that the newly installed Windows could recognize.  Connected the USB floppy to one of those ports, re-enabled AHCI through BIOS and ran through the basic installation again.  Worked fine this time around and am currently installing all Windows updates.
You can install other driver packs besides the "Mass Storage", but this will bloat the size of the XP install to DVD size, The only driver packs I suggest to slipstream are
If you use other customizing software such as Nlite, use that first then driver packs last, then make the iso, or install problems will result.
This will keep it a size to fit on a CD. If you want all the drivers slipstreamed it will require a DVD burner.
I don't change any of the default settings when using the software, just pick the driver packs you want to slipstream and create the ISO image.
I do not know why the setup can recognize the USB 3.0 ports as legacy USB devices at the beginning of setup and not at the end of setup.  And I doubt that this is a common cause of this issue, but hopefully this will help someone else at some point.
