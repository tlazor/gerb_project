There are other projections such as MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) that try to find a low dimensional embedding such that the original distances are best preserved as Euclidean distances now.
If, however, your features are all highly variable and uncorrelated, your first few PCs may not capture a sufficient proportion of the variation, in which case your distance metric will look quite different.
I would expect your original distance metric to be recapitulated reasonably well in your PCA-reduced distance metric, particularly if your first few PCs capture most of the variability in your data. The first PCs capture the greatest axes of variability in your data, so the last few PCs are relatively invariant across all samples, and will contribute less to the distance metric. You can imagine a case where you have 3 informative features, and 27 features that are invariant. Your first 3 PCs can perfectly represent your dataset, and will produce the exact same distance matrix as the original space.
PCA usually involves scaling the data. Hence it will not preserve the original distances. If you'd only use the rotation then it should preserve Euclidean distances. The question then mostly is: why? 30 is not much. Just keep all 30?
