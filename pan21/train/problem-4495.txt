The issue is if I print the same document from the Client and the server, some 3 cm is lost in the buttom of the page when printed on the server.
I am facing a issue with printing on some printers via RDP using the easyprinting feature. The client is windows 7 Home, and the servers is Win2K8.
You can try printer redirection software from FabulaTech. It allows redirecting printers into RDP or Citrix session, and doesn't require any additional drivers to be installed on the server.
Another possible fix (if the client printer is networkable) is to create a port forward on the client router for 9100 to the printer itself and create a printer on the RDP server that points to that using the correct driver. I've had to do that when using some sort of HP All-In-One that needs a particular driver and doesn't like printing through RDP. If the client has a dynamic IP I would suggest a free DynDNS account and pointing to the hostname instead of IP.
Install the printer driver on the server and see if that resolves the issue. Any other method (Easy Print, Fallback Printer, custom print inf, etc.) is a hit or miss proposition. Microsoft has done a pretty decent job of making priting more reliable in RDP sessions but it's not perfect and some cases boil down to installing the driver on the RDS/TS server.
