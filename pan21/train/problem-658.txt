There are probably many ways of doing this, the most obvious one that comes up is using one 12V battery/power supply, and wiring its output to your appliance using some sort of relay switch modules. Ideally you would want to use a pair of 3-ways switches, which can be controlled digitally. I'm not sure what's avaialble on the market, but ideally that's what you'd want to use.
The reason why i'm including normally closed switches is to ensure that you can't short circuit the power supply by a mistake in your GPIO controlling software.
What i know for sure that's available and cheap and would work for you is simple on/off realy switch modules.
You would control the switching action of the normally open relays with the rpi GPIOs so that, if one pair of relays is switched, 12V is supplied to your appliance. And another pair of relays would connect -12V to the appliance. And you should probably also include some sort of protection from short ciruciting your power supply, maybe some normally closed relays, which open with the same signal as the normally open ones. Something like this picture would work.
You can see that i have included 8 switches, of which 4 are normally closed and 4 are normally opened. in this example all the switches are controlled by 2 GPIO from the RPI, without being specific let's calll them GPIO_X and GPIO_Y, as you could pick any 2 GPIO.
