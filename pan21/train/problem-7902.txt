This is a very delayed reply but I am very happy two weeks into this fix. My IT person also saved this to my download folders as the Windows system may remove this download or override the driver controls and you may need to do this again, should your device show similar symptoms in the future.
1) I had a defective battery, it was replaced easily with a new one. Symptoms: Computer always ran HOT, Battery was beginning to bulge out from the bottom of the bottom which prompted the deeper dive into the issue.
2) Something about the Windows updates will change the thermal control settings prompting the fans to remain on and continue to show that the system is need more cooling that it needs... 
My company IT directed me to a fix and I wanted to share that with anyone who may be having this issue.
