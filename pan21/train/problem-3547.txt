The last resort to me is to add a url to the php server that will return 200. However the status of this url may not 100% reflect the health of the wordpress site (which may go down due to mysql issue for example). If it is indeed the last resort, what is the best way to implement it? I am not proficient with php developement.
You can use your WordPress installation front page for the health check. This is the most reliable indicator that the WordPress site is available.
For what it's worth, I had to set-up a WordPress site in a container and get a health check to succeed before I could even get traffic directed to it. The suggestions for the "front page" work only AFTER WordPress has been installed through the browser. Prior to that they return a 302 status code to /wp-admin/install.php. I noodled around in the container folders and decided on using /wp-includes/images/blank.gif as the health check path. This allowed the health check to succeed and traffic started routing to the container. From there I installed WordPress through the browser and was able to change the health check path back to /.
Is there any way I can define a page in wordpress that will return 200? Hopefully it will not require additional plugin because I would like avoid maintaining extra plugin.
