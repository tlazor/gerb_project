You could use VNC on your RPi and on your laptop to have a remote access visually. Just search the internet for a good VNC client, I personally use TightVNC.
Finally, this link gives you everything that you need to know to start getting the Pi's GUI running on your laptop using VNC (Linux and OS X only, if you don't have Linux then grab Ubuntu and install it on your laptop).
Hey guys I hope that this question has been asked so many times.Live in India & I am new to Raspberry Pi hack. All I have is an old laptop of mine, HP DV6700 to be precise. It doesn't have an HDMI port (It has a VGA port, some long hdmi like port & a S-video port)  & I don have a TV which has an HDMI port. I want to connect my Rpi to my laptop to use it. What are the things that I should buy? Thank you.
Also if you'd prefer to use the Remote Desktop Protocol (this could be useful if your working at a company that blocks VNC's ports, most companies at least allow outgoing RDP connections) then use XRDP on the RPi and just normal Remote Desktop on your windows machine.
Well since the question is "What to buy?" here's one answer: Get a TV card (or a dedicated video capture card, but TV cards are more common) for the laptop with S-Video input. Such cards exist in USB, PCMCIA and ExpressCard formats and will allow the laptop to capture input from S-Video and display it on its screen. The main (and possibly only) advantage of this method compared to methods shown in other answers is that other devices with S-Video output could use laptop's screen too.
