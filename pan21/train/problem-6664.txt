At the time, I found this to be the best method for my needs.  Creating an empty cron.deny file in /etc could potentially replicate the same performance.
On a typical system, you should not have to (a) add anyone to the crontab group or (b) edit cron.allow.  The default behavior is, absent explicit configuration to the contrary, to allow everyone to run cron jobs.
