For $pMax$, we took the highest value from $p1$ for the x component and the highest value from $p2$ for the y component.
We want to get $pMin$ and $pMax$. $pMin$ should be the lowest value for all the components. $pMax$ should be the highest value for all the components. That would make calculations a lot easier of course.
When going to the third dimension, it is still exactly the same. You just do the same for the z component as you would do for the x and y components.
I get where the confusion comes from, but the explanation meant something else. It meant that when $p1$ and $p2$ are given, they are not always ordered so that $p1$ is always $pMin$ and $p2$ is always $pMax$. So we need to find out. However, it could be that when solely looking at the x-axis, $p1$ is $pMin$, but when looking at the y-axis, $p2$ is $pMin$. So, we need to find $pMin$ and $pMax$ for each of their components, seperately.
If we would only look at the x component and determined $pMin$ and $pMax$ from that, we would get $pMin=(2, 6)$ and $pMax=(7, 4)$. This works for the x component, but it makes no sense on the y component, as $pMin$ has the highest y value.
We can see that for $pMin$, we took the lowest value from $p2$ for the x component and the lowest value from $p1$ for the y component.
The bounding boxes are still the same. We still store the same rectangle, we just used different points to store it.
