There is a great misconception about JPEG files. Actually, JPEG isn't an image file format - it's a compression algorithm. JPEG specs don't describe how to pack compressed image into file. There are two (mostly compatible) formats for that: the older JFIF and the newer EXIF. Most modern software will also accept mixed formats.
EXIF is a data collection system used in jpeg files taken on cameras to provide state information (thumbnail, exposure, ISO speed, date, time, location, etc) about when the picture was taken. Since it is native to this type of file, Windows allows manipulation of a subset of the data (similar to MP3 file tags). Other files that can have EXIF information are TIFF and WAV files
So EXIF isn't a tagging system. Entire JPEG image files are in fact EXIF (or JFIF) files and tagging is one of EXIF's features. GIFs don't use EXIF at all, so you can't put EXIF tags on them.
GIF is an older format that may have text headers, but the format never was extended to include EXIF information.
