As soon as all your machines have refreshed onto new leases in the correct subnets then you can extend your leases back out to something more reasonable for your environment.
With most (if not all) your users gone for three months now would be a perfect time. That is assuming you live in an area that observes summer vacation.
If you're using DHCP and you want to clean it all up you have many choices. If you're using private IP addresses you can just move them to different private addrsses in a new DHCP orderly fashion. If you're using public addresses the problem is slightly trickier, but not impossible.  The trick is all in lease management.  Even if you aren't planning on making the changes soon you can shorten up your leases now, so that they will all churn much faster when the time comes.  This is especially important to do early if you have very long lease times.  
When your change time comes, Set your leases to a VERY short lease time, like an hour. When the leases expire make sure that the new range you want for the area is in effect there.  This will let you roll your DCHP changes over a weekend. The problem is all the machines have to be on for this to work, and your existing leases have to be pretty short.  It won't actually require rebooting everything.  
Since you are working at a high school, why not use the summer break, and a weekend, to take everything down and rebuild it the way you want it?
For our campus wide re-iping plan I am have suggested that we move all our IP addresses into a private range for a short while then move them back to where we want them as soon as everyone is over, avoiding the rolling update method you are trying to avoid.
