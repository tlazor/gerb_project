That makes it available to your host, but not other people's hosts.  You need to either run a local DNS server and point all the clients to it (harder) or see if your router/NAT box will let you do what you want.
If only a few computers, just create a hosts file with the correct IP details and store in the appropriate place on those computers.  That is how people did things before DNS was invented!  If you have a large network, you surely have DNS somewhere...
mDNS works by broadcasting the DNS request on the LAN so it doesn't depend on a centralized DNS server.
On Ubuntu (and Linux distributions in general), Avahi is responsible for managing mDNS requests. All the servers who need to access your machine will need to use an mDNS system also.
I strongly recommend to use DNS server, like bind (apt-get install bind9) or djbdns (apt-get install djbdns).
I would really advise you do use a DNS server (or at least to distribute a /etc/hosts file using Puppet for example), but mDNS can do if your need is limited.
