Do you have a Arduino?  If you do, just hook it up to it and see if it runs it.  Also, maybe you are not feeding enough power/not any.  A final thing to look at is if it is grounded.  If the pi is running on battery it has to be grounded.
Maybe your test code is not correct. Today I've used wiringPi library and succussfully light up the LCD1602 and show tempreature on it. DVK511 use the GPIO ports like the following:
I recently got a pi and it came with the a DVK511 board a number of other things, such as a LCD1602 screen. I have the custom raspbian image on my SD card that my pi is running, and is currently booted off of. However, after attaching the ribbon cable to the DVK511 and the Pi, the DVK511 has it's lights on, and if I plug the LCD1602 into the correct pins, it's screen lights up a light blue. However, when I 'make' the LCD1602 test program that comes with the waveshare version of Rasbpian, and then run it via LCD1602_Test, nothing happens on the LCD, and a few LEDs on the DVK511 flash. I tested the LEDs to make sure I had the board connected to the raspberry pi correctly, and they worked. Did I do something wrong or is the LCD defective? 
Your LCD may actually be working correctly. It may simply be a matter of the contrast being set incorrectly. To correct this turn the knob or screw on the contrast potentiometer. You should try turning it both clockwise and counterclockwise. Ideally you can do this while the Pi is sending text to you display, but depending on its position this may not be possible. In this case adjust the screw in one direction and test. If that fails try turning the screw in the opposite direction and retest.
