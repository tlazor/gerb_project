I looked through some superuser.com answers that were similar, but they didn't appear to be close enough to my configuration.
GRUB "ls" yields:  (hd0) (hd0,msdos1) (hd1) (hd1,gpt6) (hd1, gpt5) (hd1, gpt4) (hd1, gpt3) (hd1, gpt2) (hd1, gpt1)
My hope-slash-expectation was that to boot Windows 10, I would just change the BIOS boot order with "HDD first" (with no USB attached); for Ubuntu, "USB first" (with USB attached). GRUB appears to have a presence on my SSD now.
On a Toshiba P35W-B3226 with Windows 10 installed to internal SSD, I have created a dual-boot Windows 10 / Ubuntu 14.04.5LTS machine with Ubuntu 14.04.5 installed on a 64 GB USB pendrive. I used Rufus to create an install USB device using the 14.04.5 Desktop ISO (since the Toshiba has no CD/DVD drive) and installed 14.04.5 successfully on the destination USB using the "Something Else" selection during the Ubuntu install, creating a primary partition on the destination USB drive to hold the bootable / executable Ubuntu O/S. However, I have encountered a couple of problems:
As an alternative, once I get the GRUB command prompt ("HDD first", no USB attached configuration), is there a way I can tell it to boot Windows without the Ubuntu O/S USB attached?
