I took it to the Genius Bar. Evidently, a "hard drive bracket" inside the MacBook had to be replaced. The hard drive itself is fine.
I've had more than one drive "fail silent" without a sufficiently horrible death as to generate an audible mechanical sign of failure. It seems pretty clear that this is probably a hard drive failure - if you have an external enclosure, you could use that to make sure its not the connections inside the machine.
i had the same issue on a mid 2010 macbook pro 15" core i5 series notebook, it was due to the hard drive. the drive in question was as seagate momentus with the flash memory of 4gb built in and i believe i caused the issue by moving my notebook around after closing the lid and before the hard drive head had parked, so i ended up damaging my drive physically. my system would randomly freeze prior to the complete failure and i was lucky that i had my time machine on a network nas device, qnap, at the home office to restore from. you might be able to get data back if you maybe sent it off to a recovery service. you could also try putting the old drive into a usb caddy and plug it into another mac or pc ot see if it mounts the data.
If its in warranty, its time for a trip to your friendly Apple Authorized Service Provider, or the Apple Store. If it's not in warranty - well, sadly, its time to buy a new drive and find out how well your backup strategy works.
