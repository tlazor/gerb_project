If you are attempting to track the WAN link and you are receiving an Ethernet hand-off from your provider, I would suggest tracking the ICMP reachability of an IP address within your service provider's network. Physical interface tracking will not help you in the case where there is an L2 failure beyond the handoff interface between you and your provider.
This is very rough config based on referring to CCO; I will see if I can find something a little more polished in my notes.
The way to do this is to create an IP SLA monitor operation, and create an object that tracks the state of the operation. The tracker object can then be used to decrement the HSRP priority of the LAN interface when the WAN interface goes down. This will vary depending on the code version you are running, but sample config below:
The first option would be to track the first hop router (I'm guessing 12.12.12.2 from your example?); a better solution would be to ask your ISP for the IP of one of their DNS servers or similar.
