My theory is that the power supply to the drives can't handle the load. When you issue the grow order, all the drives in the array have to start doing real work. This consumes more power. The power supply can't deliver and the voltage to the drives dips. Once the voltage gets too low, their motors shut off briefly - causing the clicking sound as their heads get moved to safety position, and their logic controllers lose communication with your SATA controller - causing the errors. When the motors shut off, the load on the power supply is reduced, and the voltage it puts out recovers to normal levels. So the drives start back up and the cycle repeat.
You could try another power supply, removing a couple drives from the system (not easy I know) or removing other sources or moving them externally (for example, maybe attach fans to another power supply.) Or, you could try rebalancing the drives to different cables from the power supply. (You could also check the power supply's ratings and the ratings of the attached devices and see if you are in safe range.)
