You should have backups of you data on another drive, if not, back it up Now until you determine if it is a bad drive or a power issue.
Sectors marked as "bad" do not necessarily mean physical damage, an unreadable sector is marked as "bad" but may just be that, unreadable due to corrupt/weak bit signatures, bits that are neither 1 or 0, buy lie somewhere in the middle. 
I would connect the failing drive to another PC as a secondary drive and run Spinrite6 on Level 5, see if it can recover the bad sectors, (level 5 will check all sectors, even the ones marked "bad" and mark them as good if there is no physical damage, if Spinrite recovers a high percentage of the bad sectors, then you know it is not physical damage but more than likely a power issue, a bad PSU in the original PC or too many devices on one 12v rail of the PSU. Lastly, the controller board (PCB) on the hard drive is bad.
Other smart data shows it has other problems than bad sectors also, the drive is malfunctioning for other reasons than bad sectors. It could be a bad power supply or power connection to the drive causing all the problems, weak power to the drive will cause writes to the drive to be weak also, causing this "bad" sector problem.
