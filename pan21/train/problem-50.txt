This script will automatically find your "Public IP Address" and then update your NameSilo DNS A records.
This script was taken and customized from http://www.forkrobotics.com/2014/10/dynamic-dns-with-namesilo-and-powershell/
This script can be used to update your A DNS records for the main domain (e.g. somedomain.com) and also for your subdomains (e.g. subdomain). You can create one line for each domain/subdomain you want to update.
I used it for connecting my client PC to a Team Foundation Server (TFS) over the internet. The server and client are behind NAT. I set the local and remote ports to '8080' and I can connect to server from client using this address on client: 'http://localhost:8080/tfs/'
Couple of things to note, you will need to Login to your NameSilo account and under API Manager -> Generate an API Key which you need to enter in the batch script above to replace <NameSilo_API_Key>.
Keep both the files in the same directory. UpdateDDNSIPv4.bat is the batchfile which should be called by Task Scheduler in your recurring task.
However if you have your own custom domain name that you'd like to use, you can use the DNS services from NameSilo (http://www.namesilo.com) as your DNS provider and the powershell windows script below along with a scheduled task to replicate the Dyn/NoIP service.
One way to keep your "dynamic IP" in sync with your DNS is by using a service like Dyn or NoIP which provide their proprietary Domain names/Domain names to purchase.
Assuming you're running windows, here's a simple script that you can "schedule" using Task Scheduler to run on StartUp/Logon and then rerun every 6 hours (that way the maximum downtime due to an IP address change is 6 hours).
