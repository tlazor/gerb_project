When I turn on the Pi by plugging it in with minicom running, I get the 'T1' LED flashing on the serial adapter card, presumably in time with the boot sequence.  By itself, nothing appears on the minicom screen.  
During this bootup if I hit a key on minicom, the R3 light turns on, and stays on permanently.  However, I see the remaining bootup sequence, and it returns to a login prompt.  But I cannot type anything to log in.  It responds to no keyboard input at all.  I have a feeling it has something to do with the R3 light being on permanently.  I am doing something right, because a single keyboard tap works to force the Pi to send or the PC to receive the bootup stuff.
I am trying to make the GPIO serial port of a Raspberry Pi 2 with Raspbian Wheezy work with an elevator (to control its movement and check status).  But before I even plug it into the elevator, I am testing whether I am sending signals correctly from it.  As I was having difficulty, I thought I would first test to see if at least my hardware setup is correct, so I reinstalled Raspbian so that the serial console would be re-enabled.  I figure that if I can at least get the serial console up and running, I am not wrong on hardware.  
What could I possibly be doing wrong here?  Is it a minicom setting or am I using the MAX3232 converter wrong?
I'm plugging it into a PC serial port directly (I found that using a 3m cable made it return garbage to minicom, so is the power too low or something?).
