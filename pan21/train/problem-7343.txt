Though from a high-level functionality perspective they're very similar they have vastly different management interfaces and scripting APIs.
An answer to that question highly depends on wether you talk only about clients or if you think about using Mac servers as well. 
Should you consider to newly establish an environment with MacOS Server as a server OS, you should think twice. Since Apple will discontinue the XServe systems in January '11, they will have no viable Server system available to run MacOS Server on because Apple's suggestion of either the Mac Mini or the MacPro as a server isn't a real option. 
The big difference is that there is no WMI on OSX.  It's a different sort of animal. Group policy for mac is called managed preferences.  Apple has put together a webcast on what's available.  See Best Practices for Mac OSX client management
Given this fact, I highly doubt they will actively continue to really develop MacOS Server or their XSan product any further, leaving their customers with some products that are in desperate need of major feature enhancements and which, in their current form, can only satisfy very basic needs. 
All in all I would say that while Mac clients are a fine choice for small to medium sized businesses or education and research lab applications, they are a poor fit if you expect to manage hundreds or thousand of them in a big organization they way you would do with Windows machines. 
One of my current environments consists of a few XServes and around 100 clients (mixed Mac and Windows) and while the decision to use this system was reasonable when I introduced it in 2003, I wouldn't do it again today and in fact, will start to think about the future replacement soon.
