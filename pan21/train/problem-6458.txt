Those are somewhat incompatible goals: either it's a completely accurate image of the filesystem, or it's reorganised to be an ISO.
Are you using Linux? What you could do then is burn an image of the filesystem as a file within an ISO, and then mount it as a loopback device.
My real question, though, is: which software would recommend for this purpose - and do you think this is even the best solution anyway?
If you are just backing up to another hard drive, and are on Windows, you can use RoboCopy to simple copy all the files themselves off to the other drive.  It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that.  I have 2 drives and I was going to RAID mirror them, but decided it was just easier to set up a scheduled task to copy all the files from one drive to the other every night. If you want compression, you can probably just put everything in a big 7-zip archive on the other hard drive.
You can use some commercial software which supports this (e.g. Ghost and use ghostwalker to open an 'explorer window' to the inside of the image, or you could create a full backup with dd and mount that via loopback.
I want to make a complete copy of my hard drive (and I have the capability to boot off external media to allow for unmounting of hard drive partitions).  However, the majority of "ghosting" software I find only allows me to make images that are not really mountable or explorable ... in other words, I want a complete and total copy of hard drive, but I want to be able to explore so that I can recover individual files or folders if need be, and the best solution I have found is to build an ISO from my hard drive and mount it whenever I feel like it.
