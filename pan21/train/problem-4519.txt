As GeorgeB mentioned you could look at the log on the switch with the "show log" command in privilege (#) mode, or I believe if you did the "show arp" command from the (#) mode you should be able to see all of the connected devices, their MAC address, and their IP address in the results.
You can then use: show ip device tracking all.  Instead of using all you can enter an interface or an ip address to show these commands.
As far as I know there is no straight solution for this. In your case you can create a MAC address based ACL and bind it to the VLAN in which those SwitchPort exist. Of the two MAC address block one. Detection of the problem this way will be quick with a little obstruction in network service. You can refer to this configuration from Cisco doc.
ravi babu .. the best way to clear the ip conflict ,if DHCP is enabled in your network just give ipconfig /release and ipconfig/renew in both the pcs . If you gave static ip in your both the pcs .. then go to network settings and change the ip on both pcs. I don't think in the switch you can achieve this ,unless you have to shutdown any one of the switch port.
There are a few ways to do this.  Is your switch running layer-3?  If it is, then you can review the arp table on the switch for duplicate entries.  You can also turn on ip tracking on the switch and then go through that data.
