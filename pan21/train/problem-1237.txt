By lazy unmounting it, the folder dissapear from my hierarchy, and is hidden. And when the background process end, it is successfully unmounted.
I use lazy umount in cases where it was obviously stuck for various reasons (such as nfs server down), also when I need to see the original content of the directory that was mounted over by the mount. In both cases the mount is busy. I think there are other edge cases but these 2 are the most common reasons I used the option.
You're using rsync to perform your backups and walk away. You can umount -l the drive and once it's finished copying and synched, it unmounts, so that when you come back after a break (that you know will take longer than the backup) you can just unplug the drive instead of having to fiddle with the keyboard again.
When the disk is mounted, nautilus build up previews (I think, I am not sure), and lock the files. When I want to unmount it, it says that it is locked by another process.
If you have a daemon on your system that constantly interrogates /proc (I'm looking at you ksysguardd), then you will be unable umount /mnt/proc.  Lazy will let you umount in this case.
