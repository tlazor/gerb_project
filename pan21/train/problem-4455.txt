You could use Perforce Replication to have a second server on their network, which can stay in sync with the main server. This introduces a small risk that simultaneous checkins in both location, but Perforce may have something in place to mitigate that.
Why do you think hosting externally will make a difference? If if's a reasonably fast machine with a good network connection it should perform similarly to running on AWS, unless you put it in a data center between your users.
Our company have been using perforce hosted on WMWare. It works fine for Local (US) developers but the team oversea is complaining about its performance. Migration to the cloud may resolve the problem. What could be cons of that move?
What's causing the slow down? Is the CPU limiting? Network bandwidth saturated, or not enough bandwidth? Network latency? Problems in the local network of the remote developers?
In general moving the cloud is going to cost you more, increase latency and performance for local users, and you need to consider security. AWS is secure, unless you make your VM insecure through poor configuration. You also need to consider availability (hosting in two AZs), backups (EBS is not as reliable as S3), and probably a bunch of other factors. In general though it should work fine, just have someone who has AWS experience set it up, ideally someone with AWS architect certification.
