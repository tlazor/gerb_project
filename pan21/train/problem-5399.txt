If that's all you're doing, then you're perfectly fine using HDMI. If you plan on gaming, though, I'd recommend keeping an eye out for performance issues. They should be readily apparent.
*Note that these issues that I described can also depend on the software you're running and the drivers you have. My experience may not directly translate to yours. Ultimately, the best way to find out is to try it yourself and see what happens.
HDMI shouldn't cause a difference in image quality vs DVI. However, you will have to worry about bandwidth issues. These issues really only occur if you're intending on playing computer games. Over HDMI, I found that some games I tried to play would cap the refresh rate at an abysmal 24 Hz, which translated into a lot of image tearing and headaches. However, I found that it was perfectly fine for typical desktop/office tasks and movie watching.
I agree with all the comments regarding your particular situation. There will be no difference in video quality. However, to answer the question in a general case ("Is there any benefit of using HDMI over DVI?"), some differences can be stressed I think.
HDMI and DVI are both digital video signals. The advantage of using HDMI over DVI is that HDMI carries both audio and video over a single cable and for DVI you will need to run two cables one for the video and another one for audio. HDMI is the latest as far as technology goes and all the digital video splitter, extender, matrix solutions are HDMI. All the devices these days have HDMI ports on them. So I would recommend going with HDMI.  
AFAIK, there is a major advantage in using HDMI when it comes to sound (e.g. when watching bluray movies). 
Video quality alone, they are the same. HDMI also carries sound, as long as it's supplied. I have heard (although not confirmed) that audio can be carried through a DVI cable, but I haven't heard it IRL
