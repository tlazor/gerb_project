The Wikipedia answer Teun posted is correct but is pretty dense and hard to follow for someone who is not up on EE terminology. Here is my attempt at a less jargon heavy version.
Signals are transmitted as a voltage difference between the two wires in a pair while power is transmitted as a voltage difference between two pairs. Ethernet is transformer coupled so the transmit and receive electronics only see (in principle, nothing is perfect) the voltage between the two wires of a pair. The power connections are taken from a center tap on the transformers so they only see the voltage between the two pairs.
"The answer is through the use of phantom power—power sent over the same wire pairs used for data. When the same pair is used for both power and data, the power and data transmissions don’t interfere with each other. Because electricity and data function at opposite ends of the frequency spectrum, they can travel over the same cable. Electricity has a low frequency of 60 Hz or less, and data transmissions have frequencies that can range from 10 million to 100 million Hz"
The large difference in frequency also helps keep the signal and power from interfering with each other but it's not the primary separation mechanism (unlike with POTS).
Some POE adapters will not work with gigabit. If your POE is gigabit compatable it will say on the adapter.
