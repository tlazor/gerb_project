If you don't have too many users in the system (say $n$) then you can create an $n\times n$ matrix, $M$ over a time period that represents the communications between users. The component $M_{ij}$ could be either $1$ or $0$ if user $i$ and $j$ communicated or the number of times that they communicated.
If you have more data then you would want to represent the data in terms of nodes and edges. Nodes would be the users and edges would be the presence of a communication. This can be done manually or by using a library such as NetworkX. 
There's a couple of approaches you can take depending on the nature of your data. It sounds like you're trying to detect social anomalies in your data so you need to model the communication boundaries between them which leads to some sort of graph representation.
I'm developing a model for unsupervised anomaly detection. I have a dataset representing communications between users (each example represents a communication): there are many features (time, duration, ...) and the ids of sender and receiver. My question is: how to represent the link between those two users?
