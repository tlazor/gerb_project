Q: Is there any chance I can somehow create a Global Catalog, SYSVOL and NETLOGON and turn our Domain Controller into a viable PDC?
2) He asked me to take a look because of a seeming annoyance: the Active Directory for Users and Computers (dsa.msc) fails with this error:
Or alternately standup a new DC and make it the PDC, then remove AD from your current PDC, reinstall it, and take all roles from the temp PDC.
2) Both dsa.msc (Active Directory for Users & Computers) and dssite.msc (Active Directory Sites and Services) snap-ins fail with Naming information cannot be located.
4) Most things seem to work.  Active Directory exists, users can log in, the databases and 3rd-party enterprise software installed on the server all work.
You could also make any other server your Temp PDC by installing AD to avoid standing up a new server. I would leave the temp AD server as your secondary DC after you get the roles all transferred though.
1) Some time ago, a colleague did a clean install of Windows Server 2008 R2, promoted it to Domain Controller from an old Windows Server 2003, and life seemed to be good.  In the meantime, a bunch of software was installed the on server.
Is it possible to standup another server, make it a DC, seize the roles from the current 'broken' PDC, and then re-take the roles back onto the PDC? Then simply remove your 'adhoc' DC from the domain? 
1) When I try to seize the relevant FSMO roles, ntdsutil reports "FSMO transferred successfully - seizure not required."  So this is not the problem.
