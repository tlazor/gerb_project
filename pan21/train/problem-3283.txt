The answer is that, if you have a functioning domain, you don't replicate anything. The domain controllers do it for you. If you have separate sites and subnets set up for the DCs, they might be on a schedule or throttled, but in general, it happens fairly quickly and without your input.
Now, my follow-up question is, what the hell are you actually doing? AD will use as many LDAP transactions as it needs to replicate anything that you're doing, I'm sure it won't be limited to one transaction and that's it. When companies with more than 5000 users add new domain controllers, that initial first sync doesn't typically cause problems, unless the new DC is across a slow WAN link (in which case, they should have staged it locally first and then shipped it.)
Windows makes it so easy. Simply add another domain controller. dfs does it all in the background. It is part of how AD works. You can control replication with Sites and services. Properly define your sites and the cost of each site trunk.
/edit - also, please stop referring to primary and secondary/backup domain controllers? You made it clear that you're not running an NT 4.0 domain.
