If I slightly shake it, turn it on its side, and then leave it alone for a second, the screen will now be in a horizontal orientation.
I had the same problem and Ctrl alt up simply would do nothing. I got tired of of using the touch pad so I re-installed my mouse. Voila ctrl alt up now worked 1st time.
With a windows 10 laptop I had the screen rotate by closing the lid (whith it set to do nothing when the lid is closed) and carrying it to another room.
The only problem is that it is not very accurate so I have had to shake the laptop, and twist it around to try and get the orientation right.
This must be using the accerlometer in the laptop to detect motion and then change orientation similar to what an iPad would do.
After messing with the laptop I realized that if lift it and move it around, the screen will shrink and get a black border and then after a second will come back to full screen in whatever orientation I have the laptop.
I am familiar with the CTR+ALT+{Arrow key} shortcuts but those didn't have any effect as I don't believe I have the right driver installed to support them.
Really bizarre but hopefully this helps someone else out there who gets stuck with an odd orientation and the short cut keys don't work.
