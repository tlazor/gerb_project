To directly burn an .ISO or similar data disc image to CD, remember that the drive encodes and decodes the physical pixels using CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reedâ€“Solomon Coding) to allow for read error correction. You would need to figure out what data bytes correspond with encoded written-pixel-data streams.
This looks like it does what you want, it includes 2 MATLAB files which I don't quite understand the magic of. I'd love to see an updated version!

which mentions CD usage, based on rscode's example.txt I believe the code to implement CD-type encoding (what the error-correction encoded pixels on a CD-R would read) might be:
I had some success with Red Book CD Audio using bytes (8-bit characters) of 171 decimal for dark areas and 48 decimal using the Img2CD program. I couldn't get the calibration perfect, but for line-art you can see images in the CD-RW. No hacking is needed, all it is is a WAV music file with this non-musical signal--it's as real as a music CD as the rewritables will allow for (older CD players can't even play CD-RWs with human listenal music on them!). When you're done you can then play the CD-RW on a newer audio CD player that plays rewritable discs and listen to the picture. And if you get tired of the image, just blank the disc and re-write something new. The disc is best viewed under direct sunlight.
