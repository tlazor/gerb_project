Does such a program exist? And for super awesomeness, it doesn't happen to exist as a winamp plugin?
What I'd like: I'd like to be able to tag the individual files, similar to how you would tag photos on Flickr, or questions on this site. It's very difficult to search for this, since every "mp3 tagging" search ends up with ID3 taggers, which is not what I'm talking about. I'd imagine that this program would let you add tags (eg: "instrumental, cowbell, party") and then you could easily find all your "cowbell" tracks.
Songbird with the Tag Cloud Generator add-on looks like it will do exactly what you are looking for.
You're looking for a library manager, which is one of the things iTunes does, but then so does a number of other programs, such as Media Player, SonicStage and RhythmBox. I'm not sure you will find a plugin for WinAmp to do this, but now you have another phrase to search for.
Well, for what regards winamp: why not using any of the unused ID3 tags? I mean: you could use the "Composer" or "Publisher" fields to write whatever you want... and then find anything from within winamp.
