The reason this is coming up is that I recently got software to download YouTube videos in the expectation that I could eliminate buffering and lag problems by doing that, but when I watched the downloaded video, it still had the lag in it! (When YouTube lags, the video stops and spinning circle thing appears in the center)
Streams should not be re-encoded between servers, but rather being copied. Encoding is a one-time phrase. Otherwise the quality would degrade with each re-encoding.
Is it possible to have lag inside a YouTube video stream? By "inside", I mean the stream itself is not lagging but the content has a lag inside of it. I suppose this could only only happen if the stream was being redirected and re-encoded somehow. In other words lets say the video is on a server in San Francisco, and a user in New York is requesting it. If the stream is first sent to, say, Chicago, and is then re-encoded in Chicago and there is lag between San Francisco and Chicago, then the resulting stream would have the lag built into it.
But, that said, I have actually seen someone upload a video to youtube of a show that they recorded off of their cable and they got lag, so the show itself gave this circle, and it was in the recording. You can test this by pausing the show. If the circle stops spinning, its in the recording. If it doesn't stop spinning or disappears completely, its a connection issue.
That said, it is likely your connection to the server you are streaming from is lagging or your internet connection itself or even your CPU. Especially if you are on a high-quality stream and your CPU can't keep up, it will appear as lag too.
