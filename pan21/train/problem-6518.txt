Here’s what I do.  Start on your last page.  Take out the continuous Section break (csb).  Insert Next Page break in its place.  Back up to the next CSB And repeat this, working from the back page to the first page.  I NEVER use CSB’s because of the issues you described.  Note:  you will have to go into each footer in each section and turn off the connection to previous footer if you want the footer to be different.    The only time I would use a CSB is when using columns.  
I'Draft' view you can delete the "section break" and add "page break". This is the only thing that worked for me, and I started having these issues with MS 365, but not in prior versions.
Go to "View", select option "Draft" view, then it shows where you have "Section Break (Next Page)" - if your document does not have that then it will continue showing the same section, even if you select "Insert/page break". I think sometimes this function Insert/page break" gets stuck and keeps inserting "section break" instead of "page break". 
Go into Header/Footer mode and see if "Link to Previous" is highlighted, per the following screenshot:
