Just as an FYI, if you use word 2007, if you install Office sp2, you can create PDF's natively, without using an addin. They are often much cleaner, as they make them as a text document, and not as an image that many others do.
This is hard.  As others have said, pdf is more an output format, not to hold content, so it's not particularly editable.  It has a lot of layout tags in it and to read it takes a lot of effort.
OK, so I am very late in answering this. But this answer may serve others who stumble upon this question.
That said, OpenOffice allows you to import a pdf as a drawing.  It's somewhat editable, but formatting will probably be way off.  It won't look like the thing you are importing.
LibreOffice Draw can import PDF files. After that, you may place text boxes, lines, shapes, images, clip art, etc. anywhere you like. You can also edit and move these later on. To delete something, you may put a box (or text box) over it. If the original file is in editable format, you can edit and rearrange existing text as well. Otherwise, you can put additional text and drawings on top of the existing content, anywhere you like. You can edit multi-page documents as well. At the end, you may save the file in Draw format for further editing, export it to PDF, or both.
