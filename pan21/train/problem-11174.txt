You see how you never talk about your hardware EXCEPT: "while there is still empty space on the drive"? I would not run something that hard on something with A drive - more a number of independent SSD for performance reasons. It is quite obvious that there is a signiicant discrepancy between the required hardware and the available hardware.
Now the data inserting is very huge(390120 rows per minute on average) and I should have the records of atleast 2-3 days.
Start optimizeing your setup. Moving to MongoDB will not change that you have obviously hardware totally unsuitable for the task at hand. Paging errors are brutal - paging means not enough RAM and should not be an issue on a sql server.
Also, are you using staging tables? How are you builk uploading? Some of the bulk upload mechanisms are not so nice (table locks) and you want to avoid that (staging tables). 390120 is NOT very hugh - last time I had do so that I was hitting around 60000 rows per second. Make the math. On a low end server that by now hits around 12 years age - but has around a dozen SSD.
I have a table in SQL Server 2016 for which I am receiving data from an API. The data was in XML format so I have to break it into columns and bulk saving it into SQL. There are 32 columns in the table including identity and almost all the columns will be having data(means very few null values).
