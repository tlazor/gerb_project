I have set up an enemy prefab that gets instantiated during Start. Each enemy object has a health bar GUI object attached to a Canvas which is a child of these spawned enemy objects. So, when I spawn 10 enemies, 10 health bars get spawned as well. I have another GUI object for the inventory which I can open and close at the press of a button. When I open my inventory and there are enemies behind it, their health bars show on top of my inventory. I would like to layer the GUI objects such that these enemy health bars do not appear above my inventory. How do I do this? I have tried ordering them differently in the hierarchy as per someone's suggestion in a forum post, but that didn't seem to work.
If the inventory canvas is in "World Space" mode, then you just need to make it closer to the camera than the other World Space canvas elements.
If you want the canvases of both UI elements to be rendered in Screen Space - Overlay mode, you can use Sort order to layer them in the desired way. The higher the sort order number, the later it gets rendered, and thus, the "closer to the front" it is.
If the health bars are in "World Space" mode, which they should be in, and the inventory canvas is in "Screen Space - Camera" mode then you need to set the distance of the canvas from the camera. 
If the inventory canvas is in "Screen Space - Overlay" mode, there really shouldn't be a problem like this, since it will be overlaid on top of everything else.
