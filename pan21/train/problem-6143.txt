Go to Computer Management\Services and change the TeamViewer service from Automatic to Automatic (Delayed Start).
Also check your registry to confirm that all traces of Teamviewer have been removed - it's possible that some remnant of the service registration is still present. 
Service Control manager will by default wait up to 2 minutes for a service to start before deciding that it can't be started - this would most likely explain the delay before the GUI components and Task Manager become available.
Suddenly my PC started taking a long time to boot. I have windows 8.1 on an SSD so it's usually pretty fast, like 20 or 30s from pressing the button to desktop, most of it is the motherboard stuff. Now it gets to the desktop making good time, but it just hangs there, with most of the shortcuts without icons (as in white files), not opening the programs that are set to start with windows and it won't let me open the task manager. I can open other programs with no lag at all, like firefox or matlab. After a couple minutes it snaps out of it and the startup resumes, the taskmanager finally opens, the icons load and Avast and that stuff continue starting.
I tried disabling TeamViewer and the computer effectively starts up normally. I tried reinstalling TeamViewer and the problem persisted.
