As you can see the WiFi AP is attached to the corner of one of the buildings and aimed at the metal building. The X in the image is where the computers will be residing that need the WiFi.
The place that I work at we have two buildings next to each other and one across and in-between the two that is made out of metal. We want to extend our WiFi coverage to the inside of the metal building so we purchased a Hawking multi-function access point (HOWABN1). We've got it mounted and facing in the direction of the metal building, but I can't seem to get the signal to stabalize inside of the building.
Is there something I should do to make the signal better? If I could, I'd run a cable to the metal building, but the connecting conduit has collapsed and we'll end up spending more money than it's worth to repair it.
Right now I have the AP configured as a Universal Repeater, and I've also had it as an Access Point, but neither seem to be providing good enough signal. As of right now if I sit in the room with the X with my laptop I'll get 1 bar of signal strength and PINGs are 50/50.
