editing can be done with sudo defaults write or any other plist editor you happen to prefer (or a text editor, as long as the file is in text/xml format; if not, use `plutil -convert xml1' to convert it).
However, it sounds like what you really want is a packet-filtering firewall.  No problem, both can run in parallel (well, series actually -- traffic only gets in after going through both firewalls).  So you can go ahead and configure ipfw however you want (use WaterRoof, or build your own script to configure it and use launchd to fire it off, or whatever) and not worry about interfering with the regular firewall.
BTW, it occurred to me that there's an exception to what I said about the GUI not touching ipfw: if you turn on Internet Sharing (in the Sharing pane in System Preferences), it activates ipfw to divert packets through the address translator.  If you want to use this feature, I'm not sure how to make it and a manual ipfw config coexist peaceably; its setup is not at all configurable.
Mac OS X v10.5 actually has two firewalls, ipfw (a packet-filtering firewall like you're probably used to), and AppFirewall (aka alf, which filters programs attempting to listen for incoming traffic).  AppFirewall is new in v10.5, and is the only one the GUI deals with at all (except on OS X Server running in advanced mode -- that has a GUI for ipfw).  AppFirewall isn't terribly configurable, it basically has lists of programs and whether they're allowed to listen for connections.  If you want to look at its config, use
