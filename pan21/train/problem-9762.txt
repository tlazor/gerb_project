Plain HTTP cookies are specific to a browser. But there are other technologies that can achieve similar functionality as cookies. Techniques called "supercookie" or "zombie cookie" can be used to restore cookies after user deleted them. This often uses Flash or other plugin storage. Now if this storage can be shared across browsers, the mechanism will recreate cookies from one browser on the other. Another way is to get some machine identifier - if you can consistently obtain machine id, your webserver can recognize that browsers are installed on same machine, and synchronize cookies between them.
Absolutely not, cookies are an application level not OS-level feature. There is also no facility for a webpage to access cookies other than for their explicit domain in the current browser, in the same way there is no functionality for a webpage to access any files on a user's machine unless given explicit permission (eg. a file upload).
In short, a browser cookie will not be read across browsers as long as you quit a browser before using another.
