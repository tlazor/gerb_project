I won't say there are no implications on your system, as I have no idea what strange things your might have done, but I've never had any on mine. After all, it's just a password. 
Of course, it might be easy to create systems where the root password is stored somewhere for some purpose, but I would consider this bad design to begin with. 
What are the implications of changing the root password? Is there anything that will be affected? I'm using a private shared SSH key - I assume I do not need to change this as it is not tied to the root account password.
Keys that are already authenticated through ~root/.ssh/authorized_keys will keep working after the root password has been changed. And if you always authenticate using a key, there is no need to know the password.
If you log in as root by using an ssh key, then you don't need the password. I have multiple servers on which I have changed the root password to be a random string of characters which is not recorded anywhere.
If you can't afford to risk it, then consider restoring your server from a backup, or if it's a virtual machine make a clone of it, and test resetting the password.
