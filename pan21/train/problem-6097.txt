Primarily looking for Chrome, as that is my browser of choice.  +1s for suggestions for other browsers. 
The thing is, I do appreciate being served all this awesome content by people who create and host it.  I am more than happy to view advertisements and click on those ads I feel are interesting.  Its part of the provider/consumer implicit contract that keeps the superhighway trucks full of awesome cool caturday pictures and other things.  
What I'm looking for is some kind of plugin/addin/app that only blocks popunder advertisements spawned by clicking on non-content parts of a webpage, or that can be configured to provide only this type of ad block.
One of the greatest annoyances I experience almost daily while browsing the intertubes are popunder advertisment windows.  Usually, they are triggered by clicking on the window somewhere, thus converting my desire to bring focus back to the webpage into a purposeful click on an advertisement link.  Its a d___ move and imho the equivalent of tricking me into clicking on an ad.
Because of this, I do not want to use some generic adblock-type software that removes all advertisements from websites.
