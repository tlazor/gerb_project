When redrawing the desktop, it will make a slight impact on performance. Redrawing a detailed bitmap usually takes longer than redrawing a solid color. The difference isn't as noticeable on newer hardware, though.
The problem is that Windows likes to swap ‘unused’ memory out to the pagefile even when there's no real need, there being memory to spare. That's normally not a problem, except for if you're working in a full-screen application window, your background image isn't being rendered; its memory becomes unused and gets swapped out to disc. Then when you finish working and unmaximise the window, it suddenly becomes needed; several meg of rendered background then has to be dragged back off the disc and copied back onto the screen. On older, slower machines like laptops this was very noticeable.
If you are using some kind of remote access (via network / internet), then turning off the background will increase the transmission speed of your desktop.  From my experience, a background image effects the performance very little (unless your running a netbook with little memory or something).  It will chew through a bit of memory however, a 32bit 1920x1080 image will consume a bit over 8MB of RAM (not much of an issue of you have 8GB, but might be an issue if you have 512MB or less)
This was the case for WinXP; it may have changed in Vista/7 since, due to the increased usage of video-card-accelerated rendering.
Yes it will. It uses certain resources (I am not sure how) If you have a good hardware you don't have to worry about it but if you need 100% of your performance and you are doing tasks that are slowing down your PC then turn off your wallpaper.
It can certainly have an impact on a machine with virtual memory, in my experience. (That's the default and how most machines run, although for newer machines with multigigabyte RAM there is a good case for disabling it.)
