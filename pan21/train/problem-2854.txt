There are a lot of answers about advantages of different disk solutions, but there's another option, too. You could simply have more than one web server, and serve different parts of the site from different servers.
A third option is to use mod_proxy, to forward certain requests to a second server without rewriting it. The downside to this is that all requests for images will now be passed through both servers, affecting CPU, memory and network. Even if they're not a problem now, they may be in the future.
You could also do this by using mod_rewrite, so that when a browser requests a resource from /images /whatever.jpg it will be rewriten to http://images.yourdomain.com/whatever.jpg.
One possibility is to split your site up based on the type of resource. E.g: Much of the content is images, so you set up a separate webserver with the hostname images.yourdomain.com. Then you change all the links to images in your application to no longer point to e.g. http://www.mysite.com/images/image1.jpg and instead point to http://images.yourdomain.com/image1.jpg.
