This happens to me sometimes when I copy and paste email contents from Gmail into a Microsoft Word document. All the column/table formatting is coming along for the ride.  You can avoid the problem entirely by being careful how you choose to paste the text into Word. Don't go with the default.  Choose a Paste Option that doesn't retain the source formatting.
If the text was copied from a website, maybe it's inside a table. If that's so, try copying only the text and pasting it outside the table, and see if it gets wrapped properly.
On the ribbon is the "Paste" button, if you click the down arrow the "Paste Special" option is there.  From the paste special window you want to use the "Unformatted text" option.
Try to select the table and then check Table Properties and set the "preferred width" to 7.5" or whatever size will fit with your margins.
If you copy the entire contents of your document, then "Paste Special" that will clear any and all formatting that is currently on the text.  If this fixes it then it is a page/paragraph/etc formatting problem.  Which is probably the case, it's just hard sometimes to find what or where the formatting issue is at.
