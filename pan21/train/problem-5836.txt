Li-ion batteries self-discharge, which can be 2 - 3% but per month, not per day. So, if you want to avoid self-discharge, put the battery in the fridge. But then you have less capacity because of the cold, so you have to wait for the warming up... Complicated?
However, while using the battery (the next day), it will warm up again, and recover its capacity. So the 'remaining time' will decrease more slowly at the beginning, while warming.
Batteries are strange (and complicated) things. They have more capacity when warmer, because the chemical processes are more efficient.
So, if the battery was measured while the machine was ON, then it has more capacity than the next day, when the battery cools off. Also, the microprocessor in the battery pack estimates the capacity by temperature and voltage. It's not an exact science.
Remove battery, keep it removed for one day , insert it again and now check your charge percentage. If it is drained, then there is something wrong with battery. If not, then issue is with lap. Check if USB power on when laptop is off option is enabled like @Tom Hundt suggested. Another possible reason can be battery getting short circuited. Get you laptop checked by service center.
