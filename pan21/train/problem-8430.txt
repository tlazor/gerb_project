This change may cause the connections to stop working, if the routing table on Machine B is incomplete. What happens in this case is that packets are delivered correctly to Machine B, but it does not have a route to deliver the replies back. That will either make it not respond at all or send the responses to the internet instead of to the VPN server.
On Machine B you can try adding a route with the following command ip route add 10.200.200.0/24 via 192.168.0.10
This can be achieved through the use of a tunnel. There are various kinds of tunnels, that could be used. One is to use VPN, which might be the simplest since Machine A is already a VPN server. Then you just need to make Machine B a VPN client, and then add routing table entries to forward the needed prefixes through that VPN connection.
On Machine A you have a NAT rule, which cause it to change the client IP before routing the packets to Machine B. The first you need to do is to remove that NAT rule, such that packets are forwarded to Machine B without modifications.
Another option is to use a GRE tunnel or simply IP over IP. Those tunnels and associated routes could be configured statically, which would give them an advantage over the VPN approach.
Since you found that the connection between Machine A and Machine B is not really a switched Ethernet, and that it can only handle traffic using the IP addresses you have been assigned, you need to find another solution.
