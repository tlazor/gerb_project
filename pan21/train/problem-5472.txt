I would to replace <span class=”pagenum”><a name=”Page_4” id=”Page_4”>[Pg 4]</a></span> with " " such that it finds the pattern for two and three digits, as well. I am new to this regex string search therefore, I would be grateful if anyone could help me with a replace string for the same.
I imagine that matching <span class="pagenum">.*?</span> will be sufficient, as only this span class is likely to contain the page number data you want to eliminate. Note that .*? will match the minimum number of arbitrary characters, ensuring the that the  in the match is paired with the same leading . – AFH 12 hours ago
I have big file catering to 1000+ span class for pagenumbers. I would like to remove the complete syntax with the text in notepad++ through a ReGex. Example,<p>Cillacepro di to tem endelias eaquunto maximint eostrum eos dolorit et laboria estiati<span class=”pagenum”><a name=”Page_4” id=”Page_4”>[Pg 4]</a></span>Cillacepro di to tem endelias</p>
Would like to thank @AFH for providing generic answer which could cater to Page, Pg and other types as well.
