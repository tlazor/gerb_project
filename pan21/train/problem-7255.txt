... and noticing that the OS is loaded as Firmware, as well as reading the installation instructions... I'd have to say that No.  There is not any way to get it to boot to a USB stick to install Ubuntu.  Even if you could... the device doesn't appear to boot to the 4g of flash memory the unit uses for storage.  The unit boots to the OS embedded on a ROM chip and uses the flash memory just for storage.  Think of it like an Android touchpad with a keyboard... or a big phone.  The instructions for loading the OS are very specific, and require using files designed for the process.  Click the Installation link at the bottom of the product page and read them, to see what I mean.
THAT said... some hard core geeks have modified the version of Android.  One such geek post here with links to the modified ROM and Source files.  http://www.worcesterdwi.com/thread-67136-1-1.html
I have a Craig CLP281 netbook with Android 2.2 on it.  I'd like to try running a minimal version of Ubuntu on it, but can't find out how to get it to boot from a USB stick.  I can't even get into the BIOS settings.  Does the CLP281 have a BIOS even?
