The need for a solution to my initial question came up when I needed two Bluetooth connections. I have been doing individual tests on the same Pi; however, the final system should be handling two Bluetooth connections at once. If I dedicate one Pi for the connection with the PS4 controller and the other will handle the phone's sensor data, would I be able to connect both Pi's to the Mega with a USB Y-cable for the means of data transport?
If not, does anyone have an alternate solution? My research has only left me with more unanswered questions.
I have a project in which a robot with two pi cameras, and 2 dedicated Pi's are connected to a robot. The navigation is handled by a PlayStation 4 controller (via Bluetooth) and there is a pan and tilt servo combo, controlled by an Android phone's accelerometer (also via Bluetooth). 
In general: yes, there will be a way to connect two Pi's to one Arduino given the numerous ways the Pi's can connect to the world and the number of interfaces on the Arduino Mega (I'll refer to the Arduino MEGA 2560, but as far as I can tell the "Mega" predecessor share these characteristics). 
So, does anybody know if it is possible to connect 2 Pi's to a single Arduino board (more specifically the Mega)?
