On a different vein, if you have more than a couple of servers, hosts, etc, it's well worth the investment to use a central log server.  If they're housed (and backed up) from one source, it saves you the headache of having logs on the rest of your hosts piling up and taking space.  Log data is gold, but if I have 20 api servers all serving up traffic, and I get hit with something like a DDoS, not having aggregation of my logs means I'm looking for a needle in a haystack.  If you're going to store your infrastructure logs (and you should!) then store them once, on one robust backup platform.
The puppetmaster or chef server in these cases can be a potential point of failure; again, automate rebuilding them as much as possible, and have scripts on hand to allow existing nodes to bootstrap to a new server management host as quickly as possible, in the event that the old box is knocked over.  I've found it can sometimes take significantly longer to rebuild this sort of host from a backup, than to stand a new one up from scratch (and restoring from backups can unintentionally reintroduce the same flaws or issues that caused it to go down in the first place.)
