You can also use process substitution to accomplish the same thing. You would redirect <(find) into the done part of the while loop.
Now, it does find the correct folder, but every time there is a space in the dir name it makes it a newline.
I'm trying to mv The Trance Mix 3 Wanderlust - DJ Exortius [TRANCE DEEP VOCAL TECH]@ into the real directory DJ Exortius. DJ Exortius already exists, so it's just a matter of moving it into the correct directory that's based on the id3 tag of the mp3 inside.
I'm trying to get my music folder into something sensible. Right now, I have all my music stored in /home/foo so I have all of the albums soft linked to ~/music. I want the structure to be ~/music/<artist>/<album> I've got all of the symlinks into ~/music right now so I just need to get the symlinks into the proper structure. I'm trying to do this by delving into the symlinked album, getting the artist name with id3info. I can do this, but I can't seem to get it to work correctly.
You should pipe find into while instead of doing for $(find) in order to properly handle filenames with spaces in them.
If you use hard links instead of symlinks then you can leave your unordered pool in place while using EasyTAG to restructure the links.
PS: I've tried easytag, but when I restructure the album, it moves it from /home/foo which is not what I want.
