Few years ago we migrated our DB2 from 9.7 to 10.5. We also moved the database to new hardware and implemented data compression. Because of this we decided to create the database from scratch and export and import the data. 
Step 1 Use script to extract schema from production server in specific order (db2look for tablespaces first, db2look for tables next, etc..). Using specific order reduces number of iterations for step 2 & 3.
We used db2look and db2move to do the job. However, there was no way to get the DDL created by db2look in the correct order. We had to split the generated script into different parts for creating tables, creating triggers, creating indexes, etc. 
I have used following approach to copy production schema to test servers for developers. Trick is  to ignore errors during individual runs and compare schema at the end to make sure everything is recreated correctly. I know it is not a clean approach. I have done this against schema with over 1000 tables, 500 functions with dependencies, constraints, etc.. You can automate the steps using shell script. It  requires lot less effort compared to writing parser and testing it.
