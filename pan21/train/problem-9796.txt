I'm running Linux server with OpenVZ containers. I back up data with rdiff-backup in two steps (to minimalize downtime). First step is on live containter, and second step is on suspended container.
This website lists the different ways of doing it.  If you have LVM that is really the best.  One thing I would make sure of is that if you are running any database apps, to do a database dump of all the databases before backing up the container (ie mysqldump).  
I would also recommend LVM which I'm using to create snapshots which are they transferred using rsync to zfs (on Linux using zfs-fuse) to enable writable snapshots which I use for quick point-in-time recovery by starting new container over it.
I don't work for them, I backup about 80 servers every day with it and it's never failed me. Yes, it costs money, but you get what you pay for.
If there is one concrete suggestion from my experience, I would suggest to design backup strategy based on your recovery requirements, and not on limits of current setup. Re-installing server with LVM is pain, but until we get better support from filesystems like btrfs, it's first step :-)
