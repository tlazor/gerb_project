If you want to double check it's got the key, just to go the settings -> system and look for the activation message.
Basicly Windows checks if hardware changes were detected on the device. If it's a small device like a mouse, storage, ... then it won't complain. Changing your CPU or Motherboard can cause a problem. You should be fine with just transfering the data to your SDD. Hopefully you can give us the answer when you're tried it, there's no real damage in just copying from HDD->SDD and trying it to see if it works.
Once you've finished the setup, gone through the tutorials etc, you can repeat the above steps, sign into your microsoft account again, and then it'll check and use the licence.
Next proceed with your install of your new ssd, install windows as normal and when it asks you for the 'CD Key' - just choose the box which states something like 'I dont have the key right now'.
Having done exactly this myself I found the eaiest way to migrate the licence safely, was to first assoicate your account with a microsoft account (i.e. hotmail, outlook.com, xbox, etc).
