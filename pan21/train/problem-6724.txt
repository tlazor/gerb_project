I have a System76 Clevo rebrand W25AEU laptop.  The motherboard is model 6-71-W24E0-D03.  It started getting difficult to turn the machine one and I assumed it was do to the cheap method used. One day it was working, turned it off, and immediately tried to restart. Everything lights up and things start spinning, but in less than a half second it turns back off.
So, after a lot of messing around I found that with the ram removed the computer will turn on and stay on for a minute, maybe more.  Oh, important: I never tried this why connected to a monitor to see if it has errors or such things.  RAM in and it turns off.  I also found a high temp 105 C, 330 uF, 25V capacitor that looked like it leaked (electrolytic).  It is component PU223 and part of the Vcore 1 system.  This system is right after the RAM power supply check during boot up.
Any thoughts guys? Could the video cause this behavior?  FYI, intel integrated graphics.  Do you think everything in the boot sequence is good up to that point? Or if that is very likely?  Oh, I bought a new motherboard and used all the old components except the MOBO and it is going solid for about a year now.
