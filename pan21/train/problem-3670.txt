Local account is a well-known security identifier (S-1-5-113) which is similar to a group, except that membership is implicit based on a rule: in this case, all local accounts are members.
This is much simpler to achieve than I originally thought: all you need to do is to grant the "Allow log on locally" right to Local account.
Is this do-able?  I'm not opposed to start-up scripts if there is a registry key I can populate dynamically or something.
I have used a "Allow logon locally" GPO on a few machines to restrict who can use them. It is annoying that I have to create/link a separate GPO for each set of machines/users (Where is item-level targeting when you need it?), but now I'm running into a more difficult problem...
If you also grant "Allow log on locally" to a local group that you create, you can use group policy with item-level targeting to add the domain users that should have logon access to that group.
Is there any way to configure some kind of hybrid between "Allow logon locally" and Group Policy Preferences where I can target specific users/groups to add or remove from local groups without needing to specifically define EXACTLY who is in a group? Basically, I want to layer removing logon for all AD accounts, then allow login to a few, limited AD groups and all while not touching the logon ability of local accounts. 
I need to restrict the AD users that can log in, but also allow ALL local accounts of which I may or may not have knowledge.  We have machines created/supported by external vendors who create local accounts for local administration/configuration and/or testing. Those local accounts need to be able to log in, and they are not necessarily in any special, local group.
