Yes, you can put the original drive back in to get stuff off of it. Windows might no longer be activated after activating on the SSD, but normally this shouldn't affect you. Even if it does, you should be able to boot and use the computer unactivated for a short time. And if you had any issues, you would still have the option to buy an external drive enclosure and access the HDD from the SSD installation.
So I've got a rather puny 50 GB HDD in my laptop. I just got a 250GB SSD that I'm going to install Windows 7 using the same Product Key that is tied to that laptop, essentially giving me 2 hard drives with the same Windows install on them. I've put everything that I believe is essential on to a flash drive (from the 50GB) to migrate it onto the SSD after the install, but if I find I overlooked something, would it be possible to put the original 50 gigger back in to get anything else and then reboot with the SSD to save it? I know I could get one of them fancy cables and hook it up to my USB, but I was wondering if I could just boot it up with whichever hard drive I choose whenever the need arised.
