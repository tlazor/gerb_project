First, you'll see some overview information, then a description, then a (possibly very long) changelog, and finally at the bottom, the file list. (Hit q when you are done with less.)
My question is: Can I now safely delete the ~/Downloads/file.rpm file or should I move it to another location on my system? Or am I supposed to forever leave it in its current directory...?
You can also use the less pager to see details about a package (it runs an RPM query command in the background), like this:
If it is of any useful information: I don't have any /var/cache/yum/ on my system and I don't have anything related to file.rpm in /var/cache/dnf/. Also, no /etc/yum.conf, /ect/dnf.conf or anything related to file.rpm in /etc/yum.repos.d/.
Once the package is installed, the various files will go into their appropriate locations on the filesystem according to Fedora's guidelines for filesystem layout. Once you've installed a downloaded package, you can remove the RPM file.
You can see where a package is going to put stuff before installing it from the command line. Let's assume your downloaded package is foo-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm, and it's in ~/Downloads. You can see what's in it by running:
I downloaded an .rpm file to my ~/Downloads directory and successfully installed it by double clicking on it: Software opened and I could click on 'Install'. Simple and very convenient, but I would like to learn more about the system and where files are (supposed to be) stored.
