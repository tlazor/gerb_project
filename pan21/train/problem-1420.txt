If the policy is instead applied to the whole domain and you can't actually log on anywhere using a domain admin account, then a possible workaround could be using the PowerShell Active Directory module: almost all cmdlets have a -credential parameter which lets you specify the credentials to use for running the command, even when PowerShell is actually running under a different user account; this includes Remove-ADGroupMember. Thus, a possible solution would be:
If it's only applied to DCs, then you can still log on to another member computer using a domain admin account; you can then enable the group policy management console and/or all other AD administrative tools if you are on a server OS, or install RSAT and do the same if it's a workstation; with those tools, you will be able to edit the offending GPO, or at least users and groups (the ADUC console uses LDAP queries, thus it's not subject to log on restrictions).
If this works, <UserName> will be removed from <GroupName>, and thus the offending policy will not lock it out anymore.
