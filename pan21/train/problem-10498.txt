Our current production environment has three ESXi virtual hosts attached to a simple iSCSI storage unit (ReadyDATA 5500). At our offsite, we have two ESXi virtual hosts connected also to iSCSI based storage unit (EMC Clarrion AX4). Our biggest challenge is that cost of storage units from EMC, NetApp and HP are very hard to quantify as we basically just require block based storage which is certified by VMware, good support in case we can not deal with a problem and parts availability for at least 5-10 years.
From my experience, StarWind Virtual SAN and HPE StoreVirtual VSA are VMware certified and provide to vSphere Cluster highly available and fault tolerant storage presenting local disks as iSCSI ones those you might be interested in. They have required SSD cache functionality and replication. Running both solutions in the lab, I can sum-up that if you need fair performance try StarWind. Due to iSER support, it utilizes the full capacity of storage performance. 
VMware Virtual SAN seems like a very cost effective option to build reliable shared storage. It also seems that the virtual SAN nodes could exceed basic storage unit by a long shot at fraction of the price and provide more flexibility. I am busy obtaining pricing for some entry level vSAN nodes from Supermicro (5TB) and will also look into what HP has to offer.
I am busy familiarising myself with the revamped and new storage options going from vShpere v5.5 to vShpere v6.5. VMware Virtual SAN is an interesting beast but would like to know how the real life perspectives are.
