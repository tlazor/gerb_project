Also, even if your equipment was all designed for, and bought in, the same country, some devices scan all the channels at boot, looking for APs in range that publish a country code IE (information element) in their beacons and probe responses, and then set their own country code and country-specific behavior to whatever country code they find in their scan. If a neighbor has an AP that publishes the wrong country code, some of your clients may be seeing that and setting their radios to that mode, where some channels are disabled. You can use a Wi-Fi scan tool that reports the country code of all discovered networks and see if you have any incorrect country code networks in range.
Overall, while troubleshooting this sort of thing, I'd definitely leave the channel set to 1, which is the most widely supported channel.
As for channel issues, channels 12, 13, and 14 aren't available in all markets. If you have client devices that were designed for a different country than your AP was designed for, your client device might not be able to find your router if you set its channel to anything greater than 11.
This usually comes down to either channel support issues (which you may have ruled out) or using a hidden (non-broadcast) SSID, which some clients had been configured to scan for (added to their preferred networks list) and others had not.
