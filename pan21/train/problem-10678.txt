If you need all the devices on the same subnet, it looks like what you want is to bridge the connections.  ICS does enable a DHCP server of sorts, it will probably assign any connected device (your VoIP phone in this case) an IP in a different subnet from your laptop's wireless card (something like 192.168.137.x), so if you want everything on the same network it would be easiest to have the DHCP server in the router assign an IP to your VoIP phone.  Which means, bridging the wired connection to the wireless.  If all you're trying to do is just get internet to the VoIP phone, then ICS might work fine as long as you have the phone and the wired adapter set to DHCP.
Unless you have specific reasons to, I'd recommend against statically assigning all those devices -- the router might be trying to give one IP while your device is trying to take another.
you can then plug another system(your VOIP for example Dev) into the laptop, and then be able to access the network across the server.
you have to bridge the two connections though. in windows, if you go the the network connections control panel, select both of the connections, then right click and choose "bridge connections"
