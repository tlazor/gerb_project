More specific: I want the raspberry pi to work without a screen, so it has to be modular to do this exact task. Load up the system, and share it's media devices to the network. We will have access to it only via SSH but since most of us working there don't even know what SSH is the system has to do everything without human interaction.
I want to have a raspberry pi as a USB hub in a windows network. Let me explain: we have about 10 windows PC's and we need to have access to USB media devices (like a usb stick, an android phone, a removable hard drive) from all of them. I can't plug the media device in a windows PC because there is a very high threat of having a virus infect our whole network -a risk we can't take. What we are doing so far is this: we have one of the PC's dual boot with linux and we share a specific usb port to the network. This often causes trouble and we also have 1 PC less to work.
What I want to do is have a raspberry pi just for this reason, up and ready to share any of the media devices that we could plug in.
And now my question: can you give me some resources and examples of this being done? Maybe a tutorial or something. I am not looking for something fancy, just point me to the correct direction, since I am not a linux and network veteran.
