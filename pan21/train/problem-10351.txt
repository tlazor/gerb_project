A third option is to use an AWS third party backup solution. These services provide a variety of backup options if you need a less hands on solution.  Yes, there is a cost; but the ROI depends on your particular business needs. 
I have a huge Oracle Enterprise Edition RDS DB in AWS, aorund 6253 GB, that I will not used for some days. Is there a way to backup the DB and restore it after some days to avoid to pay (for the period I will not use the DB) the fee per GB-month of provisioned GP2 storage. Thanks
DB Snapshots – This user-initiated backup option gets your full database stored by Amazon RDS until you delete them. It allows you to create a new DB Instance from a DB Snapshot anytime you want.
Automated Backups – This option is turned on by default. It allows point-in-time recovery for DB instance and will backup your database and transaction log. It stores both of them for a user-defined retention period. Due to this, you can restore DB instance anytime during the retention period, up to the last five minutes. You can configure the automatic backup retention period to up to 35 days.
