Try using a mobile or another device and see if you get the same issue? If the issue doesn't occur with the other device like a mobile or other laptop then you know it's specific to your toshiba device. If it follows then the issue is likely to be your router and DHCP.
I would recommend trying to first update your wireless adaptor drivers. Making sure they are compatible with the version of windows 7 you are on. They can be found here: http://www.toshiba.co.uk/support/drivers/laptops/
I have a Windows 7 laptop (a Toshiba if that makes any difference) connected by WiFi to my ISP router, everything is set up automatically (IP & DNS, DHCP enabled). Most of the time, it works just fine:
Any other suggestions? As I said, it's an intermittent problem and the only solution I have found so far is to reboot.
If the error still occurs trying configuring a static ip address to your toshiba laptop. Make sure you use the address range etc that you have when it is connected and working fine. And see if that works.
Otherwise try logging into your router and check out the DHCP settings, making a note of what they are before changing anything. Once noted, verify and make sure they are correct. Something like this should be correct:
