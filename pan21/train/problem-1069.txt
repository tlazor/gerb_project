BTW, if your web host becomes multihomed (i.e. it has multiple A records, or even an A and AAAA) then a CNAME to the real host machine is only a single record to maintain.  If you had used A records you'd need to duplicate the list over and over for each subdomain.
From a manageability perspective, the CNAME may be easier, as you'd only need to make one change instead of several to account for an IP change to the system.
From a performance perspective, it's marginally (and by "marginally", I mean "technically, but not noticeably") better to use the A records, as your DNS responses will not need to include the extra data.
If the deployment is as simple as the example that you've provided, then it honestly doesn't matter either way.
If the CNAME points to another domain for which your server is not authoritative, it can have a greater impact due to a resolver needing to make more requests to get to the result.. but in the example you've provided, the performance impact is completely negligible.
However, if you do use a CNAME, don't make it a pointer to @, make it a pointer to some other sub-domain in the zone.
If your CNAME points to @, then all those other records will (incorrectly) start to exist for your aliased subdomains too.
