If you want the second table to contain the same data as the first table, why not simply wipe the table out and replace it?
btw the primary key TransactionEntryID is a uniqueidentifier that may slow it down? (I can't change it I'm just wondering if that the issue.  
The problem is that this operation takes 13 min. to copy just 50K records and I have 16 Million records there, it would take me a week to finish that...
I have two tables with same structure I need to copy over all tables from table A to table B, the problem is that some records from table A already exist in table B so that made the Import Fail.
Remove all the rows that are in table B and not in table A. Then you could use DOTNET SQLBulkCopy to copy data from table A to table B. It is pretty fast. For 100,000 records it would take less than 10 seconds. I am writing some pseudo code here. If you want a complete working example you could go to http://technico.qnownow.com/2012/03/27/using-sql-bulk-copy-to-efficiently-load-data-from-source-db-to-destination-db/
