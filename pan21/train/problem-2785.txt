However, if you are worried about this, you might as well put the effort into copying the data into another physical drive which has additional benefits like protection of mechanical failure and such.
Not using space would give you extra chances in the event of the hard drive head scraping the surface due to it being struck.  But think about it - unless you have a method to space your data evenly sparsely around the disk, assuming you are using this data, the head is likely going to be on or near tracks that contain your data.  The days where the hard drive controllers would respond to a "park" command to "get out of the way" of data are long past.
The error correcting algorithms used by hard drives, like all other error correcting algorithms, do have a chance of failure.  There is an extremely remote but existent risk that the hard drive may have written different data than you sent it.  With capacities getting into the trillions of bytes, this chance statistically increases.
If you format the Hard Drive to its full 3TB capacity and never use more than 1TB, then yes you could potentially increase the lifespan of the Hard Drive. I say could potentially, and not definitely, b/c the Hard Drive could fail mechanically. There is not really anything you could do to prevent that from happening. However, as sectors on the platters start to get corrupted the Partition Table will remap to other sectors on the platters that are not corrupt and not being used. Using a Hard Drive to its full capacity prevents sectors from being remapped, thus allowing for loss of data. Hope this helps!  :-)
But you don't buy yourself extra protection from this by leaving space unused.  You do obtain extra protection by storing redundant data, either by using a PAR/PAR2 tool or writing the data multiple times.
