So is firewire to PCI vs PCI-E going to yield much difference in results. I have seen stats which show:
Plugging direct into the IEEE header fixed the issue but my new motherboard doesn't have any IEEE headers (an oversight on my part!).
I will be plugging in 2 Firewire devices into the firewire interface (this is for music recording and I assume quality is key as there is a lot of data transfer).
Anyway, my question is, is there any difference in speed between a firewire plugged into PCI, PCI-E and PCI-X for both firewire 400 and firewire 800?
My issue is, my firewire units 'complained' when plugged into a PCI interface and requested they go direct into the board (and I'm really sorry I can't remember the exact error message as my PC is currently in pieces).
But on the same forum they can be quoted "Pretty much the fastest protocol can't saturate a PCI's bandwidth, so you don't really need to go to PCI-E." This worries me as I've just spent a lot on a motherboard and need to get the firewire working.
