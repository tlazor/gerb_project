You could try IsoBuster, which is specialized on Data Recovery. You might have to try multiple readers and it's not Freeware, but I think the Trial can analyze at least.
I've had pretty good luck using Nero and reading at the lowest speed. What software have yout tried reading them with?
It's unfortunately very common to get a batch of faulty media.  When you originally created the disk, your recording software should have alerted you to the issues.  However not all software is created equally.
I've often seen drives/systems where writing at max speed never works.  Also, too high of a load on system resources can lead to the creation of unreadable discs.  High temperatures can lead to rapid degeneration of the data-holding part of the disc (this does not need to result in visible warping).  CDs and DVDs are no more reliable as a backup medium than a casette tape - and honestly, due to the wide availability of software, drives, and media that are a little too cough consumer-grade, they're often worse.
I have found that whenever I want recover a damaged DVD(scratched) I can usually recover it by using the slowest read speed and then copying it over to an ISO, although it takes longer I usually get the results I want.
