If all else fails, you can try burning another card, but you should be seeing something on the screen if the card is the problem.
The device powered on once and was ready to go, but it was time for dinner and googled "shutdown raspberry pi" which said to do a "shutdown -h now"
The next day plugged in the device and the red and green leds light up but don't flash or anything.  It is hooked up to my TV via HDMI.
This is probably something I've done.  New to the Raspberry, ordered it off Amazon and it arrived this weekend.  I folllowed the instructions from Norman Dunbar (http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/06/noobs-for-raspberry-pi/ which were amazing) to the letter.  This is the Raspberry PI 2 model 2.
Doing shutdown -h now will not do any permanent damage. It's a normal way to shut down, and a good idea before pulling the plug.
Just doing a shutdown -h now shuts down, but to turn back on you need to re-apply the power as a cycle, else the leds just stay lit because the board still has power.
