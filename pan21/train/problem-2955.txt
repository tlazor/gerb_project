I would like to switch our DHCP server to the Windows DC. What are the potential ramifications of a) disabling DHCP from our router and b) enabling from the Windows DC? Will all leased IPs suddenly change?
As of right now it does not seem that when our router assigns an IP to a client on our network that the DNS server is getting the heads up, so we suffer from a lot of connection issues when trying to use RDP to connect to client machines.
On our small business network, we've unfortunately got our Cisco RV220 router acting as the DHCP server, but all of our client PCs and Servers are pointing at our Windows Domain Controller running on Windows Server 2012 for DNS.
I have done this recently. The procedure I followed was to setup the DHCP server on the Win server. When all was done, i turned off the dhcp on the router and restarted the dhcp server on the win server. To test, I went to a DHCP client and did a ipconfig /renew. All was fine. The other devices picked up a new IP from the Win DHCP at next renew. If for some reason it did not work, I asked people with sufficient rights to run ipconfig /renew, all other unfortunately had to reboot. All in all, worse case, a reboot of the client is required.
