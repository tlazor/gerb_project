If by replication you mean log shipping or something like that I believe you are out of luck.  However you can certainly set up a MySQL database as a linked server and roll your own replication scheme.  Simplest is just to do periodic snapshots of all the tables using truncate and insert statements.  Add complexity as your requirements dictate.
You can use GoldenGate for MySQL and MS SQL to do this. You would simply install the GoldenGate product on each side, then proceed as for a homogeneous replication. 
Alternatively, for a "snapshot" replication, you can use a Python (or similar) script to simply connect to both data sources (using UnixODBC and FreeTDS to connect to MS SQL), loop through the tables doing SELECT on one side, for each row INSERT on the other. As MSSQL has transactions and is your target, you can start a transaction, DELETE everything from all tables, do the copy, then COMMIT and it will appear instantaneously as far as connected users on the target are concerned, there will be no inconsistencies (unless these exist on the source of course).
