You could write a script and run it on a representative sample of machines that mimicked a typical "log in, open a document or three, check a website then logout" scenario, run it in one localised area at a time (to ensure you're testing the same group of APs) and average it out and get (imo) more realistic results.
I can't help thinking this test is invalid as a test of how clients will behave in actual use, unless "everyone downloading massive files at the same time" is the actual usage scenario. And if that's the case, then performance will probably be problematic no matter what you do; this is one of the use cases where wired is better than wireless. 
As stated in my comment above I couldnâ€™t see a reasonable reason why you would want to do this unless you had a problem, and if you had a problem I would look at other troubleshooting before doing something like this. 
You have so many variables with testing this as well. Each client is going to be a different distance away from the AP. They will all be using different chipsets, (This WILL affect performance). Even if you automate this, you will get different results (very subtle) but a result from a client that has to take 2 hops to get to your server to a client that takes 4. 
If you do your proposed test and get each client to download your test file I feel that you are going to saturate your network entirely.
