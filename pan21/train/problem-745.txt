I would definitely start by checking there. If everything looks ok under the MIME types section, then it's possible you have a module that is interfering with the requests for static files (but most likely only if you have <modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests="true" /> set in your <system.webServer> section). If that's the case I would remove all modules setup in your web.config and see if you can bring up the static files, and then readd them one at a time to see which module is causing the problem. If you can't figure it out then I would suggest posting the contents of your web.config (or at least the system.web and system.webServer sections) in the question.
Under IIS, go to your web site and check the MIME Types section (see image below). Make sure you see entries in that list for .js, .css, .html, etc, and that they have the proper MIME type specified. IIS 7.5 will only serve up pages if there is a MIME type specified. By default, the MIME types for these extensions are setup in the applicationHost.config file located in C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config folder (you may have to run notepad as an Administrator to view the file). Just search for .js and you should find an entry under <mimeMap> in the <staticContent> element.
These settings can be overriden in your web.config file. If they are they will appear in the following location in the web.config:
