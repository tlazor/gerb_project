It sounds like you have "bricked" your router  (its in "recovery mode" which is not well documented for this router - the manual does not even describe blinking red, it describes sold red asa being defective - outer DLink routers have a flashing red light indicating recovery mode).  As you are asking this question in the SU forum, the answer is most likely "you need to send the router back to Dlink or just get another router".
If you are incredibly lucky, you may be able to get a working version of the firmware, statically configure your computer to an ip address of 192.168.0.2 (netmask 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.0.1), go to http://192.168.0.1 and upload the firmware through a web interface.
Also, as this device is not even listed in the DD-WRT or OpenWRT sites,  getting help from a knowledgeable community for it will be very difficult.
From a technical POV, the solution is to somehow upload good firmware on to the router.  On  a bricked router this ranges from tricky to impossible.   Depending on the exact hardware If you can find the firmware, you can sometimes open the router up and connect to a JTAG port and flash the firmware (if you have the appropriate hardware and are able to expose the JTAG port - which sometimes requires basic soldering).  This router does apparently have a serial port - which most likely is a JTAG port.    Quite frankly, for a router released 4 years ago and which costs less then US$75 to replace, its probably not worth the time or effort unless you want to do it as a learning experience
