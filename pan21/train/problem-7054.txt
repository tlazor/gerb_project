Both iTunes and WMP have a function to "manage my library files" or something similar where they can folder structure the files in the library.  IIRC (it's been a while) WMP has an option as part of that where you can change the format so you can make it be <Track>-<Title> and WMP will set about reorganising your library and the file names itself.
Being all set, go to Action -> New. Name it "Cheap Mp3 Player" or other name of your preference. Then, select "New" to add a new action. Select Action Type -> Format Value.
I've used Tag & Rename, works really well for my purposes.  It's not quite free, but it has a trial period.  I rarely pay for software programs, and I bought this one.
I have had great success with Tagscanner. It is the most powerful, but straightforward tool I've come across.
Mp3tag can handle that. I'm supposing your ID3 tags are correctly set (no missing titles, no missing track, etc).
EDIT: Just checked iTunes and it doesn't have a changeable option but the format it uses is <Track>-<Title>
