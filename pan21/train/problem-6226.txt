Please note there is no such thing as a secure piece of software. Also, just using a different media player does not protect you against all risk. All a malicious website / program would have to do is instantiate a Windows Media Player Active X control (trivial to do) and pass in the payload in order to exploit a vulnerability.
I'm not sure as far as "best security record" goes, but VLC tops my list. Version 1.0 has also been released recently and it's open source, meaning people can assist in finding vulnerabilities and collaboratively improve the software.
Foobar2000 has been my player of choice for quite a long time. Simple player, or because of its extensive plugin support, as complicated as you want it. I have never heard of any security exploits for it specifically, but if there are any known, the developers will probably address them right away.
This is slightly redundant: but if your media player isn't talking to the internet, you're closing a major attack vector. Do you really need cover art? If not, turn it off. Do you really need CD track titles? If not, turn it off. Every piece you turn off makes you a little safer.
