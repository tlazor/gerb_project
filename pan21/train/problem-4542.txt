First, how many elements are there? Each is separated by a comma, so there are however many commas there are PLUS one (because the last element has no comma following it so you have to add that one more). So if you SUBSTITUTE() "nothing at all" ( "" in the Excel world) for each comma, the length of the target string will be shorter by how many commas there are in the original string. Your formula does that. But you do the "+1" part incorrectly in it. Given the otherwise unneeded () pair around the SUBSTITUTE() function, I think you knew to put the "+1" inside them but just typed it wrong here. If you leave it outside, you have to subtract it ("-1"). Subtract the shorter length AND the 1 from the original length and you have how many elements.
Of course, if you have the string in some other cell, you can put it in the formula instead of my "1234567" and make your formula more useful!
And from the formula your research produces, I believe you are seeing answers for both and not realizing they differ so the proper formulas must also differ and then using the wrong one for your need here.
=(LEN(A2)+2-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(" "&A2&",","0","|"),"1","|"),"2","|"),"3","|"),"4","|"),"5","|"),"6","|"),"7","|"),"8","|"),"9","|")," |||||||,","")))/LEN(" |||||||,")
It looks to me as if you desire the number of times an exact, particular seven digit number appears in the target cell rather than how many numbers of whatever lengths and digits appear in the cell. (That might also be dscribed as how many "elements" are in the target cell, like one would say in "elements of an array.")
But... if you really do need to know how many times an exact seven digit string appears, precisely that and nothing more, then you need to use the same concept but slightly differently. Begin by using SUBSTITUTE() to exchange a "nothing" for the string you want to count. Subtract that from the original length. Finally, divide that difference by the length of the string you wanted to know about:  seven digits here, maybe some other length some other use some other time and place. So:
On the off chance you want to know how many EXACTLY seven digits long, no more, no less long, numbers are in P9, you can use array functions to look at each element for length and count those that are seven digits only. Kind of complicated and if you need to add looking for letters and ignoring those elements, it is more so. And... well you get the idea.
