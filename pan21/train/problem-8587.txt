If you still have the problem then you'll have to consider your capacity for digging in and running down this problem down vs seeking additional support from your OS vendor. These are the sort of problems support contracts are made to resolve. No matter which way you go, be prepared to commit weeks, not days to determine the root cause. Good luck.
I'd would be helpful to know more about how the RAID is actually configured e.g. volume, size, RAID level, stripe and chunk sizes etc, and whether you're using multipath.
At this point the array is remounted read only.  I am at a loss as to what the problem could be(I'm relatively new to dealing with Fibre Channel/RAID arrays of this type)
You're getting an error handling escalation because the aborted command isn't being handled to the satisfaction of the low level driver and the SCSI mid-layer, that's why the recovery severity keeps climbing. How it got there to begin with is going to require lots of analysis like recording blktrace. All I can recommend with this very limited information is to try and upgrade your driver using one the LTS backport kernels (Oneiric for example) and attempt to recreate the problem; The mptsas driver you're using is very old. If you look hard enough, you might be able to update just that driver using a DKMS package.
I have an Apple XServe RAID connected via fibre channel to a Dell Poweredge R610.  This server is mainly for hosting subversion repositories, and storing disk images.  In the past 6 months or so we have encountered some issues with this setup where the raid ends up being remounted read only after some errors.  It seems fine when the load is minimal, but a few days ago when copying some large disk images to it it had a bunch of errors and remounted read only.
