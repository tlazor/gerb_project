This trick was a pretty common thing to do back then, when domains were rarer and AD was a new-ish thing. Even though it isn't a very common thing to do anymore, I don't recall hearing that Microsoft had dropped or broken this workaround.
I've never seen SPNs used in any situation that did not have a full-blown Active Directory set up. IIRC, SPNs need Kerberos and Kerberos needs a domain. I suspect that the SPN lead is a red herring. Good luck.
Eleven years ago, I worked around a similar problem problem by mapping a drive letter on my workstation to the remote machine and providing my credentials on the other machine. For you, that would look something like this (from a CMD or PSH shell):
Clearly, that uses an "admin share" that you might not have access to. That wasn't a problem for me because I was a member of the Administrators group on that box. If you don't have admin access, you might have to get a public share set up (by someone with enough rights) and use that, which I believe may work even though I haven't tried it.
