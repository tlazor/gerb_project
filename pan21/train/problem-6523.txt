Until fairly recent versions all logical volumes are 'thickly' provisioned.  Even with recent versions I believe thick volumes is the default.  When I say thick, I mean that if you create a volume that is 410.24 GiB, it will take up exactly that much storage on the physical volumes, even if that logical volume is completely empty.
After verifying your backups, boot to livecd/liveusb that supports LVM.  Resize the  filesystem, then resize the logical volume.  There are many online guides about how to shrink a filesystem+logical volume so I will not repeat that here.
Unfortunately, shrinking pretty much all filesystems is an operation that must be performed offline.  Also safely resizing things is a bit tricky.  Whatever you do, first start with making and verifying you have a good backup.
Your /dev/mapper/centos-root, and /dev/centos/home seems to be extremely over-provisioned based on your current usage.  The simple answer is to shrink those filesystems, and logical volumes.  Hopefully the filesystems you have on this volumes are able to be shrunk, not all filesystems are.
Your Volume Group is full of Logical Volumes. Unless you need to create more volume groups, you don't need to do anything to free up Physical Extents.
For the future, I strongly suggest that when you create logical volumes, you use use the smallest size you actually need.  Increasing the size of volumes and filesystems is trivial and for most filesystems can be done online.  So make your lv/filesystem small, and just add more space as needed.
