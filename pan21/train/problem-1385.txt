Another option however is to deploy your own IPSec gateway into AWS - either running on the instance itself, or on another instance, you then can update the route table on your subnet to route to the off AWS subnets via this instance.  This allows you more control on the IPSec settings and behaviour - but is arguably more complex to manage compared to the native AWS service.
Assuming you are referring to the ability to connect via an IPSec based VPN to securely connect to resources that are located outside AWS.  The answer is yes.  However, the native AWS implementation of this does have some restrictions.  The first is that it is not possible to specify any aspects of the phase 1 or phase 2 configuration settings.  Instead AWS provide you with the ability to download pre-configured settings for a range of manufacturers, but also provide some good generic examples too. 
Or you can simply arrange for a system on one side to periodically send a ping - via a cron job or scheduled task.
This is true, if the tunnel drops for some reason, the AWS side cannot initiate it (this is a VERY annoying limitation if you ask me).  However there are ways around it.  Some devices support sending keep alive packets to keep the tunnel up.  For example Cisco ASA's can make use of IP SLA feature to send SLA messages accorss the tunnel to keep it up.  Extract from the sample ASA configuration:
