The fact that you have so much stuff in your calendar gives me the impression that there could indeed be some improvement in your operations.  Big companies normally organize these situations with tools more specific to what is being done, often using specialized or custom solutions.
Just use Outlook tasks then. Create a task and enable the reminder for it. This task will not appear in your calendar and you still get the reminder functionality.
Reminders are in fact the same as appointments as they represent a time that you should get to do a specified task.
Since both types of your calendar task are apparently different categories of schedules that clog up your Outlook calendar so much, you might want to use another calendar tool, or set them up in different accounts to separate the two.
I believe the only thing you can do is to create an appointment and in the "Show As" section, change it from "Busy" to "Free".  That way it won't throw flags with the "Scheduling Assistant" but you can still set a reminder.
