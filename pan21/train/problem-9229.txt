I am guessing it was a power failure. However my computer was plugged-in (and power still on) and with battery on. Could it be the Power Supply Unit?
I had this problem on my desktop PC. Turned out that the graphics card was pulling too much power in "spikes" from the PSU. So sounds like a hardware problem.
I have event log ID 41 KERNEL-POWER- (The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.) and EVENT LOG 6008 - (The previous system shutdown at 2:13:12 AM on ‎8/‎5/‎2015 was unexpected.) . 
I am running a Dell Inspiron 15 7548, Windows 8.1, Samsung SSD 850 Evo (256GB), AMD Radeon R7 M270. At the moment of shutdown only Chrome was opened playing a streaming video on a Flash plugin. Which makes me believe that it could also be the graphics card or controller. However I'm used to watching movies and series for long periods, never happened, and also a little gaming.
This is the first time this has happened. I started my computer, and 40-50 mins in, it shut off. No screen, no lights, nothing. I believe the ssd or vents still made some sound though (yes, my ssd for some reason makes a sound, specially when scrolling). I checked temp, my computer was as cool as it gets.
