Then, instead of hard coding the year into each formula, concatenate a reference to Z1 and use the INDIRECT function to convert the text string to a cell reference.  For example:
With an existing worksheet, you would need to make a one-time change to modify the cell references.  After that, you can change the year whenever you want by changing the Z1 entry.     
First, you need a year reference somewhere.  It isn't clear when or in what manner you want the year to change (automatically on January 1 of each year?  On a date of your choosing?  You want the ability to change the year at any time?).  So I'll base this on a generic solution.  Pick a cell to hold the year reference.  For my example, I'll use cell Z1 of the worksheet that contains the cell references in your example.  If you want the ability to change the year at will or on a date of your choosing, just enter in Z1 the four digit year.  If you want the year to change automatically on January 1, use =YEAR(TODAY()).
There are a few ambiguities in your question.  This answer assumes you're talking about cell references in other workbooks, as illustrated in your examples, rather than hyperlinks, and that the task is to set up the references as adjustable by year, rather than rewrite all of the formulas each year.
