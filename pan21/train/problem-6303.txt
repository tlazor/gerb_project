I've been doing some research trying to figure out the most economical yet effective way to incorporate this visual mechanic of letting individual parts of a character independently increase in size and detail and have come up somewhat short, most likely due to my complete lack of experience when it comes to art (my experience is mostly in programming).
In a nutshell, blend shapes allow you to morph (part of) a shape into another, on top of, say, bone animations. You could create two or three versions of each body part and seamlessly interpolate between them.
If you're comfortable with 3D modeling, I would recommend looking into blend shapes. They're often used for e.g. customizing faces in RPGs, and should fit your use case quite nicely.
I'm creating a game with a bodybuilding/fitness theme. The camera will almost always be focused on an inclined front view of a character who will be evolving very frequently during the game as the player 'levels up' the musculature of each part of the character such as arms, legs, chest, etc.
I was thinking 2D would be best for this game, however maybe this one character should be in 3D? Would a low poly style fit these requirements, or should I look towards something akin to sprites or hand drawings? The games interactivity will be purely through menus so that doesn't need to be taken into account when dealing with the problem of this character. I would like this character to have some animations, of course, however I'm not sure if that fits the scope of this single question.
