Suggestions for validating SVG files invariably seem to point to Xml validators that merely validate that the SVG files are well-formed Xml and conform to the SVG schema.

The resulting file is well-formed Xml and I cannot spot any obvious errors. When I try to open it with Inkscape, a message box with the message
