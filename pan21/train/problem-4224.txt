I guess it would all come down to what kind of sandboxing Android and iOS has for the apps. We are currently using react native as the mobile framework. Does anyone know if the sandboxing would prevent the ability to check emails in the background via the gmail api, pop or imap methods?
Assuming that the offering here is something that identifies and processes specific emails with some special sauce and then notifies users when certain events occur, consider instead offering users an email address on a new domain which by default forwards to theirs. Users provide your @wayofthefuture.com email in whatever places are compatible with your offering. Then deploy your polling and processing using a centralized architecture. Scaling this kind of processing is trivial and inexpensive to do with cloud services like Amazon. This model also avoids custodial and reputational risks.
My thinking is that centralized server polling would be a major problem. If the app becomes popular we would have to build necessary server infrastructure to handle the load. Additionally, if we had thousands of downloads of the app, then the server would be checking thousands of emails from 1 IP address. What are the chances that this 1 IP address could be blacklisted by a major email provider?
I am trying to figure out server architecture to run an app that is similar to a MailClient app on a mobile device. Basically, the app will need to check a persons email (gmail api, pop, or imap) in the background, then initiate a push notification on their phone. I have identified two possible architectures for this app:
