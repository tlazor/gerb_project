5 days ago I was access able to access SQL Server on my localhost machine via SSMS perfectly, no errors logging in with credentials. Now I get this error:
Here is the last log entry located in: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG
A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 2)
How can I increase my number of connections to access SQL when I can't access SSMS or SQLCmd to execute sp_configure or right click on my database and edit properties to increase the max connections allowed? Or is it another issue? Currently I have named pipes and Shared Memory Client protocols disabled, only tcp/ip is enabled. With all enabled I get the same exact error. I've tried with my firewall on and off, same issue with all client protocols enabled.
