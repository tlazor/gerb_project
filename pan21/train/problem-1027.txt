Have you considered services from Global Relay that can bundle most if not all of what you need in one solution? https://archiver.globalrelay.com/archivewebmail/archivewebmail.fpl. They provide email, social media & sms services from one console. Does having one provider simplify your life?
The answer is Forbid it.  There are gaps in every solution I've seen. You don't even own your SMS data (because the answer is to have the MO archive it for you- but they won't...). dexrex "solves" the problem by using software to keep a copy for yourself but what happens when joe salesguy wipes his android and doesn't re-install it.  You'll get notified but by that time he's already texted his buddy.  By forbiding it you've covered yourself.
For SMS archiving I'm familiar with Dexrex's software - It seemed to work pretty well and may do what you want (it basically consolidates SMS/MMS messages and emails them to a specified address -- Double Win in that your users get an email-record of their SMS conversations and you get it archived by virtue of it becoming an email.
I have tried Dexrex and TextGuard - TextGuard wins! - They have solutions for Third party IM like AIM, Google Talk, MSN and Yahoo Messenger.  Also capture BBM on the Blackberry.  They can also support IOS SMS archiving and monitoring but the phone needs to be jailbroken.  Support isn't 100% for consumers since they are mostly a compliance solution for large enterprises, but they are worth a shot.
I've got nothin' for you on IM -- the usual solution I've seen is what you've described where you route everything through a logging proxy server (which is ugly, but works as long as people don't use the applications from outside of your network...)
