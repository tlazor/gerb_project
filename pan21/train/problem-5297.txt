I am running a timer python program I made on a raspberry pi with raspbian. The idea is for the timer to start when the pi boots (systemd) and stop when the pi is unplugged. It saves to a MariaDB database at constant intervals so that when it is unplugged its state will be saved. My problem is that MariaDB is a dependency, and MariaDB doesn't start until after networking. Since dhcp takes time to start, my program doesn't get started until networking and MariaDB are started, and that takes >10 sec. 
Not sure if mariadb will run without the network but peterh's solution is basically the right way to go. On my testserver there is also a "syslog.target" in the "After=" part. Maybe you want to try removing that as well if you don't depend on logging during mariadb startup. But I don't really know how soon syslog starts so this might not speed up things significantly.
Otherwise systemd will not change the startup sequence and your changes will be ignored (unless you reboot the entire system, that works as well).
Is there a way to run MariaDB without networking on only localhost and start it before dhcp is finished?
Furthermore please be aware that when overriding the entire systemd service file like you tried you will be stuck with your version of that file. That means if mariadb updates the original /lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service your file will not be updated and you might miss important changes.
