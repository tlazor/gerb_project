We have a 4-core physical server happily running along with Win2k3, IIS6, and SQL Server 2k5. Our service provider would like us to P2V the box to ESX. We are not opposed to it, but I've gotten really comfortable with assessing performance on the physical server and feel a bit squeamish about how the virtual replacement will be configured and perform. My quesitons:
Performance should not be an issue.  I run a 300 person Exchange server on a 2 virtual CPU virtual machine with no issues.  You may find also that the VM performs just as well with less virtual CPU because for each virtual CPU you have to coordinate a physical core being read to process a tick.  The more virtual CPUs, the more cores that have to be "free".  We run most servers with 1 virtual CPU unless there is an absolute need for more.  SQL and Exchange are the only machines we run currently with 2 virtual CPU (including Citrix).
It is possible that Windows will want to reregister because every piece of hardware will change.  That's a simple thing to fix though.
The OS will think it has how ever many CPU it is assigned in ESX.  This can be 1, 2, or 4 virtual CPU.  I think in vSphere this has been raised to 8.
