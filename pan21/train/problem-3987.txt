But my take on that is that the Amps are a like a maximum load you can bruden the circuit with. What's more important in this case (with my non-electrician knowledge) is that your new UPS can deal with 120 volts. It's most likely the case quite honestly.
Even though it's been over 20 years since I worked in that field, the laws of electrical physics haven't changed.
It LIKELY is safe, but the UPS fuse LIKELY is OUTPUT - and the UPS can suck a lot more power because it msut deliver it's maximum load AND LOAD AT THE SAME TIME. The documentation (of the UPS) will have requirements for the input circuit.
I still recommend you have a electrician sort out the converter plug or cable. The cheap stuff you can buy online is often of shoddy quality. If you buy it yourself get it from a reputable source.
I don't think you will find adapters for this, I believe the point of twist type plugs is to secure the connection physically. Having an adapter would pretty much defeat the purpose.
If the voltage is the same (120v in your case) and the Amp rating is less (15 < 30 in your case), then Yes.
Just think of it this way: If it wasn't OK nobody could plug a phone charger (about 2 Amp max) in a standard wall-outlet (10 Amps or more).
