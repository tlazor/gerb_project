If you already have a second MX record to an off-site host, you're already doing the right thing. The next thing you could try is setting up redundant links with two different providers and play with BGP and the wonderful and unique world of hurt that playing with redundant links brings.
However, properly configured email servers will try again for something like 12 to 48 hours, with longer and longer windows between retry attempts rather than just dropping the email altogether.
The real question is, that for this downtime, did it affect your mail and business to the point that it justifies pursuing this route? How often do you experience outages, and how long do they typically last? If the business impact is high enough you can look at the redundancy route; otherwise maintain an offsite (with separate provider) second MX system and that should be good enough until the benefit/cost ratio dictates otherwise.
Technically you can't control what other mail servers do or if they're configured properly. Part of the problem in my experience is that people are of the mentality that email is instant messaging. It's not. It's unreliable and rickety and it's amazing that it is still usable in this day. There's nothing built in for authenticating or verifying users, it's not encrypted, and because of spammers, it's not uncommon for legit messages to get stuck in junk folders or for email servers to drop messages suspected of being spam without notifying the sender that the message wasn't truly delivered.
