that's if for the 'input file' where /dev/sda is the device label for your primary hard drive (and /dev/sda# will be the partitions) - if you don't know how to get the device label for that you can just have a look using gparted or fdisk - and of is for 'output file' and that will be the device label for your external backup drive. 
a) Clonezilla: Will it backup all partitions (EFI, recovery, Ubuntu, swap, Windows) to external drive, so I can restore it to a new drive, no problem? Which file system should the external drive have? Or if the created file is an exact clone of the drive (partitions with different file systems), is it also bootable like a live usb flash drive?
I have done backups with Clonezilla, but never restored it or opened in a virtual machine (is that possible?). So, I don't know if the backup files will actually do what I think they should. I just like to understand the cloning / backup process better, so I will actually have file that will restore my failed SSD (when it happens).
I have an Acer Aspire R laptop with 260GB SSD, UEFI, Ubuntu and Windows 10 dual boot. How can I backup / clone / image the whole drive to be reinstalled on a new drive if current drive fails? 
b) GParted: Or should I partition the external drive like the existing drive and copy the partitions with gparted?
