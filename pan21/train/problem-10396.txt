You should analyse and determine the cause of the Stack dumps, If you have support from microsoft, you can consult them and of course you can always delete them, they are nothing but memory dumps, may be generated because of memory issue, access violations, DB courruption, etc. You can also check SQL Server error log for the information or errors logged at the same time when dump was generated. Sometimes dumps are also generated because of Database corruption, So i will also suggest to run DBCC CHECKDB. 
AV Dumps - You can attempt to tackle this yourself:  https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlcat/2009/09/11/looking-deeper-into-sql-server-using-minidumps/
If you run into difficulty, open a case with Microsoft, but just as Shanky said, ensure you are on a supported version and you have the latest updates.
When I checked it, I see that there are a lot of SQLDumpxxxx.mdmp /SQLDumpxxxx.txt files in that folder.
Corruption Dumps - Just as the first answer states, run DBCC CHECKDB.  If the output from DBCC CHECKDB indicates corruption in your indexes, rebuild them.  If it indicates that "repair allow dataloss is the minimum" necessary to repair the database, then restore from last known good backup.
If the .log file indicates "Deadlocked Schedulers", this is also performance related specific to CPU.  You can troubleshoot those following the steps in this blog:  https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/karthick_pk/2010/06/22/how-to-analyze-deadlocked-schedulers-dumps/ 
The "Log" folder SIZE in the SQL server root directory (X:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log) becomes too big , ~80 GB.
