A better solution, which I haven't tried so I don't know if it will actually work, would be to use Hard Links or Junctions from the files in ~/My Music/iTunes (or the folder itself) to one central version of this folder.
This should make the current user use the shared library and database. Log into your other Windows user, and see if iTunes there opens the shared folder. If not, use the SHIFT+open trick to switch that iTunes to the shared folder as well.
The iTunes Library (the artist/album folders and the mp3 files) is located at C:/iTunes/iTunes Music/ rather than ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music. This is set within the iTunes preferences, and is done to get the username out of the path to the mp3 files.
Sharing a common iTunes Media/Music folder (and Consolidating/Organizing library) does not allow purchases on one account to show up on another.  If they all accounts are authorised to the same iTunes account files can however be added from one Windows Account iTunes instance to another (without authorisation hassles)
(I did a search and replace in the iTunes Music Library.xml file in ~/My Music/iTunes to get iTunes to recognise the move.)
The files in ~/My Music/iTunes (the database files) are synchronised between the two computers using Microsoft's SyncToy (as are the updated mp3 files and folders).
This works well for me and could form the basis of a solution for you, copying the database files back and forth from one folder as you log in and out of Windows but keeping the music files in one folder. I think that the copy commands could be done as scheduled tasks, but there may be a better way (Group Policy perhaps?).
