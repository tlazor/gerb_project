A layer 3 router is making use of MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) to switch packets in the router instead of using the routing engine. This means that the packet skips the routing engine and goes directly out a physical port.
Usually a router (in the U.S.) is connected to an ISP using a variant of PPP (specifically PPPoE). The router takes a routed protocol (TCP or UDP) and passes it to the provider network directly. Then the provider network uses a routing protocol (OSPF, IS-IS, or RIP) to route the routed protocol.
I've worked with Layer3 switches. I'm currently a Network Security Engineer at Level3. I've worked for TWTelecom and Reliance Global Com as a network engineer. Let me know if you have any other questions.
There are a couple of problems with some of the answers provided. First and foremost we have to understand what a layer 3 switch is, and what a router is.
An L3 switch is NOT just a switch and a router in one box. An L3 switch is a router runnning specific software that makes it compatible with protocols being used by other L3 switches it is connected to.
What you are attempting to do will provide no net benefit. You are essentially complicating your network... because you can.
The catch is MPLS is only useful if your provider is using it, and you have multiple networks (think 254 devices per network in 254 networks).
