Laptop computers began outselling desktop computers a few years ago so many people use them as their main work machine, sometimes hooked up to a docking station or at least a big monitor.
These people are professionals and want the latest. 64-bit OSes have now been around for years and are no longer bleeding edge. Even netbook CPUs are 64-bit now. So it looks like the manufacturers and Microsoft have decided that 64-bit is the future as of now.
Since their processors are 64 bit... why not using the right OS (64 bit)? There are many advantages of using 64 bit OS in certain conditions and most of the new laptops will comply in a very near future (or be upgraded for some older ones) while there are no advantages of using 32 bit OS so I would find strange a 64 bit machine to come with a 32 bit OS. This was done in the past because there were a lot of incompatible software and drivers for 64bit.
It seems increasingly popular for laptop manufacturers to preinstall the 64 bit version of Windows 7 on laptops. Whilst there are well understood benefits of 64 bit OS over 32 bit, how much of that is realisable on a laptop? What is the real advantage of 64 bit OS when the hardware otherwise limits performance by the capabilities of the RAM slots and hard disk data rates?
