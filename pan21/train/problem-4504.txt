If you are trying to use this to precache objects, I would take a different approach. If you are drawing three balls there is no reason to load its texture and shape three times. If your object and renderer are separate (makes life way easier) then you can just have the renderer draw the same ball in three different locations. You can take this a step further with sprites. You can load a single sprite sheet for all of the animations of an object (or multiple objects) into a texture and just draw a section of the texture each time. Each object does not need its own texture.
I am asking since the game still tends to stutter once in a while when I grab some models off the pool to ingame-runtime (although it is already ingame)
Pooling is more often used to get around memory allocation issues. If you are making a bullet-hell game then creating and destroying all of those bullets is going to be a costly operation. It would be better to create a bullet pool, and when a bullet is destroyed it is just removed from the logic and draw loops, and returned to the pool. Once it is shot again it is re-initialized and added again to the logic and draw loops.
