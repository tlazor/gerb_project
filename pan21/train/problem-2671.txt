This is not possible. Not exactly the way you describe anyway. Your router, regardless of the type of internet connection you have, has no visibility into your PSTN line, even if it is a lineshare ADSL connection into a modem/router combo. As far as that router is concerned, it is Ethernet protocol up until it hits the modem, and then it is ATM protocol up until it hits the DSLAM. The connection over the phone line is ATM and is at a much higher frequency than phone calls use. In other words, it is designed so that it does not interfere and therefore does not even know if/when the phone line is in use. This especially so if you have a dry loop for your ADSL as the phone would go through a completely different line. And again, even more so if you have a cable, or other type of connection as they aren't even using the phone lines.
You can always setup a VoIP connection with a softphone through a VoIP service, VPN into your netowrk, and run the softphone through your connection (The reason I suggest VPN with a softphone is because you never know quite what ports will be blocked on any given connection that will render your VoIP useless, but if your network is set up for it, when you VPN in, you ensure it will always work). This however might cause audio issues when latency issues occur on either connection.
