Syntax highlighting many languages in Word documents: http://www.planetb.ca/2008/11/syntax-highlight-code-in-word-documents/
I found this question looking for the same thing for Outlook on Mac OS, but Notepad++ doesn't exist for OSX and I use Sublime Text (which has the advantage of being cross-platform).
Without manually creating character styles for each element of the language and applying them manually, you can't.
You may want to consider abandoning Word altogether and use AsciiDoc instead.  AsciiDoc is both a simple markup language and a processor to render documents into other formats.  It supports HTML and DocBook.  DocBook format can be converted to other formats (e.g. PDF, ePub) using additional tools (e.g. a2x).
Your best bet is to take a screenshot in a editor that does do syntax highlighting and insert that into your document, or copy-and-paste the already colourful code from another program (perhaps a paste bin) and paste it into Word and hope that the colour formatting gets preserved.
Note that on Windows or Linux the shortcut key for the Command Palette is different, but it can be accessed by going to Tools > Command Palette.
Then to copy text you can press cmd shift P, and run "SublimeHighlight: copy to clipboard as HTML" (or RTF). These commands can also be assigned keyboard shortcuts.
