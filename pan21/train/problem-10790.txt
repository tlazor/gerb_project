I am using bind 9.9.2 as a DNSSEC validating recursive resolver in an Internet DMZ.  I want to point to my internal DNS servers as stub zones (ideally) or anything except slave zones (to avoid very large zone transfers).  We use a routable ip space for our Internal addressing.  Sorry if I am using an IP space that you own in my example, but 167.x.x.x is the first zone I found that fits my issue.
Is there a way to bypass DNSSEC validation for specific zones? Any zone that I host internally, I do not want DNSSEC validation performed on.  I have only see this interfere w/ certain reverse zones where the top level has DS/RRSIG records.
When queries hit the DNS server, they attempt at being validated, and fail because 167.in-addr.arpa HAS an RRSIG record, but sub zones do not (and should not!).  Google dns is used in this example, but in reality it would be my recursive resolver.
Set up 255.167.in-addr.arpa as an authoritative zone on your own recursive resolver; it will return answers with the AA bit set, regardless of whether a delegation exists. In fact the RFCs prohibit it from returning the AD flag for authoritative data.
I haven't figured out a good way to do this with bind, but can be done with the caching resolver "unboud". The option for unbound is domain-insecure:. Using bind the best I could come up with it signing your zone and doing dnssec-lookaside 16.172.in-addr.arpa dlv.examle.org or something of that nature.
What you are seeing is the DNSSEC records that prove that there is no delegation to 255.167.in-addr.arpa from 167.in-addr.arpa -- as the Google DNS servers see it.
