I'm attempting to add a SSL certificate from GoDaddy to my server and every time I generate CSR key and submit it to GoDaddy, I receive the following response: "You must use a fully-qualified domain name for a Premium Certificate Request."
Nothing special. Let's say your domain is example.com then everything NOT example.com is a full-qualified domain name. For example www.example.com or something.example.com is one.
What steps do I need to take to ensure my domain is full qualified? Could it also be an issue with the way my server is configured?
A fully qualified domain name means the full domain name.  For example if you were to submit a request for serverfault the Fully Qualified Domain Name would be "serverfault.com".  It simply means the full name.  If you were talking about a particular server in a domain, the FQDN would be the server name plus the domain.  For example Srv1.subdomain.domain.com, or Srv1.domain.local.  
You don't need to qualify your domain name. You need to use your fully qualified domain name. That means, you need to use the full DNS address that includes hostname, any subdomains (if their are any), domain name, and tld followed by a period. Something like this:
