I have a document titled Doc1.docx and click Save As. The File Name field shows Doc1.docx highlighted.
I realize this is semantics for most people, but working in doc ctrl, this becomes a big time sink when saving many documents throughout the day. Is there a way to force Office, or all Win7 apps for that matter, to stop showing me the extension? It's completely useless information since below that field the drop-down specifies the file extension to be saved anyway.
I work in document control and must constantly save new revisions of current documents. It becomes a burden having to click Save As, then manually highlight the .docx or .xlsx (etc) and delete when I want to add to the file name.
Now I want to revise Doc1.docx and note this revision in the file name. I must manually select the ".docx" portion of the File Name field and hit Delete, then type "-Rev1" so the file name now reads Doc1-Rev1.docx when I hit save.
In Windows 7, most notably with Office 2007 documents, when you click Save As, the application opens the Save As dialog and puts the current filename + extension in the File Name field (perhaps it only adds the file extension because I have the explorer option turned on to view all file extensions...?).
