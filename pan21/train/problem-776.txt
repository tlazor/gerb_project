You should be able to download from your provider all the certificates that form the chain of trust from you signed certificate up to the signing Certificate Authority.
But to me it's like duh, of course you can't get the local certificate - there isn't one. I don't get how I'm supposed to verify a professionally-signed certificate.
This is a professionally signed certificate from Comodo by way of DreamHost, not a self-signed certificate. How can I verify the trust chain using openssl or some other method?
You'll need to get a copy of the intermediate (most CAs will provide, or you can fetch it from an SSL connection whose trust is working), and point at it in your openssl command with -CAfile intermediate.pem.
What I'm trying to do right now is simply verify the validity of the snipsalonsoftware.com certificate so that, when I try to verify the app.snipsalonsoftware.com, I know that I'm getting a meaningful answer.
Generally what this means is that OpenSSL's default CA path doesn't contain the certificate that signed the one you're checking - usually an intermediate certificate.
You can also use an online tool like SSL-Checker which graphically shows the trust chain your server is presenting and helps you to figure out which certificates are missing in the chain
Then use openssl verify using those certs. Check both the -CAfile and the -CApath options of the verify(1) command to learn how.
