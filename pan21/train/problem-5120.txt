When the application will ultimately be deployed at the customers network, we will certainly need to troubleshoot and debug some errors that will happen, and without debug logs that will be very hard.
I only found one question on StackOverflow that inspired us to implement an Appender that calls Response.AppendToLog and the logged messaged do appear in the IIS log, but with all whitespaces replaced by "+", which makes stuff like stack traces basically unreadable.
