The chipset on the motherboard can have an effect as well when it comes to the CPU accessing resources on the motherboard.
The quoted CPU speed is the speed at which the internal clock runs.  This is faster than the external clock (the FSB clock) which determines how fast the CPU can access the resources on the motherboard.  A fast internal clock means the CPU can process faster, but a slower FSB means it takes longer to access memory and such.
The number of cores is important as well.  A 1.6GHz dual core processor has approximately twice the processing speed (in optimal circumstances) of a single core 1.6GHz processor.  This never realistically gets achieved in real life, but it is still much faster to have 2 cores than one.  It's almost like having 2 processors.
Pretty much everything in the computer has a bearing to a greater or lesser extent on the overall speed of the system.
The efficiency of the CPU itself has an effect too.  Each instruction that the CPU performs takes a certain number of clock cycles to complete.  A more efficient CPU will use less clock cycles to perform complex operations (floating point, for example) which makes the overall processing quicker.
This can be partially offset by the L1 cache (very fast memory inside the CPU itself) which can pre-fetch data from memory while the CPU is doing other things, so a larger L1 cache can yield a faster performance in certain circumstances.
