If you are experiencing latency problems when running multiple I/O operations, you will experience the same problems with chown and rm. If you have not noticed any problems when doing this, then just ignore it and run rm -rf * normally, you don't need to test it. The only test you need is to do it and find out if you can see problems. If you don't then forget about it.
You can use any sort of disk monitors while "chown"ing your files, that's how you can measure your Disk I/O load. 
Doing rm one by one with a shell script will not be faster, it will do the exact same thing rm -r would do, just wasting more CPU time running in the shell rather than the fast C of rm. There is absolutely no sane reason to do a chown -R before you delete files, their owner won't matter after they are deleted. As for commands to measure how much I/O you are using, I would recommend iotop. It will show I/O usage broken down by process.
rm does not affect disk I/O any more than any other command that needs to write to your disk. The only time I can think of when this will be a problem is if the disk in question is a network mounted drive. Large I/O operations can then indeed affect the entire network but it should make no difference whatsoever if the command you run is rm or chmod or chown or mv or whatever.
