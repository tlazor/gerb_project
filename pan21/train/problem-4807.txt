One day I hit "no space left on device", it was a surprise. Traditionally I use df instead of btrfs fi df, the tool reported 0 bytes free. I removed some expendable files, few gigabytes, then df reported about 20 GB free. I was able to add new data again. At some point df jumped from about 20 GB to 0 bytes free. After this I managed to add some more data (megabytes rather than gigabytes) until I hit "no space left".
I don't balance my SSD often though. I invoke fstrim -v … once a week or so; and only when I acknowledge it trimmed "way too little", I know it's time to balance (and trim again).
So yes, you may need to run the balancing. The scenario with fstrim probably doesn't apply to your setup, but the one with "no space left" may. Few hints:
The first device is about 1.8 TB. I have used the filesystem for few years. During the last several months the free space oscillated under 100 GB, I kept adding new files and removing some old ones.
My answer is somewhat anecdotal. I will describe two scenarios where btrfs balance was/is useful for me. In both cases the Btrfs filesystem exists on a single device. This is about home usage, still the answer may give you some clue.
See what man 8 btrfs-balance says about "making block group usage more compact" (usage filter, examples). Compare this answer, it's way more technical than my story.
This repeated several times but I had to get rid of more and more files to keep the things going. The threshold, that was 20 GB when I first observed it, grew to about 120 GB. Eventually I allegedly had 120 GB of free space but I could only write few gigabytes before hitting "no space left".
The second device is my SSD. I notice fstrim -v … can report less bytes trimmed than I expect. Only after btrfs balance start … the amount meets my expectation. Compare this question.
