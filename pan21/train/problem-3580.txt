You can modify your Audit Policy with Group Policy: Start...Run...gpedit.msc...Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Audit Policy, "Audit logon events". Check the "Success" and "Failure" check boxes. Try logging out and logging in to see some typical 540 events in your Windows Security Event Log.
Netstat shows all listening TCP and UDP connections. using the option -na is for all connections and no resolution of names or ports. 'b' option is to show the program assiciated with it. If DNS is running it may show alot of other connections so you might want to also specify TCP.
You should really be auditing logon events, whether the computer is a server or workstation. It's helpful to figure out which users are accessing your system, and to troubleshoot security related issues.
This is a tool to test Authentication on websites. It will show what authentication type is used: Kerberos, NTLM, basic, none. But it also shows other information like: SPN used, HTTP headers, decrypted NTLM and Kerberos authorization headers. And it can also show and delete your Kerberos Tickets.
Depends on the client/server that is involved.  For example, there is a web page (sorry, don't have time to search for it now) you can put on a web site that will tell you if kerberos or NTLM was used.  However I know of no way to tell what authentication method SQL server has used.  Although as has been sugegsted before, the security log may tell you.
