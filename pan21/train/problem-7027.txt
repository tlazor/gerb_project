The fact that this happens is also sucks and it pretty much the only bad thing I have to say about HP blade technology, which I otherwise think is pretty darn good.
Also be aware that at times both blades and virtual connect modules if you have them) do seem to stop communicating or somehow get out of sync with the onboard admin, and you may not be able to use them in that case. This typically does not effect the whole chassis, just one blade/VC module at a time.
The act of physically removing and reseating a blade/VC module seems to reset something in the ILO/OA/Chassis/VC that is not reset with a simple powercycle.
In my case i had changed some VLAN and IP settings, using a static IP on one blade. something messed up and i was unable to ilo to the blade. rebooting it didnt help. even thought rebooting the OA tray helpted to clean up some mess in the gui, i still was unable to ilo to the blade (even thought i was in the same vlan and subnet). Using EAIP to reset the IP didn't work since i was using a static ip on the blade ILO which has always higher priority then the EAIP. However here's what helped me: 
You can also do the re-addressing it via the onboard admin GUI in case you are not particularly familiar with HP blade infrastructure.
I have just started at a new company and I am inspecting their current server config. The HP 480c blades in a c7000 chassis aren't responding to ILO, although the chassis ILO is working fine. I have a feeling the last sysadmin configured the blades ILO as static IPs and it is not responding correctly. The servers are sitting in a datacenter and I'm hoping to be able to fix this remotely.
Is there a way that I can change the ILO static IPs for the blades remotely? If not and I do have to go onsite, how do I change the IP addresses of the ILO for the blades? (Sorry I'm not very familiar with HP servers)
Resetting the OA using the virtual button solved the issue for us. No reseating of the blades was neccesary
