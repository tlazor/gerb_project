Hopefully, am not violating the devops stackexchange ground rules with this reference to stack overflow.
As for your code, unfortunately SCMTriggerCause doesn't appear to have any properties pointing to the actual URL of the SCM source (I can't confirm this as I don't use SCM polling on my Jenkins instance).  Instead you could try something like this:
Recently, I used this code snippet (that's part of a regular groovy script located inside the 'vars/' directory) to get the project URL as set in the pipeline project config. Hope this helps.
Unfortunately I had to disable the Groovy sandbox because I ran into so many situations where methods I wanted to use in my jobs did not appear available for whitelist on the script security page.  Instead of adding a bunch of individual method calls to a whitelist or disabling the sandbox, you can also use a global shared library, since global shared libraries are automatically whitelisted in the sandbox.  (The shared library approach worked well for me at first, but eventually I ran into situations where I did not feel that the code I was writing was appropriate for a shared library, so I just disabled the sandbox as it had never provided any benefit to me anyway.  Just as a warning, disabling the sandbox is usually fine in single-tenancy situations, but not in multi-tenancy Jenkins instances.)
