Is there a way to make a file that is not readable to anyone else other than the Windows system, even if it is transferred to another Windows machine? I mean not allowing it to be opened with a text editing program if it's from a regular user.
Yes, you can create the file as Administrator, and then set its permissions to remove all permissions for all groups other than Administrator.
I can't answer about the transfer if you don't give more details about how you plan to transfer the file.
It may be difficult to tighten the permissions all the way, but you can get a ways towards the *nix scheme with setuid programs.  If you change ownership of a file to another user (disabled, no logins allowed), disable read permissions for everyone but that user, and run your program under the credentials of that user with runas, that should help protect the file from prying eyes.  There doesn't seem to be any way to do this with a non-interactive user, however, which would be a good solution to preventing interactive access to a file.
