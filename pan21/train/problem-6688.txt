I share your dislike of Explorer, but I have forced myself to get used to it because when I go to some random server it's the only file manager that is guaranteed to be there. Given that I usually get called upon to dial into servers when there's a problem they want me to fix, I rarely have time to mess around installing my favourite file manager.
The ability to copy/move files and folders can't be that bug riddled as millions of people use it without issue daily.
If you open a directory and move all the files and folders from that directory, that directory will remain.  That is by design.
For truly improved performance of moving data around, don't use the GUI at all.  Use robocopy (which is included with Windows 2008) to copy/move data around the system.  It's very powerful, and quick.  Much quicker than the GUI will ever be.
But on my own workstation (W2k8 x64) I use the good old Windows File Manager, as shipped with Windows since Windows NT 3.1. For the simple day to day file management tasks I have yet to find anything faster or more reliable. I have tried many third party file managers and they all seem to be too cluttered and/or too slow.
