You may also want to further sub-divide your network ranges by geographic location (floors, buildings).
You'll need to make an address plan that gives enough IPs for your needs. YOu probably want to split this down into "servers", "workstation", "IP telephony" and "infrastructure management" (to the extent that makes sense). Allocate subnets that are large enough for your needs, but still small enough to not cause broadcast performance issues. I don't know how noisy Windows is on broadcast, these days, but it used to be that you didn't want more larger than about a /23 (~500 machines) in a single netblock.
The reason why you wnat to plan for at least a bit of future expansion is that renumbering is time-consuming (less so if you use DHCP, though), there's at least some configuration to be done (firewalls, access lists, router interface configurations, ...)
There are a couple of ways of doing this, the first thing you wnat to do is to sit down and think about your probable addressing needs for the near and medium future (up to a ~2 year horizon is probably a good estimate for the planning you should do).
*I tried setting my computer from 192.168.1.XXX to 192.168.2.XXX, but it complained about a subnet issue. I left all the other settings the same as they were; subnet, DNS, gateway."
That's probably why it complained. If you have a 255.255.255.0 netmask (or a /24, pretty normal default for a 192.168.x.x IP), your host is 192.168.2.x and your default gateway is 192.168.1.x, the default gateway is no longer reachable.
