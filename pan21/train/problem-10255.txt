I'm suggesting both the removal and reinsertion on one line in case your keyboard is affected by the removal.
A good KVM should have a menu and/or command that can reset the USB connections.  However, the problem itself points to the fact this is not a good KVM.  Check the manufacturers website and/or manual for instructions... and hopefully a firmware update.
The issue is still caused by your KVM switch which required to do USB "re-numeration" while switching between/among systems.  Although the USB re-numeration is not physically discounted or reconnected of the shared USB devices to the connected systems, the connected systems will still response like physically removing and reconnecting the USB devices. 
Please go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch to check the difference between these two class of KVM switches.  Emulated class KVM will do the work, but only can see your wireless keyboard and mouse as "Standard keyboard and mouse".   DDM class KVM will be the best, but a little high in cost.
