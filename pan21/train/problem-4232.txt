Haven't found a good way to eliminate having to load each domain in its own zone, but using the following rndc command eliminates the concern of causing the server to fail in the event of a malformed entry.  
Have you considered an alternative to BIND?  I haven't used any yet, but there are MySQL driven alternatives with web frontends such as PowerDNS with Poweradmin.  This might make updates less error prone and risky.  PowerDNS even has a tool to convert a BIND zone file to SQL for migration.
The problem with this configuration is the large amount of time taken to load all 30,000+ domains as well as management of the domain list configuration file itself... if any errors creep into this file, the BIND server will fail to start, thereby making automation of the process a little frightening.  So I'm looking for something more efficient and potentially less error prone.
In theory you can avoid the slow load time by making your blackhole list part of your root hints file (e.g. via $INCLUDE) and then changing that file from being a hint to a master.  That last bit is necessary to prevent your server from download the real root hints from the internet.
Our current solution for this requirement is to include a file containing a zone master declaration for each blocked domain in named.conf.  Subsequently, each of these zone declarations point to the same zone file, which resolves all hosts in that domain to our honeypot servers.  ...basically this allows us to capture any "phone home" attempts by malware that may infiltrate the internal systems.
There's no real need for NS records or separate zone statements for each blackholed zone - you're effectively inserting fake authoritative data into your local copy of the root zone.  Just make sure you download the real root zone occasionally!
Currently running BIND on RHEL 5.4 and am looking for a more efficient manner of providing DNS redirection to a honeypot server for a large (30,000+) list of forbidden domains.
