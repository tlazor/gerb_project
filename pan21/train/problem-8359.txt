It does not actually encrypt your files or protect them in any way at all, it just hides them. It seems to me like you don't really need any high level security here, you just don't want people going through your personal files, so this would work great. I use this on a public computer I use at school, and it works like a charm. With the folder hidden, even if someone clicks on the dropbox app, it won't open. Other people can access your data, but it will take more work that the average guy will be willing to put into it.
After some digging around and a little bit of trial and error, I found out that the best way to lock your Dropbox folder is to install Folder Lock, put your Dropbox shared folder in it and remove the shortcut from your Favorites list in Windows Explorer (for Windows users only).
SecretSync is another option. It gives you a folder to drop things into that encrypts them before being synced by Dropbox. (Lifehacker review)
I realize this is a late addition to this post, but I figure that anyone searching for an answer will now be able to use this if they want.
Once it's locked, nobody will be able to access it, not even by clicking on the Administrator (users/yourname) shortcut.
 OR down load Hide folders http://www.altomac.com/hide_folders/ & hide the Dropbox folder if using a mac.

Either password the dropbox folder on your hard drive with Lame Secure or unsync your computer to Dropbox & work thru the browser to upload files.
