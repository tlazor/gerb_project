My only disappointment is that you get cut-off from support and software upgrades after a few years. Here is a portion of the reply from the Google Mini Team I received when inquiring about my expired license. "The technical support and hardware warranty for the Google Mini can be extended to up to a maximum of two years. Since your device is past the two year mark, you would need to purchase a new Google Mini if you wanted to be under support again."
How big is your intranet? As an alternative you could try the free MS Search Server Express which we use on our intranet (2000 employees). There are some docs on the web comparing the two. 
My company uses a Google Mini search appliance on our Intranet. It is easy to setup and customize. The OneBox Module lets you return custom search results. I use a Java servlet to return results to the OneBox Module. All things considered I would recommend the Google Mini. 
Another free alternative is IBM OmniFind Yahoo! Edition.  It works reasonably well on our intranet for I'd guess about 100,000 documents.  Fairly easy to set up and get going, but we had a few issues with network shares; web crawling was fine.
