I have a test server setup but constantly fail to get it to read AD with the test user accounts that we have in use. The only thing that we have left now and what a lot of the forums mention is that the connection between this server and the AD LDAP needs to be secure (SSL). 
As I understand it we need to implement a certificate on one of the DCs in the domain and the one that the password server would query it on port 636. Having never implemented this I am a bit concerned over what effect this would have on the reading of AD by the computers and the user accounts that are in use. 
If I implement one certificate on one server does it only affect that server or does the whole of AD become secure, do clients continue to communicate in unsecure move and it will only be the password management server that communicates in SSL.
I have scoured many articles on the internet but cannot come up with a definite answer and I'm at a halt with the implementation as I am concerned it may break something.
