The refractive index is related to the speed at which light travels through the medium, and only applies to materials which are at least partially transparent. Metals are electrically conductive, so they are opaque, so light can't travel through them at any speed, so they don't have a refractive index. 
From my understanding, the specular color usually refers to the amount of light that is reflected when the surface is lit at normal incidence, and is noted $F_0$ or $R_0$. Moreover, for non metal materials, this value is calculated from the index of refraction of the material $n$ with the formula deduced from the Fresnel equations (in which 1 is the index of refraction of air or void):
What phenomenon explains this difference? How can I calculate $F_0$ for a metal (in particular if the medium it is in contact with has an IoR different than 1, like water)?
This is why Fresnel's law doesn't apply: it's for predicting what fraction of the incoming light is reflected vs. transmitted. No light is transmitted through the material: everything that isn't absorbed is reflected, either as a specular reflection (if the surface is smooth) or as diffuse scatter (if the surface is rough).
All these values are very low; even crystals with high refractive indices like diamond ($F_0=0.17$) and moissanite ($F_0=0.21$) hardly exceed 20%. Yet most metals have $F_0$ values above 50%. Moreover, I have read multiple times that the formula mentioned above doesn't apply for metals (which can be easily confirmed by trying to use it and see completely wrong results), but I haven't found any further explanation.
Look at the refractive index of several metals. They are all complex numbers and the math does work out when you put this into the fresnel equation: you get the expected high reflectivity at all angles.
There are also subtle color shifts because the index depends on wavelength. This is actually used in rendering but it is not common. The function is sometimes named "conductor fresnel" but it's really the same fresnel equation with complex numbers.
