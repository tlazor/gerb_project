I prefer to have a single function return the range object.  Using the WorkshetFunction.Match() is far more efficient then iterating over the cells.  
I would have a dictionary that stores a sub-dictionary for each stock that stores a dictionary for each day that stores an arraylist to store the values.
You are doing twice the work by having a function to get the starting row and a second function get the last row.  Passing the starting row into the GetLastRow() function would be more efficient. 
The dataset in the image shows that you need to know the Open, High, Low, and Close for each day to create the Chart.  Considering there are over 200 K rows, I presume that you will also need to filter by stock.  If this is true then I would take a different approach.   
I did a quick mock up and it took 21 seconds to load 259,967 rows of data into the dictionaries and ArrayList and just 11 seconds to build a new Array and write it to a worksheet.  After the data has been processed, it would be a simply matter of getting the date range and updating the chart table.  Changing the stocks or chart data should take no more than 1 tenth of a second.
