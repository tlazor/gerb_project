If you want to be able to start a command without having to specify the full path, you have to include the directory in your PATH variable. You can see the current PATH with
In Windows 10 (and possibly 8?), you will see an edit window that makes it easy to add a path. In prior editions of Windows, you will see a text box edit window. Add the folder path to the end, preceded by a semi-colon: ;c:\Users\myUser\desktop\far\far.exe
For example, I want to open Far Manager using an alias, I have at first to CD into the path, which is c:\Users\myUser\desktop\far\far.exe.
I know about the set "alias=myCommand param1 param2" but the problem is I want a single command to open up the application, for example Atom and VSCode have this feature, if I type atom or code in cmd it will open up. so I want to set a single command to open up the application without having to changing the directory into it at first and then use the start command. 
Yet another option is to set the directory and program name in a program shortcut (eg far.lnk) which you can create in a directory already in your path. Such files can be called direct from cmd.
