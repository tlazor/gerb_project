Alternatively, locate a qualified Microsoft Small Business Specialist or SBS MVP in your area and seek their advice.
With SBS 2003 and issues like this your first action should be to run the Internet Connection Wizard from the management console. There's a tick box on one of the screens to allow mobile access. If and only if this fails should you try and manually modify the IIS config. SBS is quite a complex beast and attempts to make changes manually frequently cause pain.
In this situation, given that you've stated that your SBS configuration wizards don't work and that many settings have been changed outside of the standard configuration framework, you are now essentially in a disaster recovery situation. I would recommend the following courses of action:
John is right... you are setting yourself up for a world of pain by trying to manually setup OMA on SBS, and his suggestion to re-run the Internet Connection Wizard is a good one.
The first question I would have for you however is "Did this ever work"?  I can't tell from your post if it used to work and just stopped, or if you are trying to set it up for the first time and are hitting the problems that you are.  If it used to work, what changed between then and now?
