Finally after searching for hours on what to do about this I ran ssh -Tvvv -i path/file.pem user@ip and magically I had a debug connection to the instance.
I have many instances spread across zones and grouped into various load balancers.  One of the groups is an "API" utilized by various different applications for common and secure tasks.
I would like to reiterate that all converted keys are not working for sftp despite whether an ssh connection can be established.  Specifically .ppk key converted to be used in filezilla.  The same follows that the .ppk works on all other instances except the problem child... and also worked previously.
This was done from a machine at home.  I killed the connection, and connected normally.  No problems.  Connected from a server at the office with no problem.
In the API group we have one instance that uses an Elastic IP so that we can reliably use crons for tasks such as rsync etc.  Someone before my time also decided it would be a good idea to hard code this IP into various applications in typical spaghetti code if else forest fashion... long story short, very important instance.
This is output from failed connection on home machine (yesterday) attempts using ssh -v -i path/file.pem user@ip
Today I can not SSH into the instance from my machine at the office, and all converted keys do not work on this instance either (i.e. ppk keys for filezilla etc.)
Two days ago I was suddenly unable to SSH to this guy (It was created over a year ago).  The pem key works across ALL other instances, which have been around for relatively the same amount of time.
