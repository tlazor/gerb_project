But if for some reason you must use MySQL 5.5 versions, there is MySQL 5.5.51 which is the last stable version of the 5.5 branch. There is a couple of options you can try. You can use mysql_install_db to attempt to recreate the MySQL Database. Or if that does not work, you are going to have to remove the MySQL Database and then re-install your server to make it regenerate these tables.
Just to be clear, the database I am referring to is MySQL's main database that holds information about the server as well as the users etc. Not your Databases you have created.
so first, ensure every file, in /var/lib/mysql was copied over, specifically the files and directories that are not part of the databases you created. Since you are using MySQL 5.5.49, which is an old version. I reccomend in updating your server to a more stable version. Current up to date stable version is 5.7.14
Your problem is that a mysql table from the main mysql database is missing or corrupt. More likely it didn't copy over. The table in question is
Version 5.6.7 and above no longer use this table, therefore if you upgrade to this version or higher, you can just use mysql_upgrade command to upgrade your databases and it should return your server to working order.
