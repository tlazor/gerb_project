The details are fuzzy, but as it turns out the device itself was crashing on boot. I believe it had to do with uBoot generated chatter on the USB line. Essentially, uBoot polled all hardware lines (including USB) to find a bootable image. This polling should be harmless, but the firmware on our USB device couldn't handle it and crashed immediately, rendering it inoperable until a hard reset (physically unplugging the device and plugging it back in).
We did report this bug to the device manufacturer but we received no indication that the fix for the problem (that apparently only affected us) would be a priority, so we resorted to a $.50 fix.
The way we solved this was pretty creative, but worked flawlessly. We built a simple GPIO controlled relay and spliced the USB power line through this relay. Essentially, the system booted up with the relay "off", and hence no power to the USB devce. The system booted up normally, and in our startup script we simply toggled the GPIO line to activate the relay. The USB device was free to boot up normally, with no interference from uBoot.
