The primary reason to use ext4 over ext3 for a file system of that size would be that file deletion in ext4 for large files (of more then a few hundred megabytes) is made significantly faster due to the use of extents in ext4.  Deleting a large multi-gigabyte file under ext3 is an exercise in patience as it goes scurrying around to free up the blocks.  That can take up to a few minutes for larger files.  Deleting the same multi-gigabyte file in ext4 typically only takes a few seconds.
Typically, filesystem performance differs when you have 1) very small files, 2) very many files, or 3) very deep directory trees. Since neither of these criteria apply here, I expect you are not going to see a significant performance difference from filesystem. I would choose ext3 in order to be as mainstream as possible.
What's the best file system for Ubuntu 10.10 assuming the average filesize is 8-30GB with no more than 1-2 users accessing the array at any given time?
If you are using raid 5 you may want to use raid 5 +0 for big files, this uses blocks instead of bits. so raid 5 is better for smaller files and 5+0 or what is called raid 50 is better for larger files like movies, As far as the file system goes a ext4 or NTFS, Both support very large file systems and i believe ext4 is a 128bit system,  will due fine depending on the OS you are using.
