Unfortunately it seems that its not possible in newer Qt version on recent distros. Problem is described in this link for Arch, but suggested workaround is not working on Ubuntu/Debian.
Problem is, that all apps that are executed as root (via sudo) are using root settings and enviroment. 
I am developing applications in Qt5, but it requires low level hardware access and thus need to be executed as root. My target operating systems are Debian (ARM) and Ubuntu (x86).
But found workaround, that is probably much better if you want 100% static design (on all machines) in root Qt application.
Is it somehow possible to achieve this? Like executing via shell script with additional execution parameters and commands?
System availiable styles are located in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/styles/ . In my case, availiable styles are Adwaita, Breeze and Oxygen. These styles only affects style of UI elements - e.g. pushbuttons, lists, dials and so on.
To apply custom UI colors and fonts, I used custom stylesheet. I wrote my own based on this custom stylesheet intended for QtCreator
This will force app to run with completely custom specified design, no matter how local style and fonts are set up. It can be used on user and root
