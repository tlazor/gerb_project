Tor's idea of high performance is different to the general internet at large. For example I am running mine on a pretty old Intel NUC with a pretty old Intel Celeron processor and a sad amount of RAM and it caps out at about 70Mbps - because that's all that OpenSSL can push through the CPU. 70Mbps is very large for a Tor relay (maybe not an exit node). I'd imagine even a basic semi-modern small VM would be able to outpace it.
Additionally if the node goes offline for a long time, you may have to re-sit those waiting periods. My relay was offline for 3 months as I moved countries and I'm yet to see traffic return to what it used to be.
You can see what Tor believes about your relay by looking it up on their metrics page. For example, here is mine.
Essentially any new relay is "tested out" for 60+ days before it sees any real traffic. I can vouch that this is accurate as I've been running a Tor relay for about 2 years. You're unlikely to see any real traffic unless your nodes keep the same IDs each time they are restarted, and if your node cannot prove to be reliable it will likely be placed lower down in the food chain.
Safe? Sure. But you'll never see any traffic to them. There is an excellent writeup on the way Tor vets new relays and exit nodes here: The lifecycle of a new relay
