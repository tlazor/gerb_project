But it's not true for Windows. Imagine explaining to the average user the difference between a good old Windows shortcut, a symlink and directory junction/hardlink and you'll soon realize that giving such power to the masses will be opening a huge can of wriggly tech support worms.
Symlinks are actually less dangerous than hardlinks, true. I don't think the issue here is security but administrative efficiency. I think Microsoft made the right decision as it will drive sysadmin nuts when users start to create symlinks everywhere without knowing what they are doing.
Beginning with Windows Vista NTFS gained the ability to represent symbolic links to files (as opposed to directory junctions). Also the mklink utility appeared. However, non-administrative users can't create symbolic links by default. Any insights on why that may be so? I mean, what kind of damage could a user do with symlinks he can't do with hardlinks or directory junctions (both of which can be created without administrative privileges without problems)?
In Mac OS, shortcuts are symlinks. So conceptually it's less confusing, since it's been like that since the beginning. And for Linux fans, you don't need to be told what are symlinks. ;-)
