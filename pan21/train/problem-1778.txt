Assuming that there is still some thermal paste on the relevant spot, I think it might be more dangerous to apply more paste - some people suspect that the original MacBook Pro and MacBook models overheated as a result of Apple applying too much thermal paste during system assembly.
As long as the compound was soft there should not be a problem, but if it was hard and dried out, I would consider cleaning all the old compound off both surfaces using isopropyl alcohol and applying new compound sparingly to the heat sink before re-assembly
I was trying to clean my laptop, silly me I removed a thermal conductor from top of a processor *not the main one, I believe its just the south bridge), but the thermal compound got disturbed. I put it back on and tunred the machine up. I am posting from it right now, but I am afriad that I have tinkered with the factory settings.
In general, I do not think it is necessary to remove heatsinks and other non-user-replaceable components while cleaning a laptop, especially considering the risks. Since your machine is still turning on and booting properly, it is extremely unlikely that you have caused permanent damage.
