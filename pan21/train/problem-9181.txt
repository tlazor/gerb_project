Remmina and Chrome RDP only support Full screen mode and don't support multi monitor at the moment. You can install FreeRDP:
I am running a Ubuntu 14.04 System 76 laptop(laptop). Two external monitors are connected to this laptop.
where username is your username on server, server_address is server location (IP address or hostname) and server_port is port (leave empty without ":" for default port)
Two remote desktop(RDP) clients are installed on this Ubuntu laptop: Google Chrome Remote Desktop and Remmina.
