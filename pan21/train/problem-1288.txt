If all of the files aren't in their own folders, just create a new torrent in your torrent file and add each file individually and they'll all be packed into that new torrent.  You could still do this if they were in their own folders but it's a little less organized more or less.  Don't delete any of your previous .torrent files or change the locations of any of the files or else you'll screw up your previous seeds.
In answer to your question, no you can't do what you're wanting (seed both individual files and the whole thing), not without having a .torrent file for each individual episode and a .torrent file for the whole thing.  Keep in mind if you make a torrent with the whole season users can pick and choose which eps they want so in a way it kind of is solving your problem.
One way would be to create a new torrent with all the episodes, but you would lose all the seeds from the current torrents, and you also couldn't seed people that want to download single episodes.
Let's say you have all the episodes of FOO series that you downloaded as they were out, so you have like 20 torrents. Now let's say you want to make a bundle torrent with all the files, call it "FOO Season 1", and then send it to someone.
