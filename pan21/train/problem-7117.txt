Do everything you can and as long as the computer actually powers off for hibernation (if not, there is a reg switch you can check*) PULL THE PLUG / BATTERY.

If you forget to replug it - some LED's may still flash from the clock battery or some other embedded power. Remember to check the plug first thing if lights flash weird.
Also sometimes having a boot-device plugged in during reboot or wake-up can also cause temporary cog-dis (any USB memory device, or a cell phone.)
Same problem happened to me. I tried pretty much all the suggestions above and ones from other websites. The cause was not waketimers, network, or HID devices accidentally waking the computer. It turned out to be the USB ports at the back of my computer. I had my wireless mouse/keyboard USB dongle plugged into a slot on at the back of my computer. The computer would wake every 30seconds to a minute after going to sleep. I moved the adapter to the front ports and now the computer does not automatically wake after going to sleep. Hope this information helps someone.
