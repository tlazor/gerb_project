Also, if it makes sense for you to use it, I would seriously try cwRsync, but getting it set up correctly can be overwhelming.
I am in the process of investigating solutions to this problem, and disagree with the dropbox solution. If you have your desktop and laptop and NAS all on the same LAN, why would you upload your pictures over your relatively lower speed internet connection, when all 3 destinations are connected via the LAN that is orders of magnitude faster? I use dropbox for other things, but not this. The best alternative that keeps everything local that I have found so far is SyncToy from Microsoft, but that obviously will not work on my Linux desktop.
If you are comforterable with the command line, scheduling, etc. you can easily do this by syncing files with the NAS which will in turn keep both computers up to date as well. Use SyncToy, Rsync, or a number of other command line enabled syncing tools.
Only problem I can foresee, which is usually the big one when talking about sync, is what will happen if there's a conflict?  This is why Dropbox is so great, because it creates a copy and lets you sort it out later.  Most other sync software will overwrite.  Try not to think of that as a single case scenario, but rather one that will potentially go un-noticed over a long period of time.  Next thing you know, your library is totally screwed up.
Pay for how much storage you need on dropbox and your problems will be solved. not only will you have all your photos but they will be backed up on dropbox servers.
