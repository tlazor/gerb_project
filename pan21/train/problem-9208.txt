So when I am doing something like calculating a file integrity hash, converting a video, compressing some files etc. why does my CPU not reach 100% usage, instead it happily jumps around from 0% to 15%. Now I appreciate that other things are going on and Window's scheduler cannot allocate 100% CPU to any one task, and some tasks are limited by other factors, such as waiting on the hard disk, network connection etc. and some tasks aren't suited to using all my CPU cores, is this poor coding (on application or OS)?. But instead of wasting these CPU cycles cant such tasks be sped up? I have an i7 Processor by the way, but am asking this question in general, rather than specific to my CPU. 
Also why would my CPU ever be at 0% usage? Its always doing something right, or is this a rounding thing - as reported by Windows task manager. 
I also have an i7, and my experience is that our CPUs are almost never the bottleneck; in the vast majority of applications you'll hit limits associated with the speed of your disks, RAM capacity, or graphics processor prior to hitting the limits of your processor.
I will add that if you've got a particular app that you feel really should be using more cores than it is, you may wish to consult your documentation to make sure you're using it in the most effective fashion.
For instance, if you want to use the 7-zip file archiver application and make sure you use as many cores as possible for large jobs, you'd want to make sure you use the lzma2 algorithm when possible.
