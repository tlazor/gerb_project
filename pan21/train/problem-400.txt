A storage controller as you are describing is a PCI or PCIe device, so the maximum number, type, and firmware behavior of the PCI/e in devices your system will control the maximum number of drives you can use with your system.  The other physical limiting factor will be the power supply you'll need to power each drive.
PCI/e devices hook into the BIOS via an option ROM.  On some BIOSes/firmwares you can tell the BIOS/firmware to ignore any or specific option ROMs on boot, you may need to do this with multiple storage cards if problems arise.
The motherboard chipset will have a built-in storage controller into it, or allow access to one on a motherboard, but internally it looks and works like a PCI/PCIe device, so it's nothing you really need to configure other than boot options in the BIOS.
Other than that the BIOS/firmware won't care.  This is not to say you won't encounter a buggy BIOS or firmware that has issues where it shouldn't.  Good luck.
Just a brief look on newegg.com I'm seeing X1 PCIe cards with 4 SATA ports.  So assuming your system has 4 PCIe slots and integrated video, you're looking at 16 drives plus whatever ports your motherboard has.  I don't know how "port multipliers" work but supposedly you can use them on compatible cards to split one port among 15 drives, splitting the SATA bandwidth amongst them if you wanted to get really crazy.
