As the updated question says, there's a post about this on "You had me at EHLO," so I guess it's official:
So, you may have dodged a bullet, but maybe you should have someone you trust change your administrative passwords and forget to tell you what they are.  :)
I don't understand why a company would put an official-seeming site at a completely unrelated domain.  I remember Network Solutions and maybe Register.com used to register domains like "domain-renewal.com" and they'd try to have you conduct business there.  Luckily they stopped doing that.  
Ummm, are you 100% sure? I'm not sure if I'm going to be giving out my entire exchange username and password that it asks for. Maybe I'm paranoid but I don't 100% trust it.
I don't care that it does have the word "microsoft" in there, it just doesn't look like a Microsoft site to me.
A WHOIS search seems to indicate that the domain name belongs to Microsoft and is registered through "Corporate Domains, Inc."  The DNS hosting is done by Microsoft servers, as well.
