But it is not clear to me if, when I switch on both the 2.4Ghz wifi network and the 5 Ghz network, how I should use it on my laptop?
If you go to your adapter properties your will have an option to set it to 2.4 Ghz (802.11b.g) or 5 GHz (802.11a). 802.11b is slower and older technology. I wouldn't use it. 802.11g is faster but has only 11 channels. You can only use 1,6 and 11 which the same proximity. Most Wifi uses this so you have to check to interference from other Wifi devices. It however spreads a little bit further than 802.11a. 802.11a has 15 channels.
This is not technically an answer to the question asked, but a clarification to counter some of the misinformation here.  The frequency of the signal (2.4 vs 5 GHZ) and the wifi standard (802.11 B vs G vs N) are two different things.  While you are more likely to find 5 GHZ and 802.11N together because both are more recent capabilities of later model routers, those same routers are generally capable also of broadcasting 802.11 B/G, and 802.11N can run at either 2.4 or 5 GHZ (or both on a dual-band router).
I can only use one wifi network at the same time? Do I need some special kind of wifi network card? (I have an old ibm t-60 notebook).
