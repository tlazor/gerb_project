You shouldn't need the key.  Provided this is a legal copy of the software, the product key was typed in when the OEM installed it.  When you call Microsoft to activate by phone, they will ask you for a challenge code which Office will give to you (they will show you how to get it).  They will then provide you a response code to type back in for the activation process.  The product will then be activated without needing the key or an internet connection.
It triggered a reactivation because, as far as Office is concerned, it's on a different computer.  Microsoft's Software Protection Platform (SPP) uses a number of metrics to determine whether or not the product has been moved to a different computer.  Unfortunately, the Operating System version is one of those metrics.
If you had an internet connection that it could've activated over, it would have just done it automatically without prompting you.  But because of your proxy, it can't and it's been 28 days since the SPP was "tripped" (probably from the point where you ran it the first time after the upgrade).
