You might try using a diffrent print driver such as a PCL 6, PCL 5, or a PostScript print driver to see if you get the same results.  HP should have several diffrent drivers if you go to this link(http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html) and type in the model of the printer.
i had 2 configured ports for one Label printer (I re-craetedthe view, with some mspaint magic :P) This issue was on more than 5 desktops, so something to do with a Win7 Enteprise x64 image that we use ... but... onwards
I had a similar issue just last week, labels being printed just vanished form the print list, and then nothing, printer itself is working, calibrated etc.
Solution : if you see this issue, delete the local port (how?), by changing the printers default port to LPT1-3, click Apply, then choose USB00* Local Port ( click once ), and then press DELETE should remove the secondary un-needed port.
The fact that it does print the test page only, reminds me of a problem I've faced before. However, it should not be this way normally. Go to Device and Printers and right-click the printer driver, choose printer properties, under security tab, make sure your user (and Yes specifically your user account, not for example Everyone, or Administrators, if you're a member) has all the permissions checked as Allow (i.e Print, Manage Documents, Manage Printer). If it's not there, add your user account and allow full control.
Printers do sometimes get stuck in funny modes, where nothing seems to fix it. With issues like that I would try a full reset on the printer. On the F380, that's done as follows:
Press Apply again, just to be safe, Reboot PC, check again, if the problems does not persist, and try printing :)
