I know that last year GlobalSign was updating their certificates as we were updating our code-signing certificates, so I had to add their new chain to those, too.
Describing CA using the .CRT file format instead of a raw public key .PEM allows to bundle more details in it - e.g. CA name - (yet again, the signature is worthless)
As a note on this one, SOME CAs have already been updating their root and intermediate certificates to SHA256 anyway.  
The only case where this matters, is if the root is signed by SHA-1 it can be revoked by SHA-1. That is, somebody who can attack SHA-1 can construct a revocation for the root. And I'm absolutely sure the browser doesn't know how to persist that so the vandal has accomplished no more than dropping SSL connections. How lame.
For root CA, you give you trust to the public key of the CA -bundled in the CRT -  regardless its self signature.
At the end of the day, a root certificate is self-signed. It is never signed by another entity except itself. The root certificate gets its trust through out-of-band processes like submitting it to a browsers list of trusted publishers, or getting it accepted by Microsoft for insertion into the default list of Windows trusted publishers.
You can check which specific certificates got updated and which ones they updated but also left a legacy SHA1 certificate for here => 1
These certificates (and the companies that self-signed them) are (allegedly, hopefully) thoroughly vetted through other means than just their signatures.
