Is this something that the programmer of the application has to add support for? Or are there possibly some hacks that could let me build my own support? I am running Windows 7, incidentally.
I had a similar problem with horizontal scrolling in PDF-XChange-Viewer. "Horizontal scroll" did not work, and Zoom in/Out did not work either. The later did exactly what it said: zooming in and out. 
Hold Ctrl + Vertical Scroll. That offers more sensitivity and a smoother scrolling experience, SSMS in particular. 
Open up your Logitech Options software and from the "Mouse" panel, click the white circle over the Thumb Wheel Scroll. This will bring up behavior options. Inexplicably, changing the behavior to "Zoom In/Out" seems to fix this horizontal scrolling issue (at least, I can confirm this for SSMS.) 
Other applications (like SQL Server Management Studio, aka SSMS) don't appear to recognize the horizontal scroll. In this example SSMS has a "results" pane for the results of a query, which has a horizontal scrollbar, but the horizontal scroll wheel doesn't move it.
I have a mouse with a horizontal scroll wheel (the MX Master by Logitech), but the horizontal scrolling is only recognized by some applications (e.g. Excel and Chrome). 
Try this out for other applications -- if your horizontal scrolling breaks, elsewhere, try using the Application Specific settings to only change the behavior in your desired application.
