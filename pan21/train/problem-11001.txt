The usual route is as @PersonalNexus says - DHCP - which can auto-assign them in such a way that you do not get conflicts. This is the simplest for a large network, in fact for very large networks it is the only practical solution.
An alternative, which is very messy (and one I would not recommend), is to have each device on a separate network (and actually run networks to each patch point) - this, however, requires you to set up the router/switch to cope with multiple LANs or VLANs using the same network space so requiring every one to be NAT'ed.
If you are manually assigning IP addresses for devices that are on the same network, it is up to you to ensure they do not conflict.
With certain switches you can restrict exactly what ip addresses are allowed on each port. For example, on a Cisco you could do:
What this means is that the only ip address allowed to be on the device on Fa0/1 is 192.0.2.1. If the user tries adding other ip address, they'll get no where.
If you are haven't had experience managing network conflicts I would suggest configuring a switch to do this may be exceptionally difficult.
There is no real way to block users from assigning themselfs IPs by random ( = risk a colliding IP) but to restrict them from assigning the IPs themself - aka by the admin's own hand or by DHCP.
If the network is a little larger it might be a good idea to seperate into client and server vlans with some routing (L3-Switch) in between - so at least the precious servers are safe from these coliding IPs. - but no need for a vlan for each server - just one vlan where only the admin can change things and no user has physical access and just plug in their laptops...
