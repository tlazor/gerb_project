Hilarity ensued when one telecom guy had a misdemeanor in another state umpteen years ago, which would have been classified as a felony in our state. They wouldn't even let him into the building. So he went and had the misdemeanor expunged from the record (he was a minor at the time IIRC, and that state allowed that) and had his background check re-ran, which came back clean this time. They let him in the building after that, but they always gave him the hairy eyeball. Even years later. It was strange.
We're highly trusted enough that even the suspicion of evil is enough to lose our jobs. Proof, smoof; if someone accuses us of unlawful or even deeply unethical behavior we'll be depriviledged until the matter is resolved. Period. 
I had it done at this job. While we are higher ed, we do get the occasional under-18 and are state-funded employees with the keys to the financial kingdom.
I have been, both here and at my previous employer. As part of the Active Directory roll out at the old job, we integrated a law enforcement agency into the tree. As a precondition for joining they mandated that all Enterprise and Domain administrators had to pass their background check. Frankly, I was amazed they allowed themselves to be joined that way and didn't insist on complete isolation. It certainly made MY life easier that they decided to be friendly.
