It's a broad question but let me see if I can help you a bit. Your ISP provides you with public address that you use to go out to the Internet. So if you are no staying with one of your ISPs and getting a new one there's a few changes you will have to make. For the servers (Production) you have to reconfigure the switch where you connect your servers and the IP addresses since you assign them manually. For the office you would have to change the routing interface configuration on the layer 3 switch (I guess) and conserve the DHCP configuration because it's a private LAN. If that doesn't clarify your question, please provide more details to narrow down the scenario or feel free to ask more questions. 
I'm going to assume that all the IPs you're talking about are internal rather than the public IPs provided on the ISP WAN. With luck for simplicity, you have everything on a single Class C subnet (netmask of 255.255.255.0 AKA CIDR /24).
Tom has the gist of it. This is going to be a huge mess for you without networking or Cisco IOS experience. That being said, here's an attempt at an answer:
You have DHCP server already I assume, you'll need to carve up the DHCP server by either shrinking the range it services to only cover some of the subnet (e.g. from x.x.x.2 to x.x.x.127) and use the rest manually OR cover the whole range and create exceptions inside of the range (e.g. x.x.x.3 is blocked from being given out by DHCP). Once you've done this, the servers can be statically assigned to the IPs you want without fear that another machine will get assigned the same IP.
Alternatively, you can set the 'static' IPs in DHCP with reservations. That means they'll always get the same IP from DHCP every time. This is a bit more dangerous, especially if they are Active Directory servers, exchange servers, etc.
