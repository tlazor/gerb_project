If you close the Find dialog, you can use Ctrl + PgDn to search for the next occurrence or Ctrl + PgUp to search for the previous one. This is very handy when repeating searches to make multiple edits.
Don't forget to clear the format selection the next time you search (click No Formatting in the Find dialog) or you'll only be searching within the text that has a particular style. This is also useful, but often not what you want.
I agree with Sergio Acosta. There doesn't seem to be any way to scroll through the selected instances.
When I have multiple selections in a Word 2007 document, such as after selecting all instances of a style, how can I move from one selection to the next? When you issue the select all instances command, the view snaps to the next instance of the style, but how can I find the other instances? Any cursor key will unselect everything. Using the mouse to scroll through the document is not feasible for large documents, plus the selection could be a single character -- very easy to miss!
