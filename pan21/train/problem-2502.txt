I'm kinda cross-posting this to all the UPS questions on this Stack Exchange because I was looking for something similar, and could never find any answers I liked, so I ended up researching it myself. You can use a standard, off-the-shelf UPS, and the Network UPS Tools (NUT) package to allow a Pi to shut itself down when the power goes out. I have just posted an article I wrote with step-by-step instructions for setting it up:
The LiPo Rider Pro was meant for solar applications, but the USB port can also charge the battery, so you don't really need a panel.  Coupled with a larger LiPo battery, it should keep the Raspberry Pi alive for a number of hours.  
Also, with sufficient changes and safety circuits, lithium rechargeable cells can be float charged. In this case it is best to use a single cell and a boost converter so that balancing circuits are not required. Here is some info on float charging lithium cells:
Any external USB battery pack with built in overcharging protection will help your Pi survive power outage. It will simply work as a poor man UPS for your Pi.
Of course, if what you were really after was a DIY hardware project, then I'm afraid this doesn't involve any soldering.
