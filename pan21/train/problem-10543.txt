Why would you need to work the three monitors with a laptop?  Surely the monitors aren't easily portable.  Is it just cost? If so, bite the bullet and buy a small tower and three video cards.
You could probably get decent performance if you picked up an ExpressCard-to-USB adpater. Otherwise, I wouldn't try more than a single display via USB.
I have used four of these on a single laptop and not had any performance issues. (This was a Thinkpad W510 with 16GB of RAM so your mileage may vary...I've done two and three on lesser machines and/or through docking stations though) The max throughput of the USB bus is indeed way less than these could theoretically push but they don't have any hardware acceleration anyway, so it's largely a moot point since DisplayLink has written their driver pretty well.
Also, USB 3.0 adapters will be coming out soon and they can push more bandwidth than you'll need over the bus anytime soon.
USB 2 has a maximum theoretical throughput of 60MB/s, one monitor at 1920*1200 at, say, 24 bit (Let's assume the alpha channel is precomputed, it probably is) is 6.6MB, give or take a few decimal places. One monitor at a refresh rate of 60Hz is 395.5MB/s. 3 of those is about 1200MB a second, or over a GB of data. I'm not sure if you can send only the changed parts and have the monitor construct the proper image, but even if you can, one monitor with full screen video is still well above USB2's bandwidth. USB 3.0 is much higher, but still not 1GB/s. I'm not sure how this'll work out for you, but even in a best-case scenario where you're getting maximum throughput and you're only sending the diff, I can't see you getting anywhere near decent performance.
