Imagine buying a dedicate server to host a website, but you don't have the domain name setup nor do you have any files on the server. You are still going to pay for that server even if someone cannot access it.
If you were just testing Azure and doing integration tests, they SHOULD have a feature that says, "Deploy my application for 24 hours then delete it". That way you never have to worry about leaving something deployed on accident.
No where in there does it say stopping/starting. Also deployed does not mean running. You can deploy software and not run it. 
I also want to add that the reason they may want to dedicate CPU's to your deployed application is to provide more predictability in your processing. Imagine if it did NOT take a CPU for your deployment but rather clustered a 'lot' of cpu's across many deployments. Your deployment is idle, then a sudden influx of computations occur. This will require the CPU's to take away processing power from other deployments to satisfy your computations.
While I don't think this belongs on SO, it appears very clear to me with this line developers will want to **remove** the compute instances that are not being used to minimize compute hour billing
