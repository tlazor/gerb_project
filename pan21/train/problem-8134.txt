I have completely dusted the inside of the machine, the heat fins, and the fan.  I have also reseated the processor after cleaning it and reapplying more thermal paste.
It may just be increased load during normal usage... You might try installing something like SpeedFan to either confirm or rule out the thermal issue.  It could also provide some additional insight as to what else might be causing it, if it's not a thermal issue.
Cabled between the fan and the motherboard and provides an external knob you can dial up and down the fan speed with.  Probably will circumvent the natural fan control from the motherboard/OS and give you control over the fan speed.
My company has several Gateway E2300's, the slim desktops.  One of the machines in particular may be having a thermal issue.  THe symptoms are:  at seemingly random times throughout the day the fan speed will increase for anywhere from 5-15 minutes making it impossible to work because of the "Darth Vader-like" noise (thats how the end user described it).  
This specific machine isnt running any unique software that would make it get hot and it isnt sitting in direct sunlight.
