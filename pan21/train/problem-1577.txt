If I conenct using OWA, and his Outlook client is shut down, the mail stays. (As soon as he fires up Outlook the mail disappears, however.)
perhaps there is a Xerox extension installed in Outlook.  Check for Add-ins and COM add-ins (File, Options, Add-ins)
I set Outlook to move every new email from the Exchange server to my computer (i.e., in a local PST file). When I upgraded from Outlook 2007 to 2010 my rules were not listed in my E-Mail Rules tab anymore, but I know they were hidden somewhere, as my emails were still being classified and filtered as before.
This pretty much says it's something Outlook related, but I'm stumped for where else to look. Is there a way of viewing any "hidden" rules, or somewhere else I should check?
I have a user who has somehow managed to set up some kind of "hidden rule". If he receives a mail with the subject "Scanned from a Xerox multifunction device" the mail never reaches his inbox.
I ran the outlook.exe  /cleanrules /cleanserverrules as suggested by Bart and the old rules were gone, but when I added new ones they weren't shown either... darn.
