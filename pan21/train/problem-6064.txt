There really appears a lack of differentiating factors. The only 'major' factor I found, which doesn't apply to me though, is that the R510 can hold up to 12 3.5in HDDs while the R710 (which is slightly more expensive) can only hold up to 6 3.5in HDDs.
Maybe you guys have some input and bought either of these machines (or both) to shed some light on other differences and why someone should choose one over the other as the pricing is pretty much the same with my configuration.
http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/per510/en/HOM/PDF/510en.pdf p114.  It's a triple channel system.  The part I'm still uncertain on is how they say channel 0 can have two modules while 1 and 2 can only have one.  If all 4 per CPU are populated, I'm still not sure if it's a special dual channel mode (combining channels 1 and 2) or a special unbalanced triple (as channel 0 won't match 1 or 2).
the Dell R510 and R710 can both hold regular configurations (e.g. X5650, 24 GB RAM, etc.) and these usually come out to about the same price.
