The VPN is interested only in that for anything else, because it substitutes to your local router the (remote) VPN server you have contacted. All packets coming out of your pc now appeared destined to the remote VPN server, so that your local router lets them through. Once they reach the remote VPN server, the packets are decrypted, their final destination is brought to light, and they are routed for their intended final destination.
You see from this layman's description that a VPN is simply not interested in your local communications, which are  neither encrypted nor routed through the remote server. In other words, your local traffic is totally unaffected: if you were in a VLAN you remain in a VLAN, if you were in just a LAN you remain in a LAN. 
VPNs are often misunderstood, but they are quite simple. Apart from the encryption of the communication, what they do is to alter your routing table, i.e. the locally available instructions for routing correctly your communication packets toward their final destination. 
Normally, you have a local router, in your LAN. Also, you have a local connection (to your LAN) which does not require a router at all. Your routing table basically says: if you want to contact someone local, try it directly without passing through the router. For anything else, go through the router.
