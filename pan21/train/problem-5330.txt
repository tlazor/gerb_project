So this is where I am at right now. I have attempted to google this issue however without much luck. 
Now these two NPC's wish to fight each other. They need to make sure that they stay within the reach of their weapons while also making sure that they don't bump into each other.
I would try using springs - for each of the two characters a compression spring representing "defensivness", and an extension spring representing "aggression".
This sadly causes the agents to bug out in a way where they are never close enough to attack each other resulting in something that looks like this: 
Summing up the forces for each character (for more units force vectors) gives direction in which the character should move. The force magnitude could probably somehow be mapped to speed.
The stiffness of the springs could vary over time (using some noise function), or be fixed per character to represent his fighting style. Combination of both should probably work best.
Again sort of same behavior, however, this time they just kept their distance and if the other agent came to close they would start moving backward. Which basically meant that they would move back to the end of the world. 
The force generated by the spring is calculated as F=kx, where x says how much is the loose end of the spring displaced from its relaxed position, k is the stiffness of the spring - the sign depends on type of the spring (compression/extension).
