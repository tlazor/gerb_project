I have seen this exact error before with no errors in the event log.  Completely puzzled for some time I did the following
After rebooting the machine I found that the old problematic site still didn't work but the new site did.
With more than a little trepidation and after backing everything up, I un-installed IIS 6 and re-installed it  -  the configurations for about 30 websites on the server came back, but the problem went away, and the errors stopped appearing in the logs.  From what you say and what I found, it was definitely something gone astray in IIS.  Thanks for the closure.
This may not be your exact problem but something I had found specifically on Windows 2003 with IIS very similar to your issues.  
Just because the server is pinging doesn't mean that the requisite services are.  (That just indicates that the server is running and the network stack is working.)
Have you verified that IIS (which covers WWW and FTP) is running, as well as your SMTP service?  You mention the IIS errors but don't mention whether those errors have stopped the service or not.
Turns out it was some IIS problem where it was detecting port 80 was in use when it wasn't, and IIS would try to listen on the port and fail.  Or similarly there was an unused SSL port assigned to the site that wasn't needed that caused some issues and removing it/defining the ip settings on the sites cleared up the issue.
Created a new site in IIS and left it under default config on a new IP on the machine.  No SSL either.  Just a blank page that says if it is working or not.
Welcome to pool hell.  If the application pool responsible for your sites isn't running... your site won't run.  As far as the default site goes, you probably need to configure it to run the php extensions.  If you don't really need the default site, you might simply need to stop it & start the correct sites.  I've seen similar situations where 2 sites are configured to both accept all server names on the same port/ip.
