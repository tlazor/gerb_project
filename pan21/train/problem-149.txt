I'm not sure what to tell you about the jQuery plugins not working. I'd start by looking for 404 errors in your Chrome console, then carefully examine the paths. Confirm that the files are still on the server where you think they should be. Is php adding the javascript dynamically to the page, or are the paths hardcoded in? Tell me more and I'll provide a better answer on the second part of your question :-)
I'm getting this error on all my pages and I'm not sure what it could be. I took out some code bit by bit to see if there is something in the code stopping it but nothing worked so I'm thinking its a server issue. Now, yesterday I had to downgrade php to 5.3.2 to get a package installed (php5-sybase) and this caused arrays such as $array = []; to not work so then I upgraded it today to 5.4.2 and everything was working fine except for this console error.
I looked at the Apache error log but I'm not experienced enough to see something wrong. Most of whats in there from today are regular PHP errors when I was attempting a connecting to a MS SQL server.
