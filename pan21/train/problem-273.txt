Your application is probably not aware that TCP is a stream- and not packet-based protocol. There is no guarantee, that you get header and body together in a single packet, there is even no guarantee that you get the whole header inside a single packet. 
Apart from that, the response contains to major parts: the content and information about the content (type, length, last changed...). There are several ways to distinguish between these parts and of is to split it into a header containing the meta information and the body containing the content.
When client requests a resource then server response is split in 2 parts: first part (after decryption) contains only HTTP headers (besides other): and Second part contains the body message.The most important thing: this first part containing only headers is sent with PSH flag which causes that my application throws an exception because Content-Length is > 0 but there is no body message. The last packet of the second part does not have PSH flag.
