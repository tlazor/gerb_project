Download this and install. If you don't know how to install, just google "how to install drivers manually".. I solved the same issue after searching for hours.. 
Of course if this is a home PC and it has a PCIe slot I'd highly suggest you buy the cheapest ATI 4xxx or 5xxx card you can and use it instead of the Intel graphics.
I'm guessing on the restart a file got corrupted or plug and play decided a different driver was more appropriate for your "video card".

At this point a 4350 costs about $35 and a 5450 costs about $45. Either one would be a huge step up from 945G integrated graphics.
If the resolution doesn't show the video driver needs to be updated or reinstalled. Older drivers will not offer 16:10 resolutions.
If your PC is a Dell go to support.dell.com and download the graphics driver for your PC (same goes for HP or any other big name PC). If you have no other option you can try http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/graphics/intel945g and work your way to downloading a driver.
and as always the h/w guys at the office are of no help.. they start blurting out their theories that this the best resolution... even though  i show them that the max resolution
