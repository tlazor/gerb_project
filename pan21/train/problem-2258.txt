The only thing you can do is try them all, one at a time, and see which ones are accepted. I am not aware of a tool to do this, though it should not be hard to cobble one together from scripting tools and openssl s_client.
Nmap's ssl-enum-ciphers script can list the supported ciphers and SSL/TLS versions, as well as the supported compressors.
By default, it only supports AUTH SSL on FTP, but a simple search and replace can fix that. As a bonus, it also claims to support SMTP with STARTTLS and RDP.
While the client advertises which ciphersuites it will accept, the server simply picks one and uses it or fails the connection if it finds nothing it likes.
While looking for something that does AUTH TLS on FTP, I discovered this tool: ssl-cipher-suite-enum
It also offers a basic evaluation of offered ciphers and protocols. Itâ€™s somewhat like SSL Labs tools, only for home use. :)
It's similar to what SSL Lab's does but I find that having a command line tool that you can automate and parse is much more useful.
