I've compared the old config and new config and there were a few object/service type syntax changes which were updated prior to loading the new config.  I did not notice any failed commands when the new configs were loaded.
The trusted rule should allow Host A to talk to the web server on port 443 and also allow the return traffic for that session through the firewall due to the session being initiated by the trusted source.
The question is what configurations exist in the default setup that make the Cisco ASA act in a stateful manner?
The stateful manner was working previously.  We did an OS upgrade and received a new baseline config around the same time a few months ago.  This is around when the issue started.  I'm thinking it's a possible bug in the new IOS or a necessary config was overlooked or didn't take with the new IOS.
Problem was we upgraded the ASA OS version and the upgrade required a memory upgrade as well and memory usage was pegged at 100%.  Memory upgrade is complete now and the stateful nature of the ASA has returned to normal.
The problem is in my specific situation the ASA is denying the return traffic due to the source/destination ip's and protocols being reversed.
