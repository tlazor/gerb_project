Another way to get a good start, as well as providing long term reference material, is to grab a good book or two and start reading. I've always been a fan of Mark Minasi's books in the "Mastering..." series, which in my opinion are particularly good for newbie Windows admins to get their head around the various Windows Server versions.
Just as there's no quick and easy way for a Windows admin to switch to *nix, there's no easy way to do the reverse. The one thing you absolutely must do, unless you want to end up bald and half-crazed, is to pretty much forget what you know of HOW to do things in Linux (as opposed to WHAT to do). When faced with Windows stop thinking Linux and stop thinking they should be similar. They're not, yet it's the biggest stumbling block for those who won't accept that simple fact. You may as well be comparing dogs and chickens.
As for how to start, I suggest attending a suitable course or two if possible. Which one(s) will depend on the area you which to focus on first. Most training centers will be able to advise you further, so even if it's only to get an idea of where to start, give them a call and get a recommendation.
