Put an activity limit on your game.  Think of it as enforcing bathroom/nutrition/sleep breaks.  If you do this gently, real
If players are not interacting with each other, I wouldn't suggest worrying about it too much, whatever a player does on their local copy, is their business. If they have this much knowledge to reverse-engineer and spend so much time to do it, let them.
The good news is that it's very difficult to design a bot/script that can fool all attempts to distinguish it from a real player.
If players are interacting with each other, the only solution is to detect "bot-like" behaviour and punish it. When a human plays the game, the input is "clumsy". Humans can't move a mouse on a perfect straight line, and when clicking the same button, it's very difficult to click the same pixel twice (assuming they moved their mouse in-between). You can take advantage of that, and if you detect "too many" very precise movements, then you know something is up.
So these systems end up being arms races between the cheaters and the developers, with the battle ebbing and flowing with the stakes at play. If cheaters can make real money by farming with bots, then expect to face a dedicated adversary. There are some strategies that can help though:
There's a lot you can do code-wise, but be careful. Do not punish a player that is legit even if their actions look robotic. You can counter that by influencing the gameplay to be more active (at least the non-idle part).
Modifying your reward design seems the best approach. If being at the top of the leaderboard is giving a player extra advantages that may just perpetuate the problem of power gap seen in most pay to win games out there. If the only way to stay on top is to be on top I'd consider that a design flaw.
The bad news is that it's very difficult to design a detection process that will catch all bots/scripts. And harder still to avoid catching legit but oddly-robot-like real players in the net.
