I don't know where to do the blowfish configuration. Could someone explain in details or give a link about the configuration layout of phpmyadmin on Ubuntu 10.04 ?
I recently installed Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server on a virtual machine. I installed apache2, php and mysql. Several vhosts I sat up are running fine and I can also connect to the MySQL server using the mysql command-line client.
PS: The default installation works like a charm on my Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 laptop. No error messages and warning on the web interface.
I also have a second problem which is probably related. It says on the bottom that some features are disabled. I read somewhere that this line should be added:
I now want to setup PhpMyAdmin to allow the vhosts owners to administrate their DBs. I installed the package using apt-get install phpmyadmin. I answered the questions and accepted the creation of the phpmyadmin database. The install finished successfully.
The problem is that on the bottom it says that I need to add a blowfish_secret to the server configuration. I've done it once in Fedora but here it's different. I tried to add it at the end of the /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php and to reload apache and clear the browser cache but it had absolutely no effect (the message is still here). I also noticed several other files :
but I don't know where to put it. Again, it has no effect when put in /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php.
