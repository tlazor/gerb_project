So I have a question about the basic functionality of logstash. I have many different .L01 files which I have exported into log files. Each .L01 file represents a host and the export function dumps it into a folder-tree. I need to read the logs from these individual "host folders" including all the different sub-folders. To manually add the path of each input log is obviously not feasible. The files are all different types of logs, so I can't define a standard filter for them. If I just run logstash without defining any filters, it just dumps the whole log in the @message field like this:
So how do I configure logstash if I essentially need to read all logs generated on a computer (so naturally different types of logs) but from a folder (so can't use input plugins like syslog). Do I need to write individual filters for every single kind of log? That would need me to manually parse through all the folders and subfolders and then write a filter for each log after examining the content. I don't think I can do that because I need to do this for approximately 20 hosts. I would appreciate any help towards this.
