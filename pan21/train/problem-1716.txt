I program, administer, and support an ERP application. One of my more common tasks is to understand where data originates, finding the link between a particular report field and its data entry field in the application. To do this, I have to manually examine the DDL SQL of one or more views in order to understand the table columns, in order to match one view's table columns with another view's table columns. This manual task might require examination of four or five abstraction layers.
To be honest, the output produced by all methods can be difficult to read once you have some complex queries, and the way to get them is not so trivial, so I usually end up reading and "parsing" the DDL statements manually...
Do you have access to the execution plan? This will show how Oracle resolves view columns to base indexes or tables. You can create simple, dummy queries to focus on the particular items in which you're interested.
But since you are on 11.2, you can not use this yet. You can however collect the optimizer trace. If you already ran your query, and have its sql_id:
Is there a faster way to examine the metadata to find how a view column is calculated from its base table column? Is there a way to examine Oracle's execution plan to see the rewritten query, skipping the manual inspection of the intermediate views?
You basically pass the query text through the first, input parameter, and receive the rewritten query back through the second, output parameter.
