I'm using the Docker LinuxServer LetsEncrypt container, and I've tried just adding the IP to the server_name variable in the config, but after restarting the container, nothing appears to change when trying to navigate to https://myserver.domain.com (it still just gives the same error page instead of redirecting to the IP).
I'm trying to add my machine's LAN IP as a 'failthrough' location to use in the event the main server has issues.
Also note: if I just use https://192.168.0.194:3333 directly in a browser, it navigates to the intended page fine, so this has to be something config-wise with Nginx that I'm trying to solve. It seems like a pretty simple issue, but I'm not super familiar with Nginx config nuances yet.
Lately, my main server name (i.e. https://myserver.domain.com) has been having some issues due to LetsEncrypt certs issues, so any URL running on my server using that domain name fails as well. What I want is to have Nginx automatically pass it to the machine's IP instead if it detects the domain name itself is down.
