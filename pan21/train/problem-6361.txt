NameCheap also looks nice. There are two things i really like about them. Right on their feature page they list "Free Dynamic DNS With Client" which is pretty cool. They also have a free SSL certificate for the first year. Haven't messed a lot with certificates but this would definitely be something i would use. Only minus i can see is you only get free private whois for the first year. After that its $2.99 which isn't that big of a deal.
I'm leaning towards NameCheap now. Is this a good choice. Is there anything else i should be looking at?
This will be the first domain i've ever registered. So i'm at a loss what to look for. I definitely don't want to go with GoDaddy. 
DomainMonster looks pretty cool but i don't see anything about subdomains. Also i would assume they don't have a system for dynamic ip address updating. So you would have to constantly check that your ip of your ISP has changed or not and update it manually.
I have heard good things about DreamHost but i think its off the list because they don't give you any information about the features you get when you register your domain with them. They have a "Whats included" button the page but it mainly list the features with hosting not registration.
So i've looked at a variety of registrars so far. The three left were really NameCheap, DreamHost, & DomainMonster.
