Any hardware windows 8 or above will automatically activate a copy of windows 10, pro or home depending on the authorized version for that machine.
However if I don’t create such an offline USB image and in the event my HDD crashes, then I have lost my OEM Windows 10 on it.
I am aware that service center generally provides reactivated OEM Windows for a small fee in such cases. However instead of going to the service center, can a downloaded Windows 10 from Microsoft accept the OEM key embedded in the UEFI Firmware and proceed with successful install & activation on such an OEM Windows 10 Laptop or will it refuse to install in the first place, or will it demand a new retail key before successful activation?
There’s a possibility that this type of question might have been asked before, but I am not able to find the exact reference on this site.
Soon I am going to buy a laptop with Windows 10 OEM. (Most likely Acer brand) Generally such laptops do have a special recovery partition to refresh/reinstall Windows if the need be. The vendors also provide some app to take an offline image of OS on to a USB Pen drive so that if necessary the OEM OS can be installed from that USB drive to get back the laptop to factory default state.
