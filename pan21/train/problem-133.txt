Did I understand correctly, you reboot them on different days.  If not you need to follow HopelessN00b's advice.
We have 3 DCs in our environment running AD, DNS and DHCP on a Win2k8 R2 OS. We reboot our servers monthly on different days to apply security patches. During the reboots we would get some complaints from users that they lose connectivity to our intranet sites. I know it's directly related to the reboots since our intranet web servers are authenticated to these controllers. But I was hoping someone could explain and help me understand the reasons that my web server fails?
Probably because the servers hosting your intranet are unable to authenticate users, with all your domain controllers being down.  Likewise, if your intranet serves content hosted on other domain servers, those servers may be unable to authenticate the web servers to allow them to access whatever resource they need.
The proper approach is to stagger your domain controller reboots.  Reboot one, wait until it's back online.  Then reboot the next.  Repeat.
I have seen this when a system or process depends on FSMO role such as PDC emulator.  If you have the same issue when you reboot each DC then this is not relevant.
