There are a great many tutorials on TLS and x509 certificates. Here is one introduces the topic: How to Use X.509 Certificates and SSL For Secure Communications
You may issue different x509 certificates for every host or site.  Or, if using one certificate, subject alternative names and wildcard host names are commonly supported.
If you do not already have the certificate PFX, export it from one of the existing IIS servers that may have the certificate.  
Installing the certificate on one server + Exporting the public/private keys of the certificate for installation on additional servers
This is largely platform dependent if you need the actual steps, so if you do, let me know your OS and IIS version and I'll edit my answer.
You can use a wildcard certificate (*.example.com) and import it on a server. The same can be said for a certificate with different subject alternate names. For simplicity, a pfx-type of certificate is the easiest. You can import this certificate on all servers and use it.
If the certificate private key is marked as "not exportable", you may use JailBreak to export the certificate. 
Use the same process to import the certificate PFX into the local machine Personal/My store using the Certificates MMC on the other IIS servers, then use IIS Manager to select the certificate.
