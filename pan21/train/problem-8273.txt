Unless you have a very specific situation where you desperately need to reclaim the space, I would not defragment - especially since it requires downtime for the to-be-defragmented database.
The only unconditionally justified use of defragmentation is when it is done as a "cleanup" after a database repair operation in my opinion. In most other cases, you simply should not care. The mail database tends to rather grow than shrink over time, so database areas marked as "free" today are going to be utilized shortly in the future. 
Whitespace is not inherently a horrible thing.  It's a completely natural thing to have happen over the course of natural MS database usage.  That said, I would only look at removing the whitespace if I was having issues with backups completing in a timely fashion, otherwise I don't care, and I'd rather not take a chance of causing an issue with the database.
I know how to perform an offline defragmentation - I am just curious as to what criteria the community uses as to when to run an offline defrag.  Boss saw a few dbs with about 30% whitespace and now wants to offline defrag all databases.
