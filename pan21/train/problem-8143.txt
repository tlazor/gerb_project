People who look at the headers will see your mail server, and possible email you if the client's postmaster@ address doesn't lead to satisfaction.
My question here is - which domain should have the 'postmaster' or 'abuse' or 'fbl' accounts? My domain or client domain?
To use FBL with your IPs you need to set the ENVELOPE FROM address to your own domain, even if your clients use their own domain in From and Reply-To headers. That makes it necessary to set the FBL email address to your own domain, alongwith abuse@ and postmaster@ addresses. Your clients should have their own abuse@ and postmaster@ address at their own domain, and you don't necessarily need access to those inboxes. Most spam reporters will send the abuse report to ENVELOPE FROM address hosting domain, which is you.
Consider that I am providing SMTP services for several clients and the sender / SMTP domain is mails.mysmtp.com. When client A is using my email infrastructure, he may use from address (from header) as 'info@client1domain.com', same way client B may use an account 'info@client2domain.com'.
