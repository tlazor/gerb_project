RedGrittyBrick's comment is correct, and I have done this in the past myself. Like he said, disable DHCP and NAT, ignore the WAN/ADSL port and they will act just like a normal ethernet switch.
It's a bit of a faff because you're not really using the routers like they are designed to be used, but I've had a system like that working in a previous house for over a year. I even sold the setup to the new tenant when I moved out!
They will probably all need a static IP address set because they are more than just a switch. Once each one is set to an address that you know won't interfere with other devices (i.e. make sure it's out of the main router's DHCP range and not the same as any other static IP in use on your network), you can plug them all together using the normal LAN ports.
To use them as multiple access points, just make sure they are all set to broadcast the same SSID (wireless network name) and have the same security type and password. This way your wireless devices will jump between them automatically and you will experience a seamless connection.
