EDIT: I forgot to say, I want the users to be able to authenticate with the mail server using their domain credentials.
I wish the emails themselves to be stored on mail.domain.tld, and users can access them remotely from other boxes with Thunderbird via imap and smtp.
I want this server to handle all email for domain users, and forward any emails that are bound for other domains (Gmail for example) to a separate email server, let's call it big-mail.domain.tld. This separate server already exists and is configured.
I would like to set up an email server, using Redhat 7.6, let's call it mail.domain.tld. The box is realm-joined to that domain. I want to create email addresses for domain users, for example fred@mail.domain.tld, (note that I do want the mail hostname to be there, because fred@domain.tld is already in use by the domain).
Is such an arrangement even possible? Is it possible using Postfix and Dovecot? I have been trying to follow many tutorials, but I am unfamiliar with the exact terminology to look for, and my use case seems to be somewhat unusual. This is the way I want it to work, because big-mail.domain.tld is not under my control, nor is the Active Directory domain controller itself.
