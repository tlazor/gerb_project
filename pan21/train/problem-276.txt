You should definitely ensure that all appliances are properly grounded if they are designed to require a ground connection - for electrical safety if nothing else.
Many electrical devices can cause voltage spikes on the mains, transient electromagnetic fields, or both, when they are switched on or off - especially anything that contains an inductor such as the windings of a motor, a transformer, or the magnetic ballast found in older fluorescent lights. It sounds as if one of these effects is causing a brief dip or spike in your laptop's internal power rails, or an interfering signal on a data communication bus, which makes it think that a device has been disconnected. Of the two effects I'd suspect a power dip or spike on the mains would be more likely than the electromagnetic route. If you have a working battery you can check which is the culprit by seeing whether the effect still occurs when the laptop is running on battery and not connected to its adapter.
It sounds like something you should try and resolve, as the same effect could be causing data corruption if it happens while your laptop is writing data to disk, for example.
