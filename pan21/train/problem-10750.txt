Nevertheless, it is strange that the parser behaves differently when used explicitly and implicitly, AFAIK the same code is running in both cases. Please open an issue about it on the syslog-ng github page
it seems to me that the message does not comply to the syslog RFC, and the program field is missing, I'd say that's the root cause. If such a thing happens, syslog-ng uses some heuristics to try and parse the message. The missing 1,2017/08/14 part of your message is probably parsed into the $PROGRAM field. As a workaround, check if using the following template solves the problem: template("$PROGRAM $MSG\n")) 
Alternatively, if the above does not work, then check if you can use a filter to separate the problematic messages (for example, based on the sender host), and you can use a junction to use the no-parse flag only on these messages. You can find an example for a similar case in the docs: https://www.balabit.com/documents/syslog-ng-ose-latest-guides/en/syslog-ng-ose-guide-admin/html/junctions.html
