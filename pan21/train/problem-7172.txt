My Macbook is at home at the moment, so I'm working with the Linux port of VLC here, but the basic process should be the same. Under Preferences, make sure you have it set to show you all settings rather than "Simple." 
As others have already guessed, it's probably the Macbook's sudden motion sensor combined with the fact that VLC has a very small playback buffer out of the box. Increasing the buffer size should fix the problem.
Mac Laptops have what's called a "Sudden Motion Sensor" and will stop the hard drive if it detects motion.  The idea is to prevent damage to the drive while it is spinning so you won't lose your data or the entire drive.  This is a good thing.  Macbook Pro's aren't meant to be portable media players.
Next browse to Input / Codecs --> Access Modules --> File. The default caching value on my install is 300ms. I'd imagine that bumping that up to a few seconds should solve your skipping problem. 
ThinkPad laptops with motion sensor has the "feature" that parks drive heads when you shake the computer. It is here to save your HDD in case laptop will fell down or hit something very hard. But it does affect music and video playing the same way - it stops for a seconds. Not sure if Macs has that "feature" though.
