After a while (in which I was away from this job) I found the following: VMWare upgraded to 7.1, an installation of VirtualBox (dunno if it has something to do with our theme), the settings from V-1, V-2 and W-1 untouched(?) and the following 'weird' situation:
All of them had a different IP static address, V-1 and V-2 were bridged to the W-1's NIC. V-1, V-2 and W-1 were/are in a domain with DNS servers S-1 and S-2.
Only the first VM can access the network. IOW, if I start the V-1 I can see (ping, filesharing etc.) W-1, S-1 and the entire LAN. If after this I start V-2 from V-2 I can see only the W-1. Any other ping (including to the S-1) gives an 'Request time out'. 
Similarily, if I start first the V-2 and after this the V-1, then the V-2 works ok in LAN while V-1 does not (it sees only its host system).
You might want to check the assigned MAC addresses of both instances to ensure that they are not somehow the same.
We could open both V-1 and V-2 and see the W-1, S-1, S-2 and all the network (ping, file share etc.).
On workstation W-1 (WinXP - 64bit) we had two virtual machines (VMWare 6.5) V-1 and V-2 (both with WinXP-32).
