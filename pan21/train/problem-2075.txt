I also have a USB to IDE/SATA adapter that lets me hang the drive as external off the PC for cases where I want to erase a drive removed from service.  Disconnect the internal PC drive for safety.
Of course, your organization's security policy comes from somewhere; when you're wondering what is an appropriate method to securely wipe sensitive data to put into your security policy, you'll find a number of suggestions in the other responses to this question. :-)
For a good free solution, use the 'shred' command from Knoppix .   It allows you to run the command from a computer that you are discarding without needing to remove the drive first.
Some work has been done on using scanning electron microscopes to detect residual magnetic flux on hard drives.  The origin of the 'seven passes with random data' notion is that this would make the flux lost in the noise from the overwritten random patterns.
In theory the SEM methods work but they are very slow - if you're really keen to destroy the data on a disk wipe it with any disk erase utility first and then physically destroy the drive.  If you're feeling really keen take the drive apart, remove the platters and run them over a bulk eraser.
When it comes to security, technical advice (such as you receive here) is only half the question.  You also have to be able to justify your actions to an auditor.  And auditors aren't so concerned with the results of your actions, but that you followed the appropriate procedures as set down in the appropriate policy.  The auditor's job it make sure that some cowboy (or cowgirl) doesn't just go around doing whatever they think is right, without oversight or justification.
