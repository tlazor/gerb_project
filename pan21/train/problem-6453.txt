The question is: Is there any existing VPN service that will make my dreams come true, and is easy to use, which I could connect over PPTP or OpenVPN (I want to set up connection to VPN in my router settings).
So, in order to get a good internet connection I made a plan: connect to the VPN-service over IPv6, and pass all IPv4 traffic through IPv6 tunnel, or something like that, I think you get the idea.
Edit: It seems like there are couple of VPN services that supports IPv6 (it's odd, but the biggest VPN services support only IPv4), and there is none providing 4in6 tunnels.
I'm not good at networking, never did things like that, and don't know where to start, and what should I do.
You're (potentially) on the right track with an OpenVPN and VPS type solution. The part you're likely missing is a route statement in the OpenVPN config to force it to take all IPv4 traffic.
I have a local network with internet access. But unfortunately IPv4 internet connection speed is limited to 1mbps, which is realy sad. Fortunately I have a native IPv6, and there is no connection speed limit over IPv6.
The use case, as I undestand, should look like this: I connect from my home computer to the VPS via OpenVPN, and after that all my IPv4 traffic pass through IPv6 (server do the job). OpenVPN - because I want to configure VPN connection to server in my router (Asus RT-N16?).
