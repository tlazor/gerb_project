As you can see, I'm using Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 with driver update 19.40.0.3 . I don't know when this problem started because I'm mostly on wired connection but its has been a few weeks since I noticed this problem.
The problem is that my WiFi connection abruptly disconnects from the Internet on my Laptop, while other devices on the same WiFi run quite fine. It does not disconnect from the WiFi, the WiFi icon in the tray just shows an exclamation mark indicating that the internet connection is lost while WiFi is connected. At this state I cannot even access my Router from my device.
Has anyone faced this particular problem? Is it a driver issue? I'm lost. Any speculations on where the problem lies? Can anyone resolve this situation?
My interim solution so far has been deleting the WiFi profile from Settings> WiFi> Manage Known Networks and re-entering the password after clicking Settings> WiFi> Show Available Networks and then everything works fine but its a hit or miss most of the time.
