Your question is a little ambiguous.  By "copy from that USB drive" you might mean that you're manipulating the files from within the VM, to or from another drive surfaced within the VM.  Or you might mean that the VM is functioning as a file server, using the USB drive for storage.
You could, for instance, completely delete all the virtual NICs associated with the VM and you'd still get storage devices within the VM.
If you were talking about using the VM as a file server, then all the same statements about storage apply, but you'll see the files served to external machines using networking.
If you meant that you're just using the USB drive as a disk within the VM, then there's no networking involved at all.  Block storage traffic from the VM to the host machine happens through something called "VMBus" which is a paravirtualized I/O subsystem.  You can see this in Device Manager within the VM if you choose "View Devices by Connection."  It will be the parent of the SCSI or IDE controller you mapped the disk to.
