Plus to the script that can be found following first link you can add this code to work will all possible keyboard layouts.
You can disable that shortcut on the Keys page of the Cygwin terminal's options (together with the Alt+Enter shortcut for fullscreen, for which Alt+F11 can be used instead).
Here is the Autohotkey script I am using (by the way it is only for theoretical completeness that I re-map the lefthand Ctrl key to be the lefthand Windows button -- I have never actually pressed it when using emacs):
Any ideas on why Autohotkey won't do the M-SPC as I would expect, or why C-M-SPC is understood by emacs as a C-SPC (I suspect)?
This means that an emacs sequence like Ctrl-xCtrl-c is done with my left thumb pressing on the key labelled 'Alt' to produce the Ctrl. Ok.
Alt+Space is a standard Windows shortcut for showing the window menu, which you can also get by left-clicking on the window icon or right-clicking on the titlebar.
I am using emacs in Cygwin and have used Autohotkey to re-map the lefthand 'Alt' key and the lefthand 'Windows' key to be (left)Ctrl and (left)Alt respectively.
To be clear, when I say 'all is ok' I mean that within emacs I use the 'describe key sequence' feature (C-h then k) and then try out the key combination I want. For example, all of these show the emacs documentation for the sequence I expected:
