wava: a memory-aware scheduler that allows to enqueue batch jobs (submitted with a maximum physical memory usage promise) to be executed when enough physical memory (RSS) is available in the system.
We're currently setting up a server to some heavy lifting (ETL) after another process has finished within the business, at the moment we're firing off jobs either via scheduled cron jobs or remote execution (via ssh). Early on this week we hit a issue with too many jobs running side by side on the system which brought all the jobs to a snail pace as they fought for CPU time. 
I've been looking for a batch scheduler, a system where we can insert jobs into a run queue and the system will process them one by one. Can anyone advise on a program/system to do this with? Low cost / FOSS would be appreciated due to the shoe-string nature of this project.
Sun Grid Engine (SGE). SGE is a distributed resource management software and it allows the resources within the cluster/machine (cpu time,software, licenses etc) to be utilized effectively.
