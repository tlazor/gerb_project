However, if you want a good NAS, I would highly recommend Freenas, it uses UFS and it works very well.
I guess for HFS, you could always just use a HFS friendly distribution and enable networking on it...
You can bung this on any old pc. I personally bought a Celeron machine for around £60 (although I spent another £70 on a 4-bay hot swap hard drive holder!).
I have used it from Macs without any problem, it even supports AFS (Apple Filing Protocol), I have never used this, but surely that has to be even better!
I recently setup an unRaid server for my Nas and it works great so far.  I suggest you take a loot, it requires some setup but the initial cost can be low and you can use existing drives plus it's super simple to add additional storage down the road and everything is semi-raid so if you loose one drive you can easily recover.  The only thing it doesn't do is allow timemachine backups but that's minor in my opinion.
I expect the more expensive QNAP's to be the same, and also the cheaper ones (e.g. the TS-219P+) as they all run the same custom Linux.
