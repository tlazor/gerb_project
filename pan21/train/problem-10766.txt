Also, if this isn't entirely possible, or if its a big process, I can just move www.site1.com to the www.site2.com's server, and use virtual hosts, that is an option that I would be okay with. 
When I go to my wanip I get the site1.com which is correct, when I go to my wanip:1235 its correct, its site2.com. Perfect. But my site2.com needs /blog/wordpress to be in the right directory, so when I go to www.wanip:1235/blog/wordpress my browser switches it to wanip/blog/wordpress so it goes back to site1.com and 404's because that box doesn't have /blog/wordpress 
I need www.site2.com to go to the right server. Is this something I can do in the virtual hosts of www.site1.com or is it something else. 
The Problem: I have 2 domains, 2 web servers, 1 WAN IP. 1 server is hosting www.site1.com, and the other should be hosting, www.site2.com. I forwarded the domain, to a port that is forwarded to that box. wanip:1235, 1235 is then forwarded to the internal IP of site2's server. But when I go to www.site2.com I get the 404 page of www.site1.com.
