Oracle Sql Developer has one really cool plugin from FourthElephant called Insider.  It is a database monitor.  It is a simple version that is free.  (The advanced one you have to pay for.)
I agree Oracle SQLDEveloper is pretty good and a great price.  We use it more than Toad now.  Some early gotcha's ...
OK, I've used TOAD in the past and it's pretty cool, but I don't feel like spending that kind of coin. What other Oracle 10g SQL editors are there? 
If your'e doing basic sysadmin queries, just use the standard Oracle SQL*Plus client that comes with a standard install.  No additional cost.
One really odd alternative for you developers reading this are the oracle tools for visual studio.  It has just about everything in it including debugging and is a free add-on for visual studio.  If you are a developer that loves visual studio but is also trying to manage a test database this is a powerful tool.
One thing I really like about it is how it handle reference cursors.  For some reason it is the best tool I have found for testing my reference cursors.
The tool that comes with Oracle, Enterprise Manager, is a good approach but doesn't give you the same type of visual cueing.  Give it a try, its free.
