POVRay is a raytracer with a custom file format (POV). As far as I can tell, the POV format is not very supported very well by third-party converters, although it is an ASCII format and you could write your own conversion. It runs on the command-line, so it is not technically an issue. However, the license requires you to obtain written permission from the POVRay authors before distributing it with your program. 
Generally, what distinguishes high-quality architectural renders is how well the light propagation is done. "Radiosity" or "Global Illumination" would be the keywords to search for here. There are ways to do these calculations in your XNA application as well. For example, with an artistic eye you can fake radiosity by adding extra lights to the scene, or you could implement a full-blown per-vertex iterative radiosity solver
In the open source category, You could also consider alternatives such as Yafaray (open source),which uses its own XML format, or LuxRender (unbiased, open source). Generally you will need to export the camera and lights and scene out to a file and invoke the raytracer. If you have the luxury of being able to wait a few hours for a render, the unbiased results of LuxRender make for some high-quality architectural shots. The Yafaray render should take seconds to minutes.
