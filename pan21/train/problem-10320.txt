I'm not entirely sure whether "Block" in Pidgin is server-side or not. I think it's server-side if your server supports the feature, but not all do.
I'm wondering which of these options are local, which of these has an effect on the server's state, and what's the difference?
In traditional XMPP/Jabber, there are several "components" of adding a contact, partly influenced by the fact that it's designed to be a federated network (like email).
All three options are server-side. In most chat apps, adding someone as a "contact" consists of 2, 3, and 4 together. The same applies to Google Talk, I believe â€“ if you have someone in your contact list, that automatically lets them see when you're online, and some of these menu items won't work at all.
Pidgin has numerous options for the Google Talk contact (you can see them when you right-click on the contact):
(Of course, in most XMPP clients, the steps are simplified into one. The menu items are there just in case someone needed more precise control.)
