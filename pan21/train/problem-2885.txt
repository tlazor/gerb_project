FYI, here are the temperature specs for the current MacBook Pro. Other Mac models are roughly the same.
If it was off, or sleeping, you're probably fine. There's no way to check other than using it and seeing if it's acting strange or tearing it apart and visually verifying - but even then you can't know for sure. If it was left on in those temps you run more of a risk, but modern computers, both PC and Mac, will shut themselves down when getting too hot.
There's a Diagnostics tool on the OS X installation or applications DVD that cam with your machine. For more info see this page.
It's not hard for the temperature inside a car to reach 113Â° F even on relatively mild days, so the moral of this story is, if you want to keep it within the parameters the system has been designed and tested to support, do not leave your Mac in your car, and if you do, certainly don't use it until it cools down a bit.
that way you can do some basic HW checks. If you hav your MacBook covered by an AppleCare protection plan you are allowed to download a tool called TechTool Pro, which does some basic tests, too.
