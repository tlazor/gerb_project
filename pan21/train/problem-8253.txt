The "trick" is to first "mount bind" the directory to overlay to another one, then use an union file system to combine the unchangeable original with the "changes" directory.
For a standard (K)Ubuntu installation please ensure that the package "unionfs-fuse" is installed - it may be installed using the command line "sudo apt-get install unionfs-fuse".
1.3 Use unionfs file system to combine the relocated original contents with the contents of the "changes" dir
Files created or modified in the "original" directory will be available only in the "changes" directory.
1.2 Use the mount bind option to mount the directory to the "overlay unwritable" dir (/tmp/home_user1_relocated)
Here is a use case that was succcessfully tested on a (K)Ubuntu system (Linux step3 3.13.0-63-generic #103-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux).
Please acknowledge that the following is just a sort of proof-of-concept, adjust the arguments to the commands to your individual needs.
[now all changes to /home/user1 are saved in /tmp/home_user1_changes, but not in "overlaid" /home/user1]
Files created in the "relocated" directory will be persistent available in the "original" directory, but not in the "changes" directory.
2.2 Use the mount bind option to mount the directory to the "overlay unwritable" dir (/tmp/home_user1_relocated)
[now all changes to /home/user1 are saved in /tmp/home_user1_changes, but not in "overlaid" /home/user1]
For example the following instructions describe how to overlay an existing, non empty (user home) directory "with itself" so that all changes are stored persistent in a directory (case 1.) or 
2.4 Use unionfs file system to combine the relocated original contents with the contents of the "changes" dir
1.3.1 unionfs-fuse -o cow -o allow_other -o use_ino -o nonempty /tmp/home_user1_changes=RW:/tmp/home_user1_relocated=RO /home/user1
Make (non empty) dir (e.g. /home/user1) unwritable so that all changes and all newly created files persist only temporarily (in /tmp/home_user1_changes)
2.4.1 unionfs-fuse -o cow -o allow_other -o use_ino -o nonempty /tmp/home_user1_changes=RW:/tmp/home_user1_relocated=RO /home/user1
