It is possible that your router is blocking the PCs MAC Address or IP Address. My router has this functionality, and I've used it before and forgotten about it and wondered why, it also has a delay from when the computer connects to the network to when it is blocked. I'd think it's unlikely this is the case though.
I'm basically clueless also. The only thing that comes to mind is that possibly you are having problems reaching/using the DNS servers. I realize that the fact that your laptop & iPhone work implies that this is not the problem. But I'm not sure what else to suggest.
When the internet connection goes, does the network conenction as well? Eg can you access file shares on other computers?
Get a website's IP address (By using http://locateip.co.uk, eg bbc.co.uk = 212.58.224.138), and note it down somewhere, when the internet connection dissapears on your PC enter the IP Address into a browser and see if the page will load. If it does then there's something wrong with the DNS settings on your computer (like it's set to an incorrect server). 
I would suggest switching over to using either Google Public DNS or the Open DNS servers. They are free and supposedly provide some basic "bad site" filtering benefits so why not try switching and see what happens?
