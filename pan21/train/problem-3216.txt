This of course made me think there was an issue with the DNS server provided by my router at work, so I created a /etc/resolv.conf.head in order to include Google's public DNS server into my /etc/resolv.conf file. I then ran sudo nscd -i hosts and restarted and things improved a bit. I was then able to at least access these pages, but the lookup time was terrible for each site (~5 seconds). Needing to get work done, I settled with that.
Now at home I am running into the same issues, which is perplexing. I am connected to my home wifi using the same netctl profile that I used to use without problem. I thought that maybe somehow Google's DNS was now causing an issue, so I removed the .head file I had created to fix the problem at work. I am still unable to load the same webpages, like wikipedia. I included Google's DNS in a tail file. Here is my resolv.conf file:
What is confusing me even further is that dig returns no error when I force a DNS lookup for one of the problem sites:
I am running an install of Arch Linux on my laptop, and up until recently everything was going fine. I am was using netctl to connect to wifi, which went smoothly. Recently I started a job and my workplace's network uses WPA2 Enterprise, so I found it easier to directly use wpa_supplicant to connect to the network there. Once I did so however, I started to run into DNS issues. Most sites would load fine, but some like archlinux.org and wikipedia would fail to load in chromium, returning DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN errors. I was also unable to ping these by hostname, but I could by IP.
Any pointers here would be greatly appreciated. I am aware of similar questions here, but the ones I have read have not helped the issue much.
I have an imperfect understanding of this stuff, but this suggest to me that I was able to actually resolve the hostname when using dig, but it still doesn't work when pinging or in browser.
