Configure a perimeter network, place the remote desktop server in the perimeter, and use an inexpensive VPN to provide the access.  An example would be Hamachi.  Note that disallowing Internet access from a perimeter network is also a good practice.  
Use smart cards or some other type of two-factor authentication.  This is typically expensive and found predominately in large organizations, however the options are improving (PhoneFactor comes to mind).  Note that requiring smart cards can be done per-server, as an option to configuring it at the account level.  
If possible, do not provide a full desktop, but publish the applications that they need.  If someone only needs access to a single application, it is also possible to configure an "initial program", which could be a simple wrapper shell that can enforce a logoff when the application closes.  
Disallow Internet access from that server.  Many of the more serious malware attempts to communicate back to their command and control server when it compromises your system.  Configuring a firewall access rule to disallow outbound access by default, and a rule to allow outbound access only to internal/known networks and RFC 1928 subnets can mitigate the risk.
