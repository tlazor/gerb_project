I have seen this issue before, caused by Hard Drive errors being written to the event log every second. Check your Event Viewer and the System subheading in case there are any errors.
Check whether there is something running which is using more of the CPU than it should by opening task manager (ctrl + alt + delete or right click the task bar and select 'Start task Manager') and navigating to the process tab. Sort by percentage of CPU usage by clicking on the CPU header. If you attempt to open your browser and notice that there is indeed a rogue process, i would hazard a guess and say it stems from some malware.
Personally, i don't think it sounds like a hardware issue. It sounds to me like a a program or service is using up more of the processor than it should.
HDD was changed, system was reinstalled and problem disappeared, so this mystery will remain unsolved.
My system keeps freezing for about 1-2 second every time I try to do something. For example,  when I enter URL in browser, it freezes and starts working after few seconds. It is probably related to hard drive. I installed HD tune and when benchmark is in progress, causing constant disk use, everything works fine in background, there are no lags. What can be the reason of this issue?
