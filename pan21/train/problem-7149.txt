Then connect one to one switch and the other to a second switch, these can be L2 switches easily, so long as you're using Active/Passive and both switches connect to one or more routers - actually even without dual routers you'd have added a great deal of resilience by just doing what I said. IP is pretty irrelevant here too by the way.
From eth0 ie NIC 1's wire goes to Main Switch from Main Switch wire goes to Node1's Switch & as Daisy Chain its going on till last Node's Switch.
Or I have to write program which maintain ip address & check its connectivity. If one node fails to communicate with server's 1 NIC then that java program send request from different NIC which have different network address '10.111.18.xxx'. I can keep program in each node so they can change their own ip as per NIC response.(These program is also theoretical right now if i got reply yes then i try to find out how to write these program)
I am Trying to achieve Network Redundancy in network which have 1 server & lots of node which use 1 switch for each.
Can anybody tell me whether this thought really work in same network means all ip within 10.111.17.0 to 10.111.17.254
You really don't need L3 switches to add resilience, it's almost irrelevant - what you need is dual NICs, ideally using different processors and drivers - and team them within the OS.
