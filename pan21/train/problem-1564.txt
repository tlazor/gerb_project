Apparently, a common cause of SD Card deaths is a malfunctioning controller chip. What they do to get at the data is remove the storage chips from the card, and then read out the raw state of those chips into an imagefile. Then they sort that imagefile out into the bits and bytes that the controller would otherwise present to the card reader.
Of course I wasn't happy that my pictures would incur further costs, but I have to say their prices are very reasonable. I was quoted a price of 126â‚¬ to be paid only if recovery was successful, and after being able to review thumbnails of the images recovered.
In my case, it was a 4GB standard-size SD-Card. And it stopped working from one day to the next while remaining seated in my digital camera. The camera gave me the following two error messages (one on top of the other):

First I made sure that the card itself had a defect, not the filesystem, or the card reader in the camera, or whatever else it could conceivably be. I tried all of the following:
And when none of those things helped, I decided to look into professional data recovery options. I found a small company in Dresden, Germany, that specializes in Flash recovery: Recoverfab
