You can restore the database using the LDF file only if you have Full backups and Log backups until now with no gap between them (corrupt log backup). 
The LDF is not a log backup, so I think you're stuck with restoring the db as it was during the last full backup. If you had transaction log backups since the last full backup, you could restore those as well and get you up to your most recent one.
There's another tool that can be used in the same scenario to read the transactions from the LDF file and create a redo script for them - ApexSQL Log. 
The current log file can be backed up. It is called tail-of-log backup that can be used at the final of the restoration process. You will restore this backup with Recovery option at last after restoring FULL + ALL LOG backups 
It was essential that your database was in the Full recovery model and no transaction log backups were created in the last 15 days. That provided that all transactions that happened after the full database backup were still in your LDF file. Otherwise, there would have been a gap between your LDF and full database backup transactions and you would not be able to recover everything successfully (maybe that was the case)
