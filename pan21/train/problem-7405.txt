Anyways, in terms of practical advice -- I've had a flick through this guide and it seems to describe what you want to do well enough, if you're using a Red Hat based distro.  If you're on SLES, Symantec SFHA ships with the vxfen solution.  I'm not sure of any solutions for Debian / Ubuntu off the top of my head.
The danger situation is "what happens when my heartbeat interconnects go down?" -- that's where I/O fencing comes into play.  This involves configuring fencing with quorum disks (which are presented to each node in the cluster).  In the event of cluster connectivity loss, the nodes of the cluster race for control of the quorum disks.  Whoever wins gets to import the disks.  All other nodes will kernel panic.  See Shoot The Other Node In The Head for more information and why it's not an overreaction!
Sounds like you effectively want some form of clustering configured with I/O fencing to prevent disks from being mounted on more than one node at a time.  If you're intending to share storage between hosts in an active-passive failover scenario, this is the way to do it. 
Basically, your disks will be monitored via the clustering software.  You'll be able to import and mount them on one node of the cluster (and will prevent you from doing so on other nodes).
