CLOUDBERRY: They have an "Explorer" product which looks like an S3 Browser or Cyberduck-like interface to different storage.  Not sync, but could be effective for just getting files up. They also have a "Backup" product as well which supports Amazon Drive.
EXPANDRIVE: they seem to offer a "network drive" style interface. So it's more like direct saves to the source. This is probably good if you're always connected to the internet and are working with smaller files. But it's a little different than sync.
ARQ: Backup solution.  I've seen this come up in several forums (usually it's odrive and arq that are mentioned), but I haven't used this before.
GOODSYNC: Goodsync seems to show up in search results, but when I look at their website product pictures, it doesn't give me a whole lot of confidence. It seems more like manual sync than automatic, in-line sync (Dropbox-style, like odrive provides) through Finder/Explorer.
CLOUDSYNC and QNAP: Specific solutions if you own a NAS from Synology or QNAP. I own a Drobo, so I couldn't use these, but I would have liked to have tried them out if I could.
ODRIVE: odrive seems to be the straightforward choice since it is one of the top Featured Apps and specifically mentions desktop sync in its description.  There's a video which shows how sync works (similar to Dropbox/Google Drive), but there's a twist about how it has placeholder files to save disk space.  It's a short 2-min video clip: https://www.odrive.com/amazon-drive-sync.  I've used odrive for a while and I like it a lot because I have a lot of cloud storage accounts (in addition to Amazon Drive), so it helps me stay organized.
CLOUDHQ: this looks like it replicates stuff between clouds, which is different than syncing files between your computer and Amazon Drive. It looks interesting if you are worried about backing up stuff that is already in the Amazon Drive / don't trust Amazon Drive to be completely reliable or available.
