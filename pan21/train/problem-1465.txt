Yes, but you have to lie to NTP.  Essentially, you pick one server to be the time server, and then configure NTP on that host to be authoritative even though it has no grounds to be so (ie, no direct-access to a stratum zero server, or network access to a lower-stratum server).  Then and only then you configure the others to look to the "authoritative" server, and they'll sync to it.  Otherwise no host will consider itself authoritative, and will not allow anyone else to sync to it, which is what you're seeing.
My question is , is there any fundamental problem with this setup. Will the NTP work in such isloated network that has no direct or indirect connection with reliable internet time source ?
of linux and another opensolaris machine as server and these server machines are syncing time with themselves (local clock) only. The server machines in this case have NTP running on them as well. Within a few minutes of starting the ntp daemon ,client starts syncing time with itself only and remains in that situation after that.All servers are discarded and no time syncing is done with them.
