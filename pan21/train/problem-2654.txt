I also think LVM is a good thing to learn about and use.  However, if you're using Linux in a virtual environment, it's less of an issue, since it's not such a big deal to go about resizing virtual disks, and therefore the advantage of LVM is a bit diminished (although there are still advantages).  I've been trying to learn Linux administration via the command shell, so I've tiered my learning.  I've left out LVM for now and have gotten fairly familiar with the old way for the time being...
..but whether you choose to use LVM or not, there's no getting around learning about what the intended use of the various directories are.  Once you know these, you're better equipped to make your own decisions about how to partition.  You can read more about that in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
On a production server, /var in its own partition is a good idea, not only because you may need a lot of space for it (as you've discovered), but also because if it fills up with logs, you don't want it bringing your whole server to a grinding halt.
So with the way I tend to use Linux, I have /var and /srv and /home as areas which are likely to grow a lot, and I use a separate partition for all of these mount points.  I'd also prefer to move the MySQL storage location from /var  to /srv, so all the data for services are under the one easy-to-remember location.  Also, websites which arent relevant to just one single user, I also tend to move from /var/www to /srv/www for consistency.
Also, I tend to create a mount point /srv, and mount a separate partition there too.  If I need storage for services, I put them all under /srv (usually it's Samba shares I deal with).
