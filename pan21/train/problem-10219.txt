Something like iotop will help, there are various versions so look at THIS one an google some others too.
You should not install this version, its binary incompatible with the files it creates. Just copy the pidstat program it compiled and stick it in /usr/local/bin instead.
Note that you need to be running a kernel that came with at least CentOS 5.4. Frankly if your not update anyway, there are numerous security reasons to do so and CentOS 5.6 was released very recently.
Whilst sysstat is available for CentOS, the particular package you want doesnt come shipped with CentOS 5.
I have a server (running CentOS 5) and I need to figure out which programs (MySQL, Apache, etc) are doing the most Disk I/O? Is there a command that will allow me to calculate an average over time?
What you'll need to do is download sysstat from the main page which is  here. Configure and compile it. The latest version comes with a program called pidstat. This program will give you what you want. It works much like other *stat utilities like iostat, mpstat and vmstat. Note to pass the -d flag.
You might try installing the sysstat package and use SAR and iostat.  They give better visibility over a range of time if that is what you are looking for.
