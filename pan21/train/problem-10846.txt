In the Network Sharing Center on Windows 7, you need to put on the compatibility mode for Windows XP.
this enabled me to find the shared folder, use shared printer on win 7 machine but it does not appear on the list of machines in the Network Places
You might have a problem with the Server and/or "Computer Browser" services, in which case just restarting those services will solve all your ills.
To do it straight forward you must have the same account name with the same password on both computers, then that'll work. I did this for my wife laptop that is running Windows XP and she can access shared folders on my Windows 7 computers without any problems.
This is probably because the "Password-protected shares" option is disable that it doesn't work... Also, do you have a password on each computer? If there is one computer that have no password on admin account, sharing won't work, for security reasons.
Ran into the same problem, this solved the problem for me although it might be unsuitable for your environment.
