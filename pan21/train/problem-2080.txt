Finally, there is the matter of the element id's like person-name, you use them more than once so you should use a constant. Now the question is, should this constant be defined in Model, View or Controller ? I personally define these id's in the View class and then the controller asks the View what the element is, so that it can attach the listener. I dont think the MVC pattern goes into this detail, so it's up to you.
Also, updateView does not belong in the controller, it should be part of your view class which should contain all view related logic.
I am assuming you are used to getters/setters because you are experienced in another language, please don't do this. Performance matters, there is no good reason to download all those functions for no good reason, model-person.js should be
Furthermore, I think in the original pattern, the model actually updates the view, meaning that the controller should not be done the one doing controller.updateView();, that should be handled implicitly by controller.modelPerson.setName(this.textContent);
Personally, I like your approach better, I think the controller should decide when the UI gets updated.
