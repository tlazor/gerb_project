You really want to test if a single character is inside the search word, than a full blown string. Testing if a single character is inside a string can be done with indexOf, and then comparing if its larger or equals to 0
This should actually be called charsGuessedCorrectly, because it contains a list of characters the user already used. Even better would be changing the type to a Set<Character> so you can directly use its contains method without turning the whole object to a string.
In your test letter method you repeat the majority of the checks you make in your if statement, I think this hurts the readability of your code the most. One example of this is your first if statement and the second else if statement only vary by the last equality check. This equality check could instead occur in an if statement inside if the first check. 
Generally, I think it is a good idea to limit the number of conditionals in an if statement. This won't always be true but it is one quick improvement you could make in your code.
Calling setVisible fro the constructor makes extending your class hard, because any exception thrown from within a sub classes constructor will mean the object is left in a inconsistent state. Better would be removing this line form the constructor and adding it to the main method.
