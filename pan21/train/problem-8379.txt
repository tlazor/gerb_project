To further respond to the comment made from SecurityMatt's answer, I don't think exFAT was really designed to be a very "modern" filesystem filled with modern design features.  It was designed to be more modern than FAT32, by supporting larger partition sizes.  It was basically Microsoft's answer to some limitation(s) that FAT had, and an opportunity for Microsoft to strengthen its claim on owning the intellectual property of a file format, by having a new file format created during a time when Microsoft has learned to be more clear about who owns the technology.  I believe Microsoft intended to market exFAT for scenarios where low overhead is probably more desirable, such as little memory cards like SD cards (or, more applicably, either SDHC or SDXC cards).  I don't believe exFAT was ever intended to be competing with NTFS by  having lots of new/modern features.
As far as I can tell this is not possible. Neither Mac or Windows' built-in disk partition utilities support this and I've not been able to find any external tools that do either.
Again, I haven't researched this as heavily as some other operating systems, and I could easily be out of date about some of the specifics.  Hopefully some piece of this answer is somewhat helpful.
I'm not claiming to be an expert on this, and this is probably the first answer I've posted where I'm hoping I'm wrong...  but I did find this:
