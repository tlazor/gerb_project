I note the resistance of a typical laptop microphone is 1K. I think the solution must lie in getting the correct resistance bridge set up. Your advice would be appreciated.
I also tried adding a 1k resistance to this after the capacitors and also tested with 22K but get the same wavy distortion even when the level is set correctly. The distortion is hard to describe. Its not clipping. Its more like getting louder and softer as if someone is waving a microphone.
Attempting to turn a line level signal into a mic level signal will not provide the best quality. The easiest method would be a dollar usb sound card. Plug and play line level in. 
I have been struggling to find the best way to connect a stereo headphones output (the socket where you would normally plug your headphones into) to a Lenovo G575 laptop microphone input for recording. I have tried various methods and got terrible wavy distortion even though the level was set correctly and there was no clipping. The laptop sound card does not have the option of converting the microphone input to an auxiliary input. I tried the suggestion of connecting each stereo channel to a 330 ohm resister in series with a 1 micro farad capacitor which are wired to the laptop mic input (ring and tip wired together) but am getting the wavy distortion.  
You're most likely to get better results with a resistive voltage divider.    That is, a relatively large resistor in series with the mic. input, and a lower value resistor in parallel with the mic. input.  That way, you can get whatever level of voltage reduction you want, rather than by guessing the impedance if the mic. input on the laptop.
Get a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable like this, cut it in half, solder in the caps and resistors and then use it. If it doesn't work it's only 99p for a cable.
