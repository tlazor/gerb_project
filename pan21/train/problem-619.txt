While creating a subterranean level with probuilder (irregularly shaped rooms and corridors), I was wondering if I should merge all "terrain" meshes into one or keep them as separate meshes? What are the good practices ? 
I'm creating each room as I go and its not hard to create openings and align doors vertices (with progrids) but once I start moving them around (like with polybrush) I'm sure it will soon be a nightmare. I can see pros and cons for both. Separate meshes would be easier to edit, duplicate or replace, probably better performances but at the risk of overlaps or holes because it would get hard to keep connected cleanly. I guess with one mesh you take the risk of having it eat memory and computation time, or having it too big to edit easily.  
I settled on each mesh consisting of a room and all half-corridors going out of it, to hide the stitching and keep it simple. Still I wonder if there's a consensus.
You can also look for workflows to make editing the map chunks easier - like tools that will let you modify your map as one piece, then chop it up on export so you don't have to fuss with fixing seams yourself.
