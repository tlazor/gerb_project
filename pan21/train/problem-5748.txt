After this, for good measure, do sudo partprobe /dev/sdb to force the system to reread the partition table and create the appropriate /dev/sdbN devices. Perhaps this is the step you originally missed and were misled by the lack of /dev/sdbN?
If you've already formatted /dev/sdb without actually creating a partition then you made a minor mistake there (still usable but weird) and you'd want to rebuild the MBR with gparted before partitioning and formatting if necessary.
First be sure the 2TB device has valid, formatted partitions on it to receive the data (skip this step if you've already formatted the drive and just made a typo when mounting):
Alternatively you can just use gparted to copy the partition directly from the source drive to the destination drive, then increase the destination drive partition size to the full 2TB -- this is what I would do.
It appears that you inadvertently mounted the 2TB device itself rather than one of the partitions on it, as evidenced by /dev/sdb rather than e.g. /dev/sdb1.
