Subtraction paradox:  In North-American football, if a runner goes from the 3 yard line to the 4 yard-line, there is a (4-3) = 1 yard gain.  However, if your math teacher assigns problems 3-4 (integers), you have to do two problems.  So in what engineers call an "analog" system, the Result = Stop - Start; but for integers it can be more complex.
A common example I use is centuries/years. We start with the first century on a range of 0-100 years. Or the first year of a century, which always ends in 00. It describes the amount of x that has passed, not the n-th x.
In the UK a few years back we had only a few TV channels, first 1, then 2, they slowly increased to 5: BBC1, BBC2, ITV, channel 4, and eventually channel 5 The TVs typically had 10 numbered slots (sometimes 8). the slots where 0 - 9, we would but the channels into the slots 1 = BBC1, 2 =  BBC2, 3 = ITV, 4 = channel-4, 5 = channel-5. So where to but the video recorder ( a device to record TV shows for later viewing). Well if we use slot 6 and the TV companies finally add a 6th channel, then we will have to move it, so we put it in slot zero.
So in North American football, the yard line starts at "0" which is called the "Goal Line" typically.
Floors (in European countries) are typically numbered with 0 (or G) as the ground floor, then 1 as the first floor above ground, etc. This could easily be compared to a list/array of floors, with floors[0] being ground, floors[1] being the first floor, and so on.
Note that this analogy won't work particularly well in North American countries, as their convention is to number the ground floor as 1. Nevertheless, the visual element of a building and lift numbered from zero could serve as an intriguing example to illustrate zero-based indexing.
