The difference from our last location was we were using an Apple Airport, which didn't have the problem.  The router in this house is an older Rosewill RT-N150.  VPN's can be sensitive to even momentary connection losses.  The Operating System sends an event if it detects a drop in connectivity on a wireless connection.  I have seen the Rosewill router drop for only a second or two, then recover.  The quick recovery means a browser will still work, since it is not using a static connection. The VPN can see this loss as requiring a connection reset, reauth, etc.
My wife experienced this in our new house (Spectrum), with the same symptoms.  Our solution was to relocate the router closer to her desk and use an ethernet cable.  The problem immediately went away and has not returned.
I would suggest borrowing a newer router from someone and see if that solves the problem.  Also check the channel saturation where you are at: too many SSID's in the wireless AP list can mean that the packet traffic is heavy and subject to a lot of collisions.  This means many retries and more of a chance the connection will be disrupted.
