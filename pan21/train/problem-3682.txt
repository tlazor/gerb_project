After the GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilState = state expression, objects will fully draw in the order in which you submit them for rendering, allowing you to draw objects over others regardless of their actual position in the world.
If you only want to do this for some subset of your objects, draw the world normally first, then set the depth-stencil state accordingly (make sure to reset it to a one that enables the depth buffer before you draw again for the next frame, and also make sure that you always create the state objects in your initialization code -- don't create them every frame, as that is expensive and wasteful).
If, as in your case, you do not want this behavior, simply disable it somewhere in your initialization code. Do this by creating a new state object that controls the depth and stencil buffers and setting the appropriate member to false, then assign your state object to the graphics deviceenter link description here:
Normally when we render 3D graphics, we make use of a depth buffer to achieve the proper visual appearance of solid objects in relation to each other regardless of the rendering order of said objects.
