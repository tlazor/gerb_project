If you stop and start nginx and make sure "stop" really killed the process and /jet/etc/nginx/ssl/cert.crt is really pointing to the new certificate (double check by dumping that cert.crt with openssl, verify that the Validity fields are at the correct date) then there's no way the old certificate could still be used by nginx.
Did you add the Comodo CA bundle to your certificate? You should have received it or a link to it with the certificate. It needs to be added to the certificate file after the site certificate to work with nginx. To test your certificate, use the Qualys SSL Test.
If in fact it is nginx that is picking up the connection, then you have to see that connection getting served by nginx in its logs /var/log/nginx/*.log.
Also, are you sure it's nginx picking up the connection? I.e. if you do a host www.your.site and connect to that IP with ssh and do a netstat -npa|grep 443 there, then the process that you get really is that nginx and not some other proxy (varnish, apache, haproxy, docker picking up the connection etc.)?
If you have a more complex nginx setup it might be that there's multiple configuration items setting up the certificate. So do a grep -r ssl_certificate /etc/nginx. Is the certificate set in one place only or are there multiple sites setting it? Is another ssl_certificate setting being used instead of the one you want?
Also make sure it's not low level packet rewriting or such that is moving the connection somewhere else: check iptables -L and iptables -t NAT -L.
