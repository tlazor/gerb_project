Depends.  If you think it makes you more secure then it increases your risk as you choose to do riskier things with your false sense of security.  If you treat it functionally equivalent to HTTP, then I'd say you are slightly more secure.
The other problem with using self-signed SSL is that many browsers treat self-signed certificates as a major security threat and warn you before entering (e.g., chrome) with a giant red page.  http://www.sslshopper.com/article-ssl-certificates-in-google-chrome.html  This could be a major inconvenience.
Without SSL/HTTPS anyone with wireshark on your network (or the local network of anyone logging in) can trivially listen in and capture username / passwords sent as plain text.
So bottom line is: if you run something that doesn't need to be particularly secure (e.g., no credit card data, no social security #s) and can't afford a proper certificate, a self-signed certificate could make some sense (to say prevent other network users from easily sniffing their login information).
With self-signed SSL they cannot simply listen in, but now must fake your site, potentially alter DNS to do a man it the middle (MITM) attack.  This is still a threat, but significantly more difficult for them to accomplish.
