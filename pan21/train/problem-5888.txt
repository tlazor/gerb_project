While not technically a VPN, TeamViewer is an option (free for personal use): http://www.teamviewer.com also http://crossloop.com both are very easy to setup and have excellent performance. I use Amahi's implementation of OpenVPN which is very easy to setup (also free). I have it running on a very skinny virtual machine: http://www.amahi.org/how-it-works it can also run on a Plug computer...
If you can get a VPN server that uses UDP, for example OpenVPN, you can use UDP hole punching to get through any NAT firewalls to create a connection between the two machines. Have a look at pwnat for an implementation of it, however it only runs on Linux or via Cygwin, so you may need to create your own implementation.
I have two computers (home and work) that I want connect to VPN. Both computers are behind NAT. I have no access to network configuration so configuring VPN server on router is not possible. Is there free service or software that know's how to do that? I use Windows at work and Mac at home.
