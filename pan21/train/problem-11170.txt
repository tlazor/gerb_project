My laptop usually runs under Archlinux / Gnome, but being dual-booted with Windows 10, I could see that the problem also occurs in Windows (latest version, up to date including all Dell utilities), but maybe a little less frequently, I think.
As unplugging the power immediately solves the problem, it could suggest that the power supply would be involved.
I was able, thanks to a USB multimeter, to check that the voltages are almost identical on the 2 USB ports (5.07V on the port where the problem occurs, and 5.08V on the other).
The use of Dell diagnostic tools, whether on Windows or UEFI firmware, has not revealed anything abnormal.
The problem occurs randomly, the malfunction can last a few tens of seconds, then everything works fine again. until next time, which happens very regularly!
This problem only occurs on one of the 2 USB ports (the one next to the power plug), and this is the strangest thing, if I unplug the power to run only on battery, the behavior of the mouse becomes normal again immediately.
I recently noticed a rather odd problem with the operation of my Dell Wireless Mouse WM514p on a laptop Dell XPS 9550 15: the movement of the mouse becomes jerky and its positioning imprecise, which makes its use almost impossible.
