Make sure that you have SP1 for VS2008 installed. and Latest version of ReSharper that supports SP1.
I'd guess it has to do with the extensions you have installed. To disable them temporarily, start VS and click on Tools -> Add-in manager. Deselect all "Start" entries and restart Visual Studio. 
The exception code 0xC0000374 is STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION. This exception's cause may be related to what you were doing at the time of the crash, but it also may be related to something else you did earlier in the same Visual Studio session. The suggestions about disabling add-ons and upgrading to SP1 are good. I suspect that overclocking or faulty RAM could also cause this, but would probably also cause random bug checks (BSODs).
You said that once you upgraded to Windows 7, the problem went away. Windows 7 has a new fault tolerant heap (FTH). If you saw the crash once with Windows 7 and never again, that might be the FTH mitigating whatever bug caused the heap corruption.
Ensure you are running the latest version of ReSharper. There was a known issue with one of the beta release  that would cause a random crash when trying to edit anything related to HTML or CSS or when using the < or > keys. I would suggest disabling ReSharper first.
