Here is the Constraint - It should check to see that there are no current records for that claim that have LastAssignment=1 when it inserts into the table:
A trigger is the proper way to do this. We have a simliar process and when someone sets the value to 1, any existing records that are set to 1 are reset to 0. WHen someone deletes the one that is set to 1, it goes through a chain of rules to determine which remaining record to set to 1 (we must always have one and one one record set to 1). This process is more complicated than a check constraint to handle, thus it is in a trigger (this is the main purpose for triggers even existing). 
I have a feeling it is something silly I am missing but I don't know.  Any help would be greatly appreciated
In a SQl server trigger, you need to be careful not to try to handle only one record at atime. Triggers operate on the entier set of data so make sure to write your trigger to do so as well. A 1,000,000 records might be changed in one update, you don't want to lock up your system while it gores through row by row. So no cursors and no scalar functions and no correlated subqueries.
I have a table that has a flag that can be set to 0 or 1.  I need to make sure for every claim record in that table that the flag is only set 1 once.  So in other words I may have multiple records for one claim and all but one should be set to 0. Below is the table
