Notebook has wi-fi connection to the home router (router's WAN port has public IP = E.F.G.H, and LAN is 10.0.0.1/255.255.255.0). VPN client (notebook) configured in the same manner as the VPN server: Control Panel --> VPN --> Add --> A.B.C.D., user/password, Automatic protocol. Connection is established. To save access to the Internet I unchecked "Use default gateway on remote network". 
The goal is to provide connection from external notebook to the local hosts via Internet as they are in the same local network.
Among these machines there is one with 2 network cards (ethernet). The built-in card is connected to the hub (static IP 192.168.137.1). The additional card (connected to the Internet provider) has static public IP (v4), and this connection is shared in its settings. Let us denote public IP as A.B.C.D and this special machine as SERVER. 
PROBLEM. The goal is not reached. I can not use services running by the hosts. Actually I  can not ping them. 
VPN server is running by SERVER. It is configured in this way: Control Panel --> Network and Sharing Center --> Change adapter settings --> New Incoming Connection. Windows firewall allows "Routing and remote access". Needed A.B.C.D ports (UDP 500, 4500, 1701) are allowed by Internet provider (checked).
