A reverse proxy is a server that looks like a normal web server to the rest of the world, but isn't actually serving its own content.  When it gets a request, it actually asks a different server for the answer, and passes it back to the client.
A normal [forward] proxy sits on the same network as the client computer running a Web browser.  The Web browser must be configured to use it under preferences.  It is normally used to cache websites so that only one copy of the Google logo needs to be downloaded even though you have ten people all loading google.com.  Since they all ask the proxy to download it, the proxy stores a copy in it's cache the first time and serves that copy to everyone else.  A second use for a normal proxy is access control.  Perhaps you want to block certain websites or only allow certain people on to the Internet.  You can set your router to only allow access through the proxy where you have complete control of who's using what.
A reverse proxy sits on the server-side of things right next to the actual web server.  It's invisible to clients unlike a normal proxy.  As far as they know, they are talking directly to the web server.  One use for a reverse proxy is load-balancing.  A reverse proxy can send a request to one or more web servers behind it depending on which servers are running and not over-loaded.  It can also be used to allow multiple web servers to share an IP Address and other more advanced techniques.
