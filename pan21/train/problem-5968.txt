Personally I  do quite the same as John T answered on Nov 9 '09 at 2:47, I've also improved mine according to guidance of his answer, thanks.
Note, I've found that method doesn't work on an older version of sudo, specifically "Sudo version 1.6.7p5":
What John T. said sounds good though, except there still is the risk of finding the password in shell history. What CarlF said sounds better, but if one command fails, the computer will still be running with superuser privileges. 
That comes quite handy with some longer scripts. I mainly make use of these for personal computers of others, that I have to maintain.
You will be prompted for your password immediately, then the rest of the commands will run as superuser.
Setting up sudo like that is dangerous if someone happened to see the fact that sudo requires no password on your account. Unless you know what you are doing, don't do that. I've had it happen at my local A+ Training program with my experimental computer one too many times... -_-
