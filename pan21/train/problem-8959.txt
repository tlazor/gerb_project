HP isn't really any harder to upgrade than any other brands - you said you have already done the graphics and memory... It doesn't matter where you buy from, the CPU is always hard to upgrade!
I have a bunch of four to five year old machines here, I can buy a brand new Celeron system now that is 64 bit and dual core that would outperform them in every way... and the depressing thing is, they would only cost about £150 to build! When you look at it like this, Just because it is possible doesn't mean it is economical or worth it.... If I was able to upgrade for £5-£20, it may be worth considering, but I wouldn't want to spend anything serious.
Quite frankly, as your machine is getting a bit older, you will not be able to upgrade to a very high end CPU simply because it probably isn't compatible, and for the ones that are, you probably will not notice that much of a speed increase.
If I was you, I would look on eBay for whatever the highest CPU is that your board can take and if it is cheap, get it - otherwise, save your money up for a new computer.
