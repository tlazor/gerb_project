For about 10 minutes it continually made a noise which was rather alarming to me. It sounded like the disk was being accessed, it would thrash for about 1 second or two, then pause for about a second, then start up again. It continued even when the drive was no longer being accessed according to Resource Monitor, and indeed even after I removed the device via "Safely Remove Hardware" this continued until I powered it off. I carefully picked the drive up while it was doing this and I could feel a slight vibration as it made the noise. Surely it was the read head moving across a large portion of its range. I also noticed that during the actual thrashing the HDD activity light was not active but it came on during the second-or-so pauses. 
Today I installed an application and copied some data to it, and it is now almost completely full: Windows Explorer reports 34GB free out of 1.81TB total space. 
So is this the explanation? Modern hard disk firmwares now defragment automatically? Does this mean that disk defrag software has now become completely obsolete? 
I run Windows 7's disk defragmenter utility, and analysis reports 0% fragmentation on this 98.2% full drive. 
And so it went like this for a good 10 minutes, me not being sure if my drive was slowly dying. I installed HD Tune and was slightly relieved to see no SMART warnings. I have no means of backing up this much data: It would never be worth the cost. So if it was going to die, the data would die with it.
