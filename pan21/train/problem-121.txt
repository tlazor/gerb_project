You may want to look into Rackspace's Cloud Sites if they support the things you need, as you won't be managing the server at quite such a low level, considering your inexperience.
Normally the best answer would be to choose the one you're most familiar with. As you're not familiar with any of them I can only suggest that none of them would be a wise choice for you at this time for an Internet facing server. You really should do at least some learning off-line first.
I use Rackspace Cloud services now, and you do not only get access to Linux based servers you can also have access to Windows based servers like Server 2003 and 2008. If you are more familier with a windows enviroment you might feel more at home dealing with those.
If you watch the video, you'll see that Rackspace has put a lot of effort into their control panel to make managing their system pretty painless. There is learning curve but not nearly as difficult as learning CPanel on a convential Linux host.
There is no way anyone can answer this question for you based on the info you've provided.  Those are all various Linux distributions with different packaging systems, philosophies, etc., and the best choice will depend on your particular needs.  The only recommendation that I will make is just based on my own experience: I run several Cloud Servers with the Ubuntu LTS (hardy) install, as that is the Long Term Support version, and it's worked out fine for me.
