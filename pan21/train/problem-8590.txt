I import the animations, select one, go to "Editâ€¦" and go to "Rig", select "Humanoid", copy the avatar definition from the character I'm trying to animate (e.g. Robot Kyle), and under "Animations" I will get an error like "Imported file RunBackward conversion failed: Transform 'Left_Thigh_Joint_01' for human bone 'LeftUpperLeg' not found". When I compare the avatar of the character I'm trying to animate with the avatar that comes with the animations, they have the same bones defined, just with different names (which shouldn't matter, right?), so it's not that bones are missing. Using the animation with the default avatar also doesn't work, I get no error but my character goes into the first frame of the animation but then freezes. I've tried this with the standard models Ethan and Robot Kyle to the same effect.
I'm trying to animate my first humanoid, and the animations in the Standard Assets pack (HumanoidIdle etc) work really well right out of the box. However, when I try to use other fbx files, like those in Unity's "Raw MoCap Data" pack, I get errors.
The bones in the animation you're importing need to have the exact same name as in the skeleton you're using.
