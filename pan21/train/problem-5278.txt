Most 100 Base TX ethernet devices today support auto mdix. However I need a device (ethernet nic, router, usb ethernet adapter, ...) where it is either possible to permanently (via software/drivers is not enough) disable auto mdix (by desoldering a pin maybe?) or where auto mdix is not even implemented. But I'm not sure if such a thing even exists. Any ideas?
You do not need to satisfy the requirement on the hardware level. There are platforms which support disabling Auto MDI-X.
I suspect you are looking for older hardware. I'm pretty sure the secondary card in my office desktop (which came out of a collegues junk box) doesn't do auto MDI-X but I don't have the model number handy right now.
For example: Cisco IOS offers the no mdix auto command. Junos offers the no-auto-mdix command. Still, I recommend to look up the specifiation because you may get a device which does not run the original image anymore. Look for a feature navigator on the vendor's homepage.
Go buy some junk at a garage sale or on sleaze-bay. Plenty of hubs (and a few switches, perhaps) were made this way ~20 years ago. Look for a switch to make one port "uplink" (as seen on the right of this picture) and you're probably looking at the junque you want....
The easy way to test is to get two identical devices, plug a straight cable between them and see if they link up.
