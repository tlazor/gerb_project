This has most likely to do with your BIOS settings. You said you formatted the Linux HDD, which would mean there is still the boot partition but it fails to find the OS partition. You should have instead repartition the drive.
The first bits of a boot loader (GRUB) and a boot signature are stored in the first sector of the disk along with the partition table. This area is called Master Boot Record (MBR). To remove the remnants of GRUB, you will have to erase the first 440 bytes of the MBR.
Or, you can avoid the error message by switching the disks (as you did) or change BIOS configuration to make the right disk the first choice.
In my desktop computer I have 2 drives: 1 SSD (windows) and and 1 hdd (linux). I used to have a mechanical toggle switch to select one of them before booting (did not want to have a boot manager to choose the OS from). Now, I needed more storage and formatted the hdd as ntfs, to use it as data storage for windows. The hdd drive is now completely empty. However, if I start the computer, it won't boot to windows, but says something about "grub rescue". Then I switched the eSATA connectors of the 2 drives and voil√°, windows is booting. 
On Windows, you can use the diskpart utility. You will need to first read the partition table and save it somewhere (unless you wish to reformat the disk), then use the clean dommand to remove the whole MBR sector, then recreate your partition exactly where it was without formatting it. (If you fail to recreate the partition exactly as it was, your data will be lost.)
Now I have the same setup as you (Windows + Kali Linux) and I simply switch the order of HHD in the bios to booth from the one I want. No software to install, no messing with HW switches or cables.
So during the boot press the correct key combination to enter your BIOS. (each motherboard has different key combo, look into your user manual). There you will find a boot section and the order of the SATA drives to use for the boot:
