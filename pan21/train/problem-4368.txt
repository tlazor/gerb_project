After that you need to scan the surface in the read+verify mode. That means that every sector will be read and its read speed will be measured.
The last thing is OS itself. Quite often bootmgr is damaged when the compression of the C drive is turned on.
You need to make sure that there is no sectors with >=250 ms speed rate (normal rate is up to 50 ms).
The easiest way to diagnose it - to try another PSU or at least disconnect all other devices consuming power from +12V line.
The next part is that you need to make sure that your PSU +12V power line is stable and current on it is enough for the hard drive. If you hear clicking sound and after that a sound like when the motor is turning off that means that HDD is parking its reading magnetic heads and powered off. This can happen due to the unstable PSU.
Make sure that it is off (in the C drive properties > untick checkbox "Compress this drive to save disk space").
There can be 3 possible issues: HDD surface degradation (bad sectors starting to appear and are remapped from HDD itself from time to time), HDD power issue, OS issue.
