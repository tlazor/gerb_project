Of course, you'd have carefully decouple your graphics from your logic, and make it so that your graphics look smooth and not show that the logic is really slow. 
A thing you could do: if a player is in a chunk, set your simulation speed to a higher frame rate (4 Hz, for instance), while if no one is there reduce it to a lower frame rate (i.e. 0.5 Hz).
And then you could have one computer per chunk that manage the simulation. For that much stuff to simulate, I would suggest you use a very low frame rate, i.e. 1-2 Hz. Your game servers would be somehow all connected together, with a master server that stores data. And you'd need a way for your simulated agents to transfer from one chunk to another (like a mega teleporter bridge or something). 
What you could do, however, is split your world in several chunks (I mean chunks, not shards). You'd have to adapt your world for an agent (AI) to be able to exist in a single chunk at any given time. For instance, you could have one big island per chunk.
