The worst thing you can do, as a user, is to find clever ways to get around this problem.  Everyone is happier when users and admins work together to keep things running properly.
Some RMM software does this.  At my company, we will reboot the machine automatically if the user logged out at night.  If they locked it, we'll nag them until they reboot and remind them that it wouldn't come up if they had logged out.
It sounds like your admins are in control, to put it simply.  Thus the short answer is no.  If you ask IT to change it for you, you will find them less than helpful.... not because they're a grouchy bunch, but because it's difficult to maintain policies for individual user preferences.  Don't ask them to change your screensaver timeout either, they hate that sort of thing :)
I have found a process called "TsProgressUI.exe" and killed that . When I killed it, it restarted the timer and allowed for more time. But i have also have had this expedite the restart process too, so if you feel like trying this be sure to save everything first just in case. Also you will have to have admin rights to do this i believe
Your best course of action is to reboot the computer.  After all, these updates are being forced on you for various reasons, most often security.
I have a suggestion that worked for me. Use Process Explorer's tool to find which process displays this window: it was "wuactl*" for me. Right-click on it and use "suspend" tool: this's mainly for debugging, but I liked the way it kills nag screens ;))
Your second best course of action is to talk to IT about the update schedule.  They might be willing to modify the general policy to do away with the forced shutdown, or modify the update schedule.
