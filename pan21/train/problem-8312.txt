At this point I've tried a number of power supplies, and none of them work, not even the one made specifically for the Pi. I don't know what to try next. Is this power faulty? Could it be a faulty Pi? I've had such bad luck finding a power supply that will deliver enough power I'm starting to think there may be some other issue causing the voltage to drop. 
I've been having trouble getting my Raspberry Pi to work, and I found out that the power supply I was using had only been supplying 4 volts (give or take half a volt). I bought this one from Adafruit, which is made specifically for the pi thinking it would do the trick, but when I plug in my Pi and use my multimeter on the test contacts I'm barely getting 4.5v. Here's an even clearer image of the multimeter. With my previous power cables I was lucky to get past the initial boot up sequence. With this new one I can at least get to a command line, but attempting anything more intensive than launching vi causes it to overdraw and shut down.
