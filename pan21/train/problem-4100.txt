It's easy with a table this simple, but the problem becomes a little more difficult when the table has many columns and rows, and if the distribution of cells with the most content is not uniform or predictable across columns.
For others not familiar with the problem, see the linked super-simplistic example. In this example, it's very clear that the optimal column layout is to give equal widths to both columns. If, however, the longer text was always in the first column, then making that column wider would lead to an overall shorter table.
This is a really old post but I came across it when looking around (again) to see if anyone has come up with a generalized solution. Have you come up with a good (i.e., not manual) solution?
I regularly encounter the issue, and know exactly what you mean. To date, my only solution is to manually adjust the column widths based on a visual inspection of the table. I.e., this column seems to generally have the longest contents, leaving excessive extra space in other columns, therefore, I'll make it wider until it's no longer the one that is extending the overall length of the table.
Maybe I'll try a VB solution sometime. It's an interesting problem. Will be even more interesting if the solution has to handle embedded images in cells, etc.
