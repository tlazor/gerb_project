A table is a defined grid of cells for data and formulas that automatically expands as you add to it and also automatically has the capacity to sort and filter.  Creating a table also automatically adds a named range to your worksheet.
Both are very useful tools.  Try googling them separately or consulting a basic Excel book and you should be able to get all the info you need.
They are pretty separate topics, although with some overlap, so that may be why your difference search isn't working.  It's like if I researched "difference between bicycles and wheels" - bikes do have wheels, but wheels have many other uses.
A named range is just one or more cells to which you, or Excel, have assigned a name.  A common one that Excel adds is "Print Area", if you have used the Set Print Area command.  Named ranges can be individual cells that you've named to make formulas easier to read, e.g., instead of "=A1 + A2" if you've renamed both cells your formula could be "=Expenses + Income", just for example.  Named ranges can also be created for groups of cells.
I'd try googling again.  Searching for "Excel 2007 named ranges" yields lots of results, as does "Excel 2007 tables."
