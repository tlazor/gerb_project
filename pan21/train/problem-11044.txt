The trick is to use MPIO (Multi Path IO) which is part of the ISCSI implementation / Standard. Your server and the SAN agree to use two paths for every LUN. Then the server can, when one path dies, just not use that one.
Yes you should have a second network switch, with the switches cross connected to either other.  Each NIC on your client machine should have it's own IP address.
Before you go down the rabbit's hole of redundant iSCSI connections, you should stop to think about the rest of your architecture.  Yea it's great to have multi-path iSCSI, but if you have only one power circuit, and it goes down, well that extra iSCSI connection isn't doing much for you.  Or if you have only one SAN, same problem.  
Also, it's typically preferable to keep iSCSI traffic separate from the rest of your network traffic; ideally you use separate NICs and switches from your regular network.  If you have two single port NICs in the machines, you may want to think about adding another NIC, so that you can have >=2 separate paths for iSCSI, plus a port or two for regular network traffic.
