My Ubuntu HDD failed today(hardware). I can't mount it, but there are some files which I need to recover before I get manufacturer replacement. Is there any software which will let me scan device itself without mounting it in attempt to find files and restore on external storage?
If your hard drive has failed you're pretty much beyond what you can do with software. Your best bet would be a data recovery company.
Depending on how badly corrupted the filesystem, you may be able to retrieve some files using debugfs. Try opening the partition with 'debugfs /dev/sdXn'. If that fails use the '-c' flag. Then you can use 'ls' and 'cd' to see what is still available. 'write' can be used to recover individual files; 'rdump' can be used to dump directory trees.
Imaging the whole drive with ddrescue might also be a good option - particularly if the drive is just beginning to fail.  Getting an image of it now, before the problems get any worse, will maximize your chances of recovering data.
I tend to thing that most of the ext4 partition may be readable and only those sectors carrying data for mounting failed. I have NTFS partitions on that HDD and able to successfully read them.
If you can still access the drive (it spins up and some areas are readable) you can try some at-home data recovery software (search the data-recovery tag here or Google for an enormous list of options, both free and commercial).
