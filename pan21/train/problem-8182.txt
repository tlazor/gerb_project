I used to duplicate whole slides, e.g. the first slide with the missing word (I usually put spaces or a line there), while the second slide already included the word. You end up having a whole bunch of slides but it's pretty fast. I'm pretty sure there are better methods tho.
Here is a solution that is relatively easy to achieve the animation of changing the text colour of a single word or words in a sentence while leaving the rest of the text as it was.
If you want a number of colours to appear on different words in the same sentence at different times, you will need to use more than two layers and click them all in until you have the desired text effect/animation
Click on the mouse and the new layer with the individual words that have the different colours will appear and cover the other black text up.
Depending upon the emphasis desired, you can accomplish certain effects by inserting shapes. For example, if you wish to underline a word for emphasis, insert a line shape underneath the word and then set an animation for the line. Then, when you click or otherwise cue the line, it will appear and underline the word for emphasis. You can adjust line color, weight, and have more control of how it appears (such as swiped in, simply appearing, fading in, etc.). Still not as great as a single-word emphasis feature would be, but it's probably better than duplicating so many slides or text boxes. Hope this helps!
