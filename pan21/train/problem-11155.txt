Open HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.File\shell\Edit with VScode\command registry in Registry Editor. Edit the (Default) value with your own VSCode full path. So what does this registry value do? It adds a context menu for Python.File file type (e.g. for .py files) which execute Code.exe C:\path\to\abc.py command.
Here E:\VSCode\Code.exe is the full path of VSCode executable. The path can be changed with Registry Editor.
Basis: After installing Python (any version), .py file is automatically associated with python.exe. In the following method, that python.exe association with .py extension is preserved. Because anytime we/users execute .py file with python.exe and this default file association helps to do it without typing python.exe in commands. Also Python files can be visually distinguished with blue-yellow pythons :) So what to do? Just add a context menu (i.e. right click dialog box) for .py file only which shows "Edit with VSCode" option.
Disclaimer: This is a workaround. The following method requires administrator permission to change registry values.
