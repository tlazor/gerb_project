When I test network throughput, it's best to remove as many variables as possible such as disk i/o or CPU limitations.  Here's the procedure I use, which can illustrate the typical max you will ever see in your network.
Adam & the full-duplex guys are right. Also, don't forget that your underlying hardware might not be up to the task of saturating 1Gbps/100Mbps as well. Unless you have a decent RAID config, decent SSDs, or some kind of RAM-based drive, you're probably not going to see those kind of transfer rates for extended periods.
I've never seen more than about 50% utilisation on a copper GigE link but I have seen high-90%s on saturated trunk ports between Cisco switches over fibre.
If you want to use the full throughput of Gigabit Ethernet, you'll need to ensure that Jumbo frames are configured throughout your full network -- or at least on all machines and switches on which you're measuring the performance.
However, keep in mind that a single hard drive's maximum transfer rate is usually 30-40 MByte/sec, which is not close to a Gigabit/sec.
Both these utilities should be available on most modern *nix systems, either preinstalled, via packages, or able to be compiled from source.
This method gives predictable results in a well designed network with properly functioning equipment.  For that reason, it is a good tool to help discover if the network itself or the networking equipment is contributing to the perceived "slowness".
