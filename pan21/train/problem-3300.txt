would make "normal" mappings wait a full 3 seconds between keys but key code mappings only a tenth of a second.
If your terminal is set to use #2, you might be tempted to do noremap <Esc><CR> viw. However, this will make Vim pause any time it receives an escape. To avoid this, you can set an <A-CR> key code and use that in the map; this makes it so that Vim can treat the sequence as different from an escape+character sequence (in particular, the sequence can have a timeout that's much shorter than the one used by other mappings; since terminals send the escape character and the following character almost simultaneously, this can guard against accidentally triggering a key code when you're not trying to).
The solution would depend on your terminal and how it's set up. Unix terminals generally send a meta character or sequence when you hold Alt and press another key. There are two traditional ways of sending meta characters to terminal programs:
The set command itself interprets strings like <Esc> literally (i.e. doesn't convert that into ASCII 27), so you have to wrap it in an exec:
You probably also want to set a very short ttimeoutlen so you don't accidentally trigger this new mapping with EscReturn, e.g.
