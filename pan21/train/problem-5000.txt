I've an LG Widescreen M237WD TV/Monitor. Currently  I use it by connecting to my laptop via a a VGA cable. 
The DVI-I can be adapted to HDMI or VGA, the HDMI can be adapted to DVI, the DisplayPort can be adapted to HDMI and DVI.  Sometimes with an active adapter, the DisplayPort can send VGA signalling too.  You can only use two displays simultaneously though on the nVidia.  Not sure about ATI.
My suggestion, just use HDMI because that machine states that it has a HDMI port. That way you can get great picture and audio!
In the link provided, it shows that all video cards have DVI available, no cards have VGA. You can either get a DVI > VGA adapter, or get a DVI cable and use DVI if your monitor supports it.
This depends on what video card you configure with the machine -- the machine I configured has a an nVidia GeForce GT200 and it features a DVI-I, HDMI, and a VGA. 
I plan to buy the Dell XPS 9000 machine. How can I find out if I can connect it to my monitor using the VGA cable? Do new machines have VGA slots? If not, then can I buy an HDMI-HDMI cable to connect my machine to my monitor?
