When I try to login with my own account, 'parkel', it asks me for my password, I type in my AD-password and I get authenticated to login to the server, the first time I logged in, my homedir was made properly and I was assigned to the groups that were set in gidNumber in the AD; all seemed okay in the world. I tested changing gidNumber in AD, all changes were active right away after relogging. All still seemed okay in the world.
Using this link, I have set up a server that is properly joined to an Active Directory server, but for some reason I can not authenticate to that server with a kerberos ticket on several test-users that I made on my laptop. 
That's when the issues started; after seeing my success, I made two test-accounts in AD, copies of my own AD-account that was working before, 'test1' & 'test2'. I changed to that account on my laptop, did kinit and got a ticket. However, when I tried to login to the server, it's only trying to authenticate with password and no mention is ever made in the logs that it's trying to authenticate using pam_sss, since the local user does not exist, this will fail miserably.
All users on my local laptop have the same .ssh/config and all use the same /etc/krb5.conf; all users are also able to succesfully get a valid ticket from the AD, just by using kinit. However, the problems arise when I try to ssh to the aforementioned server that is joined to AD.
I have checked out way more google searches and documentation than I care to admit, but I'm really at a loss here; I'm pretty sure I'm overlooking some stupid small detail, but I really can't find where I'm going wrong.
I eventually solved my problem by settings the correct values uidNumber, gidNumber, homeDirectory and loginShell in AD for the user 'test1'; apparently when I copied my working user, these values were not copied along with all the rest of the information.
Included is some output from sshd log on the server and my krb5.conf on the server and on my client.
