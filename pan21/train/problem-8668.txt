If you want a device to which you just upload some code and it interacts with external hardware, you might want to look at Arduino (and its clones), this type of device has a microcontroller (not a microprocessor, though the difference is sort of theoretical) on it which does not need an operating system to function. You write your code on another device (e.g. your computer), connect the Arduino, flash your code to it, and voila! it runs.
You seem to have some misconceptions about what a Raspberry Pi is. A Raspberry Pi is a proper computer (as in: it has a processor and a GPU, memory, input and output connectors) which, just like your Windows and Ubuntu machines, needs an Operating System to do anything at all. That OS can be simple or complex, but most OSes available have a default GUI for you to work with (but can be configured to give you a text-based login as well). Then, once you have an OS up and running, the RPi allows you to connect to external hardware using the GPIO, for which it has a range of tools available (RPI.GPIO is just one example for when you'd like to program using Python). This is where the RPi differs from a normal computer - the availability of GPIO pins (combined with 5V, 3V3 and GND) to interact with external devices.
