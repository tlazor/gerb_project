Multiple Map Sets: This could server for having the world on one map set, the dungeons on another, and the houses/caves/etc. on yet another. You could even have multiple worlds (i.e. Balanced, Ruined, etc. like the old Final Fantasies).
Something I would put as very high in a level editor "goal" would be to avoid ANY situation where starting the map from scratch is easier than correcting a mistake in the current map.
Character/Boss/Enemy Positioning and Properties We are probably going to want to set where the player and enemies are in the editor. It would be great to be able to edit their properties on the fly (i.e health, defense, current items, etc). This would also help with testing.
Though, what an experienced level designer would want from a level editor? Requirements? Key features? Things that could be worth the time spent into implementing them?
I'll be likely writing one this year. It will end up having unique design so things turn out on its own anyway.
I've seen this happen with a lot of the tools i write for myself or even in other bigger tools(like tiled) where it is very hard to replace a tile set with a new version of it, or even change the size of the map.
My big wish list feature is the ability to easily make a large map "stitched" together from 'rooms'. Basically a map editor designed specifically for a metroidvania style game. Editing many separate smaller maps by hand and dealing with markup or configuration files for specifying how one map links to another is tedious. I'd love to be able to simply make a huge map but section it off with markup and export it as submaps for implementation/efficiency/etc.
