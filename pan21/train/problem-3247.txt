I'm not sure I know what you mean by obtaining an address outside of IANA as there are no means to do this, unless you mean to simply use a public address without it being allocated to you.  If this is what you mean, then you can use any IP address on an internal network if you control the hardware making the routing decisions.  Connecting to the public internet is another matter.  ISPs filter BGP updates with their customers and only allow them to advertise address ranges that they know are allocated to them, so if you cannot advertise the address into BGP then traffic cannot route to you so, so the address would be useless.
To ensure proper communication on the internet addresses have to be unique. IANA is the organization in charge of  address assignments. 
Just think about it.  When the IPv4 protocol was originally documented, it specified a 32 bit field for addresses.  As soon as that spec was published (in September of 1981), there were 2^32 (about 4 billion) Internet addresses.  The Internet community needed some way to arbitrate their use, so IANA was created (well actually Jon voluntered, and everyone else said "good, I don't want to do that").
You can use any IP address you want. You most probably can't communicate with anyone outside your network. 
How the space is used in a general way is set by the IETF (carving out the blocks for multicast, for example), but otherwise Jon (as the original IANA) started keeping a list and handing out addresses (originally Class A, B, and C later arbitrary prefixes).  When the net grew and the job became too big for a single central authority, the regional registries came in as an intermediate level.  And later, the job of doing the IANA record keeping was turned over to ICANN.
But that original set of addresses from 1981 is all there is or ever will be.  That's why we are running out.  The Internet was a much bigger success than anyone in 1981 could have imagined.
