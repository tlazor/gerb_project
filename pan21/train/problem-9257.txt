1 word.  Samba.  You can indeed run a linux-based virtual machine with samba... and perform 99% of the things you need to in a real "domain-controlled" environment.  Samba4 is still in "alpha" ... but I think it's inaccurately labeled... (it should be beta... as people are starting to use it in production environments).  Samba4 can accurately duplicate most functionality in a Active-Directory enabled domain... Samba3 which is very stable only emulates an NT4-style domain.  Samba4 will even let you use most of the Microsoft Active Directory tools to manage it.  (Including the "Users & Computers" mmc tool)
Yes, you don't need a physical server, Windows Server with just AD DS can run in a virtual server with only 256MB RAM and 10GB Disk.
Really just need it for adding some test systems to the domain and mocking authentication and user lookups. Doesn't really have to do everything a true DC does. 
I need a domain controller in my test environment. I was wondering if it is possible to run a DC service without having a full blown server?
There are also pre-built Virtual Machine images available to do exactly what you're talking about.  (for lab environments & testing & such)
