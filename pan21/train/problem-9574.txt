I'm the opposite of Joeqwerty. I believe that server reboots should be part of a maintenance plan. The longer that a system stays up without a reboot, the more changes could possibly be occurring when you finally do reboot. There's also the possibility that changes that required a reboot could be forgotten and then when the reboot does happen months later, unexpected changes occur.
Here at my company we have a server restart manual that describes the order which we restart the servers, however we don't have a procedure that stablish the perodicity of server restarts.
IMO, I would reboot the server about once per month, which would be normal anyway since patches are released once per month. I reboot after patches are applied regardless of if they say they require a reboot... especially if they're .NET updates. I apply each .NET update one at a time with a reboot in between and thus have never had a .NET update installation error on any production machine. Googling the KB numbers of any .NET update is replete with complaints about them refusing to install or constantly coming back up in the update list.
It depends on your SLA's, rebooting should not be something you usually do, it must be done as part of a Maintenace plan, Emergency or security related procedure.
Not to pimp my blog, but I explored it in depth in a post called "Epic Uptime â€“ Bragging Rights or Epic Fail?" in which a lot of people who are much smarter than me weighed in and swung the general consensus to be that rebooting == good.
