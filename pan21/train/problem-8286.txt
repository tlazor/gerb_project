My question is, if I'm fine with the laptop's build as-is and just want to wipe the "custom content" that a former student has created (BAT for PS1 is fine), what would be the best solution in a modern Windows 10 environment? While I know I could SneakerNet a USB drive with the script, once set up I'd rather do this remotely going forward (PsExec or Enter-PSSession would have presumably been great) but as mentioned, the hurdles are tricky and I just want to make sure I'm chasing the right solution before going too far down one path. So what is the right path?
I've found a number of solutions, but they either appear to complicated (ADK), deprecated (WMIC) or seemingly not preferred by Windows given the number of hoops to jump through (PsExec).
I have about 23 Windows 10 laptops (currently @ 1803) which are used by students for training courses that run for several weeks. I've found that students leave lots of files behind when the course completes including answers/projects/etc for work that an incoming class shouldn't see. As such, I would like to reset these machines to a relatively pristine state.
I know I could do Windows 10 recovery, but that is a bit heavy-handed and also requires a lot of manual work as we have to customize the uniquely named machines. I'd be fine with simply clearing out the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc. folders. I'll leave recovery for "nuke from orbit" cases...
