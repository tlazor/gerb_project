However, if you have a license to TeamViewer, you could use the standard version without integration. As a customer you get access to .msi installer for easier deployment. A bit tricky is to collect the IDs, and the best way depends on both overall configuration and company practices.
Until then, our solution has been to "Design & Deploy" a custom module in the TeamViewer management console and to install the TeamViewer Host on our Windows Devices using an Intune Device Configuration Powershell script. We edit and upload the following script, Install-TeamViewer.ps1, with the custom module Config ID and API key.
