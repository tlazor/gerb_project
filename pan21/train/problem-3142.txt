Click the drag-down menu next to the phrase "Choose your CD-ROM." Select the CD-ROM drive that holds your disc.
Make sure the option "Make CD Image" is checked, then click the OK button. The ISO burning process will begin immediately, and you will be notified when it has concluded.
Click the "Make ISO from CD-ROM" icon in the MagicISO interface window; the icon looks like a CD-ROM disc hovering above a CD-ROM drive. Clicking this icon will open a new pop-up window.
Check the file path next to the phrase "Output file." This designates the name of your finished ISO file and the location where it will be left when the ISO creation process is finished. If you would like to change either of these factors, click the open folder icon next to the file path. You can select a new file path and rename the finished file within the window that pops up.
