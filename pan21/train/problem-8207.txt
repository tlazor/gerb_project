Also, pressing f8 gives me the same results as booting as normal. It is running Windows 7 Ultimate, dual-core Intel i3 @ 2.27ghz and 4gb RAM. I think there is an issue with the HDD, as the "Operating System not found" would lead me to believe. Is this a fixable problem?
I've just had the same problem. It means that there is something wrong with your hard disk. Your PC cannot boot from it and it so is trying to boot from LAN and it fails.
This is a dell studio 1558 laptop. Now, something is wrong with the charger that it won't charge the laptop, but the laptop can turn on and operate properly as long as it is attached. It has been like this for a while, but it's not the problem. My problem is that as of yesterday, It takes several minutes to get past the "dell" startup logo (where is says "f2 setup" and "f12 boot options"). After it gets past, it beeps as normal to tell me about the charger and gives me the f2/f12 options and f1 to continue as normal. I can press f12 to get into boot options and load into my live USB BackTrack 5 ISO, but after "startx" it just stays at a black screen. I can also access BIOS setup, but see nothing that would help the problem. When I boot to the HDD, it gives me this
There should be on board hardware diagnostics, use F12, then select Diagnostics from the menu, test the hard drive, post back any errors
