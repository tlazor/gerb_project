I have an asus u30jc notebook and people hear me very badly when we talk via skype or google talk. I've tried to record sound via standard Windows 7 utility and it records really terrible sound. I tried an external microphone and it works great. I don't know if it is a driver or hardware problem. I have the latest drivers from asus website. How can I solve this issue?
If the mic is that bad, it is probably faulty. A friend of mine has the same notebook and while the microphone is not great, it does the job for skyping.
It's probably just a poor microphone. Built in ones often are - they're typically selected for low cost rather than sound quality, and tend to pick up any noise - drives, fans, typing etc. - coming from the computer. As you've already discovered, using an external microphone - even a fairly basic one - will give you much better quality.
Do what Pitto proposed and try it with a Linux live CD. This is a definitive test for software errors. If it is bad in Linux and Windows, it is simply broken and needs to be repaired or replaced.
Just to give it a last try use a linux (ubuntu's really easy) distribution live cd to do the last quality test and if this fails...
One more remark though: laptop mics pick up all sorts of vibrations, so typing, running fans (high processor/graphics loads) or a spinning DVD in the drive may introduce a lot of noise. Make sure these are not the reason for your troubles.
