Of course this does rely on your being able to change the mx records in dns, though I guess there's nothing stopping you adding some form of port forwarding to redirect connections.  Just be careful not to create loops.
You could do a postfix catch all as mentioned in this http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2003110323024816
If you've got the money then just leave this running once you've fixed your own mail server - it's always nice to have some redundancy.  If not then make sure you have your own server online again before any 30 day trials the service provider may have.
Postfix makes it somewhat hard to completely "open up" the system as you want to. Also, this really won't do what you expect. The mails will be delivered then and dispatching them to their intended recipients will give you a bigger headache than you might expect now.
Pay for a backup mail service, ideally one which can be deployed as soon as you sign up, and then add it to dns immediately.  There are a number of companies providing this sort of service, I've used mtgsy in the past when a client's server failed and it started collecting their emails almost straight away.  GFI have a similar product which is pretty nice, but deployment time is somewhat longer and more complicated.
The most reasonable way to handle this is to issue "postfix stop" and go home. The clients will retry delivery for a few days.
