The reverse tunnel should work. If you ssh with a reverse tunnel from your rpi to your laptop (the ssh connection0 then a port will be open on the laptop so that when you connect to said port of the laptop (either from the laptop itself or another computer that has access to the laptop, it really depends on how you try to set up the reverse tunnel and the ssh service restrictions on the laptop) then you will connect to some host/port  on the rpi side (which very well could be some service of the rpi itself). This all depends on the laptop being reachable from the rpi. If your laptop has a public IP address then you should not have any problem at all.... however, if you are talking about connection to your laptop (or from your laptop with the ssh tunnel already set up, anyway) anywhere, even behind proxies and stuff (as in when you are at a private LAN), then you need both computers (rpi and laptop) on a different set up.
It might sound like an over kill but have you considered setting up a server on a VM provider so that you can access it with your rpi and your laptop so that they can see each other on a VPN? That should be enough.
