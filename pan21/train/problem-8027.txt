I would suggest removing broken packages, reinstalling python, python-minimal, python3 and python3-minimal running something along the lines of:
Second, your problem stems from a modification that was made to your system that should never have been made. python is meant to link to python2 by default (see PEP 394) for backwards compatibility and is provided by python-minimal on Ubuntu (see file list).
First of all, removing Python 3 as suggested in a previous answer is a terrible idea, while it has a slight chance of fixing your particular problem, it is much more likely to create many more since any program depending on it will crash.
Should any of the broken packages refuse to be removed through apt, you can use sudo dpkg --remove -force --force-remove-reinstreq $BROKEN_PACKAGE_NAMES (where you should of course replace the variable with the actual broken packages). BEWARE, this will pretty much uninstall anything so do not attempt to uninstall a package you believe to be critical to your system.
