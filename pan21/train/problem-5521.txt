The computer ran fine - until I do something that utilizes graphics hardware spceifically, be it gaming or watching HD video through DXVA (mkvs in media player Classic Home Cinema). This results in crash to desktop, with a pop-up saying the ATI display driver crashed and had to be restarted, and the occasional hard freeze or bluescreen (where the bluescreen again points to ati[something].sys).
I think that if it isn't heat than the power supply is definitely where to point the finger. a motherboard failure is possible, but less likely, and it's a chunk less expensive to swap the PSU than the motherboard.
My working theory is that I need to replace my PSU. The 5830 crashed after less gaming because it draws rather more power than the 6870. My other theory, which I feel seems less likely, is that the PCI-E port on the mobo is damaged somehow.
Thinking that the... incident.. that led to RMAing parts had also affected my graphics card, I replaced my 5830 with a 6870. And thought I was home free.. until my graphics driver crashed again, although I am able to keep gaming for longer periods of time.
You could take a look at voltage monitoring to see if everything looks fine, but just because the voltages look fine when you check them doesn't mean they won't wander around when it's been under load for a while, causing hardware components to act strange. At least if the voltages are off when you check them, you know for sure the PSU is out of order.
Use a temperature monitoring program to keep a close eye on the machine temperatures. Preferably something that will save logs so that you can see the readings right before the crash. This will properly eliminate overheat as the problem.
