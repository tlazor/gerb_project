So my question, as an ignorant networker, is: is there any Linux distro to do the heavy lifting for me? 
I ask because of the imminent release of the Raspberry Pi, which would seriously jumpstart this idea of mine by allowing for nodes to be the size of a pack of cards, and solar powering would not be that difficult.
I want to create a mesh-net at my school which will, with my understanding (limited of networking), allow me to transfer files with computers on said network (which will be a different network than the internet wireless here at school, I'm not talking about simply extending the existing wi-fi) -- with proper permissions of course.
Of course the nodes would need to be structured so that the network was self-healing, and all of the other good things that come along with a mesh-net. 
My goal is to be able to build a lot (I mean a whole lot) of small and cheap (I mean really cheap) mesh-net nodes to be able to weatherproof and solar power to create a seemingly endless network (limited only by how many nodes I have).
