This may not resolve the issue completely, but it sounds like something is failing to be written by the cache....  
If you've tried with various USB cables, and the same exact problem occurs on different machines, it's almost time to consider that the device is a) broken or b) poorly manufactured, and not effective.
If b), take it back to the retailer and ask for a refund, then use the money to buy a different product.
I had a similar problem on a vista machine where the drive generally worked but anytime I tried to copy a large amout to it it failed, no error message drive just disappeared. I also had problems where when I first plugged it in it would just click click click and not come online.
This is not to say there isn't a software solution (maybe there is), but your ability to exercise options a) and b) is somewhat time limited.  To my mind, this sort of operation on a modern device and modern computer should just work, and the likelihood of a built-in problem in the device increases with every computer it doesn't just work on.
Also try running a checkdisk on your main hard drive, and external hard drive.  Something is failing, and it might be your main hard drive...
I turned of "index this drive for faster searching" and it works fine now. Right click drive, properties/general bottom of page.
