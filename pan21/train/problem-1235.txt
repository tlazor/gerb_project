i simply put only two NS records in my domain registrar dns fields, pointing them to the online dns manager servers.
If you have the dig utility available (you have a MAC or Linux machine or download BIND from http://www.isc.org/downloads/all), the following command will also show the DNS servers that are registered with the ROOT DNS servers for your domain's TLD).
Given this above information, if you perform a DNS lookup for www.cnn.com, the request will be processed by one of these three DNS servers (unless the name www.cnn.com is cached by some intermediate server along the way).  The same holds true when looking up some hostname in your domain, such as hostname.yourdomain.com, the request will be processed by the DNS servers listed from the dig NS yourdomain.com.
Here are some troubleshooting tools you can do to help diagnose the problem.  Use this whois to look up the DNS servers that are registered with the root name servers for your TLD (Top level domain).
Suppose you register domain example.com.  This means the DNS for the TLD com domain needs to have the NS record for example.com to point to the DNS server for example.com.  If your DNS registrar is enom, for example, then enom will take care of getting the NS record to point to their DNS servers, and you will be able to manage the records of the subdomains.  Most registrars won't let you directly manage the NS record of the domain or let you register with them but have your own name server for the domain.
