OR depending on your outlook version, write a simple vba script to check that special folder for an unread message as a scheduled event. If there isn't one alert you.
Basically, it details on how to set a "run a script" rule that triggers a reminder when you don't get an email within a specified schedule.
You could start with creating a rule.  Hopefully the required email has something you can use to reliably identify it.  For example:  it always comes from a certain sender or it always has certain text in the subject line.  The rule could move the email to a specific folder that you can watch for a new, unread message.  There are other options for what to do that can be combined with moving the email.
I think this should answer the question - I was looking for something similar, as I receive a lot of emails in my work from processes that run at specific times, and was looking for a way to keep track of anything that did not come to my inbox when supposed to. 
If you set a filter to alert you when you receive a message, and possibly even move it to a special folder then you can also set a reminder to ask you, if you have received the email you need today. And you would have a visual indicator, if there is not an unread message.
Assuming you get any new message on a regular basis, you could use rules to check that a "got mail from xyz" has been set in the past 24 hours.  Otherwise, the only alternative I see is a custom Outlook add-in (or some VBA macros) that set a timer which goes off every 5 (or whatever) minutes.
