Since your router is Linux, I assume it must also have an SSH server on it. So here's what I do when I need a quick-and-dirty (but secure) tunnel to browse the web with:
Furthermore, you can carry around a USB stick containing your configuration, and use it on any PC...
Looking for the easiest you would use an SSL/TLS solution, which has the added benefit of looking like only SSL traffic.  This is an application layer level solution though.
Looking for the most secure, you'd go with IPsec style VPN. Network level solution, encrypts it all and that is that.
Next, I fire up my FireFox web browser and configure it to use the SOCKS proxy server that my SSH connection has just created at localhost:1080. Also, in the FireFox about:config page, I double-check that network.proxy.socks_remote_dns is set to true, so that my DNS queries are sent over the tunnel as well. (Very important!)
When I'm done browsing, I close the tunnel by terminating the SSH connection. It works pretty well for occasional use, and it should be as secure as SSH.
Finally, as a sanity-check that my browser requests really are going out through my VPS, I browse to whatismyip.com, and verify that the IP address it reports matches the static IP address of my VPS.
I'm going travelling and would like to be able to VPN from a internet cafe to home so I can do internet banking more securely.
