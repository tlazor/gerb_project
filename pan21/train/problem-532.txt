In my case problem was simply - user nagios was not able to execute the script. After chmod it started to worked. Sudo is not necessary. Its even evil :)
Mine was a pathing issue in client:nrpe.cfg, double check the command path to the check_* plugin name.  These can be confusing, (lib/local) (libexec/plugins) as a pathname.  I mistakenly yanked and put the paths from the commented prepackaged nrpe cfg file to make commands.  The make install or yum plugin install puts these in a difft directory. 
In case of custom NRPE plugins, make sure to print some output along with the exit value. If there is no output from the script NRPE will complain saying "NRPE unable to read output". You can enable debugging in nrpe.cfg and observe this error.
From the server I was able to confirm it was not a firewall issue, could telnet to the 5666 port, could run a blanket check_nrpe and get the status as a return value.  Could run the commands locally but nrpe had the wrong path on the client in the nrpe.cfg.
One other thing to check is that if your command is using sudo -u <another user> to run the command, the libexec directory (and directories above it) must be readable by the user being sudoed to.
