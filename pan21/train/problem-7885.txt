You shouldn't have a problem with those power cables (16AWG) -- the amperage draw will typically be lower for 208V power than for 120V power, so there will be less power forced through the cable & less worry about heating.
Re: redundant power and mixed voltages, this depends on your equipment, how the power supplies are connected, etc. -- I've done it successfully in the past and wouldn't expect it to be an issue, but you should check with your manufacturers and go with their official recommendation (that way if something blows up you have someone you can point to).
If you want to be proper and safe you can get appropriately-rated cables from http://www.infinitecables.com/pow_ext.html in a variety of sizes to help keep your rack/cabling clean...
Also it probably goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that you should triple-check that all your equipment can handle 208V power (if it's reasonably modern it probably can).  Plugging a box in and blowing up the power supply is a bad way to discover that it had a cheap one-voltage-only / non-autosensing PSU.
