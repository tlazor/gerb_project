WAMP seems a bit overkill just to host some files... Windows comes with its own HTTP server,  IIS. You can install it using "programs and features", "turn windows features on or off"; there you will see "Internet Information Services". 
Configuration can be done using the provided graphical tools. An option would be adding a virtual directory to your instance, that points to the directory that holds your files. 
If you install Apache by itself on windows, you dont need php or mysql....In my experience apache has been the best thing to host your own files. 
I would like to access a folder of mp3 files on my local Windows machine through http:// addresses. For example, typing http://localhost:9999/songs/test.mp3 into my browser would play test.mp3, which sits in a specified folder on my C: drive. What is the very simplest way to do this?
(Background: a program I'm using wants me to enter the URLs of these files, but assumes they are remote and accessed over http. It doesn't accept URLs of the form file://C/Users.... So, I'd like to give these local files addresses that makes them "look" remote.)
