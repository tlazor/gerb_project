To make printing across the TP-link function, I turned off the NAT in the TP-Link as the ATT wan router was the last hop to the internet and performing the NAT. after disabling NAT a minute later the stuff in the printer Queue of the client on Lan2 started printing on the Cannon connect wireless on Lan1.
Client1(2.100)--wireless--(2.253_lan2)TPLink(1.253_wan)-----(1.254_port1_Lan1)ATTRouter(WAN)--internet.
I have a room, where arrived a new network printer. The computers and smartphones, which is connected to this TP-Link router (with UTP or WIFI), they see the network printer. This room got the internet from an another room, by a switch.
The TP-Link router isolates the wifi and any devices connected directly to it from the network on the WAN side of the router.  It is like a one way mirror, the devices connected to the router can see the outside, but the outside cannot see in.
I had an wireless Cannon MX300  printer 192.168.1.148 on the ATT Lan1 network. I had a wireless client connected to the ATT Lan1 that could print to the Cannon just fine. When I moved the client to the LAN2 side of the TP-Link in the subnet 192.168.2.0, the client could no longer print. The client could access the internet and ping the Cannon on the 192.168.1.0 subnet.
I'm working in an office, which has a messy network built by many people before me. Just to clarify: I far not understand networks, this one either.
I had an internet provider router from ATT/Motorola that supplied the WAN and NAT translation.  I have a TP-Link Archer C7 connnected via the WAN interface to the LAN port of the ATT router(Lan subnet 192.168.1.0). The Archer C7 routed to a wireless LAN (192.168.2.0).
You might try some port forwarding in the router if you really know what you are doing, but I think this is a very technical solution that requires a bit of skill to setup.  I do not know if anyone here will walk you through it.
Resolved  my inability to print to a WAN side printer  from the  LAN side of a   TP-Link Archer C7. I had to turn off NAT.
I had configured the ATT router for a cascade router to point to the TP-link  routers WAN interface 192.168.1.253 so the  network 192.168.2.0 would be accessible from the internet and the local lan1  This will make the ATT Router send ICMP redirects to the clients on the 192.168.1.0 net that want to access the 192.168.2.0 net resources to use 192.168.1.253 router to get to the lan2(192.168.2.0)network. It also allows the ATT Router packets coming from the internet to the clients on lan2 to be forwarded to the cascade  router that connects to lan 2.
However, the other parts of the office, they simply can't connect to this printer. So this room is a totally dead end on the network.
