I think you may have gotten confused by this legacy baggage in the protocol and the similar names, and you were expecting to see WPA2-PSK authentication happening via the legacy-baggage 802.11 Authentication frames before Association, instead of looking for the eapol-key frames after Association.
One common point of confusion is that old-and-broken WEP had an old-and-broken authentication method known as "shared key authentication", and still-good WPA2 has a still-good authentication method known as "pre-shared key" (PSK). Since both of those authentication methods contain the phrase "shared key", people sometimes get them confused.
The 802.11 standard defined a special Authentication packet format, and requires a successful exchange of 802.11 Authentication packets before a client can become Associated (i.e. joined, connected) to an AP.
That Authentication packet format was only used for WEP, which is now broken and deprecated. Nobody uses it anymore. However, the requirement to do a successful Authentication packet exchange is still in place, so everyone does "Open System" authentication for that special Authentication packet exchange, which is basically a no-op: No authentication at all. Technologies like WPA2 end up doing their real authentication later, after Association, at a higher layer (via eapol-key frames, which are basically Ethernet frames, not low-level 802.11 frames).
Although the title of this question might be a bit complicated, the question is actually very simple:
As you can see, the authentication response frame sent from my home router towards my smartphone device is telling that the AP is actually using an Open System (0) as the Authentication Algorithm. The fact is that my router is actually using Shared Key - not the OSA. Why does the Authentication frame contain wrong information about the routers authentication mechanism? Or I am doing something wrong?
