Its a very comprehensive monitor, where you can monitor processes as well as system resources such as memory and CPU. It gives individual output for each CPU core.
In interactive top, switch to individual CPU % by typing 1, then write the current configuration to a file by typing W.  This will create ~/.toprc.  Now, top -n1b will output per-CPU % as well.  You may need to copy the .toprc file and change permissions if your script runs as a different user.
For ubuntu systems, its available as a package in the repo, so you can directly install it via apt-get/synaptic.
With the BSD top, top -l2 -s1 -o cpu will (tested) print out the top statistics twice, order by cpu%.  Just in case there is a BSD top lurking about on your system...
I don't know the right way to do this with the procutils top; maybe echo k|top -n2 -d1.0 does the trick?  Note that the first output of top isn't going to give you useful info on cpu% usage: top only attempts to estimate cpu% since it started running. Hence the -n2.  You can restrict to the second statistics listing by throwing away everything up to the second blank line.
