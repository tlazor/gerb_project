Is it a general digraph? In this case a hierarchical approach may be suitable (more information later).
I was given task similar to yours on my job. I used two things given above. Both the things work and should give you general idea. In the end you will have to do some tweaks that are specific to your graphs. 
A great source for graph drawing algorithms is Graph Drawing: Algorithms for the Visualization of Graphs.
I don't think it is wise to use local search techniques. There are many (fast) methods which work pretty good for many classes of graphs. Of course you can also test local search methods.
Is your graph planar? If yes, there are many good methods for planar graphs (e.g. dominance drawings). 
If you go with the local optimization methods, I would definitely use the initial configuration to start with (since it should be close to a good local optimum).
graphviz contains tools to make attractive planar layouts. the papers used to inform the programs are listed at http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php .
force-based methods are probably the most common for graph visualization but its possible that GAs (more recently investigated for this purpose) are effective & currently underexplored & hybrid GA-force based solutions are possible via force analysis in the fitness function. here are some other refs not cited so far
In my opinion a good first approach to this problem is the hierarchical approach. Check the paper by Sugiyama et. al Methods for Visual Understanding of Hierarchical System Structures (chapter 9 in 1 describes such methods).
