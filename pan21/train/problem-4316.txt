As I took over the systems admin role from another administrator, I would like to know what is the easiest way to find out (either through a third party or  some Windows administrative tool) what settings are carried over if the profile is a Roaming Profile. I tested creating a new user profile for one of my users and it seems basic Outlook settings such as the user's mailbox and PSTs are carried over automatically when I create a new user profile. I suspect this is done through a batch file loaded as part of the login script. However, my knowledge of scripting is limited and I don't want any corruptions to be carried over to the new profile. Can someone share their experiences on this?
Profiles carry desktop settings, shortcuts, recently used, favorites, cached data, desktop and folder customizations, anything that is specific to the user's settings in the registry, etc. with them. In XP, you can see everything that is moved around with the profile from the c:\documents and settings\ folder. All files there are what are compared and used in profiles. You also have menu items that get merged with the local system's start menu items within the profile as well (programs that are installed just for their use, startup items just for them, things like that).
If you have an Exchange or IMAP server, mail is kept on the server, so re-running Outlook on a fresh profile will be a matter of configuring it to look on the mail server for the user's data.
When a particular user is having a lot of problems with Windows XP e.g. applications crashing, unresponsive applications (which used to work), and as a general troubleshooting practice for a domain user, I normally rename that user's old profile and get him/her to logon to create a "fresh" profile (on the same PC). More often than not, this will solve the problem albeit some reconfiguration i.e. Outlook, Excel add-ins etc.
