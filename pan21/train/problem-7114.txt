I have seen a lot of Z-Brush artists use Blender for unwrapping UVs. It seems particularly good at things like creating the seams on low poly characters 
If you are talking about GameBlender ("running games in blender") I like it for rapid prototyping, but not for final products (due to the plugin dependency).
I've never been terribly impressed with the Blender Game Engine (though I haven't worked with it enough to have a strong opinion), but as part of a content pipeline for a game, Blender is great. 
On the con side, many existing game engines don't provide really good exporters for blender, especially the commercial ones (but then, you can always write your own).
I've been using it for nearly 4 years and it's a fine piece of software. It's free, and while the interface is a bit menacing at first, it's very efficient once you get a feel for it (and 2.5 looks like it's cleaning it up a lot). The python scripting API is great, and allows you to automate all sorts of things, write exporters/importers and so on. I've even used it as a simple map editor for a project or two, with a script to export to the appropriate map format.
Blender can be easily extended via python and so it fits in virtually every content creation pipeline. You can write your own custom exporters, or even add your own UI-elements for tweaking game-specific properties. With version 2.5 the UI has got a major overhaul and is much more intuitive now.
