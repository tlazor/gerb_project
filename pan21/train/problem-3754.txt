What can be the reason for this behavior? How can I modify my config so traffic towards local subnet is not send via router?
You should fix your router so that it doesn't send the spurious RIO.  Failing that, you should find which piece of software is changing the value of the sysconf mentioned above and disable it.  But I wouldn't worry about it too much — the redirect mechanism will take care of the issue just fine.
Therefore, the Debian Jessie behaviour is expected: the route information option is ignored, the on-link prefix is honoured, and you get an on-link route.  On the other machine, some piece of software or another is probably changing the value of the sysconf — try this:
The prefix information option (PIO) says that prefix p/64 is on-link.  The route information option (RIO) says that p/64 can be routed through the router.
I cannot find anything in RFC 4191 about whether a RIO should override a PIO or not, so I suppose that the behaviour is RFC-compliant.  I agree with you that it is suboptimal.
It's not that bad.  The first packet to each destination will be sent to the router, which will send a redirect to the sender which will cause it to insert a transient /128 route to the destination, and start sending packets directly to the destination.  Yeah, it's a robust protocol.
First entry is odd. All local subnet traffic is being forwarded via router which isn't very optimal.
On my other machine in the same subnet with Linux 4.7.0 (Debian Jessie) routing table looks like expected:
