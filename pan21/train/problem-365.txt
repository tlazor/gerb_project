So I'm copying the root web folder, and all its subfolders and files, to this new server. I'd like to keep permissions intact. It's also pretty massive - I'd like to be able to compress it before transferring to the new server with permissions intact. Any way to do that? And will the new server being in a different AD domain screw with my plans?
Use the I would probably start by looking at web deploy  I would not reccomend simply copying the files as it seems to me from your descritption that you have a sizeable website.  A tool like robocopy is fine for copying files but could have all sorts of permissions that you'd could spend ages trying to fix from a robocopy.  Webdeploy can create a zip package of everything prior to copying manually or sync the servers.
If you have domain-specific ACEs and you're moving to a different domain, you're not going to be able to do much other than document it and manually intervene.
I'm soon going to be doing a large migration of an old-school web server that serves mostly ASP pages (currently on a Windows 2003 server) to a newer, virtualized Windows 2008 server. This new server is going to be in a different domain, as well.
