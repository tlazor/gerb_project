I think it makes sens to use RAID over LVM if you want to split your disks between a RAID 0 volume and a RAID 1 volume.
This is an old question, technology has advanced and the recommended setup is to use built-in RAID support of LVM (see here for setup https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/raid_volumes.html ), especially if you are using SSD. Red Hat does not recommend the use of RAID 1/5/6/10 with SSD since mdadm will write the complete partition to ensure proper functioning of checksums. This can lead to faster degradation of the SSD, as stated here https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Storage_Administration_Guide/index.html#ssddeploy
the good thing is that you can also still move the LVM Volume 2 logical volumes between raid 0 et and raid 1 volume, by using pvmove command
Raid deals with keeping the bits secure/redundant/fast/whatever and LVM helps you present them in a esasy to use way.
I am assuming you mean Hardware RAID with LVM on Top, vs. LVM and Software RAID on top of LVM. If so, I always advise to opt for hardware based RAID first. Software RAID is just that, while overhead is small, hardware RAID performance will be better 9 out of 10 times. Of course, the methodology will very much depend on your final goal. What are you trying to achieve (performance, protection, etc., etc.)
