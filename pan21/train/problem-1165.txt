for (int i = num_of_queries; --i >=0;) is cute, but it makes one pause for a moment and think whether it is correct or not before moving on. It is better rewritten as for (int i = num_of_queries; i > 0;  i--).
Get rid of these: int pnt_x = 0, pnt_y = 0; they are not used. Actually, the fact that you have these in your code, and you have not seen a compiler warning about them not being used, tells me that you are not compiling with all warnings enabled. Do yourself a favor and enable all warnings so as to have the compiler help you. That's his job.
Declare new_pnt inside the loop, too, and do not initialize it to null. It is bad practice to initialize things when there is no need. It prevents the compiler from giving you useful warnings. When you do this, the compiler will give you a warning that you may be trying to use new_pnt before you have assigned a value to it. That's because your if statement checks for 'X', and then for 'Y', but there is no else clause to handle any other possibility. So, add an else clause and throw an exception: throw new Exception("wtf?")
Your arraylist is allocated once and never changed, (its contents are ganged, but not the object itself,) so it should be declared as final.  Right before you start using it, since you know how many items are going to go into it, do arrayList.ensureCapacity(num_of_points); so as to help it to avoid resizing itself as it is discovering its capacity by itself.
