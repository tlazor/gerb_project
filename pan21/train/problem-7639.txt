It could be that it is the USB ports on the motherboard. We had a similar problem with a particular set of Dells at work. I put in multi-port add-on USB cards in them and problem was solved. the cards were only a few bucks each. 
I haven't had exactly this problem but I have a whole collection of mice around here that are prone to producing extra clicks when clicked.  Replace the sick rodent, everything's fine.  The problem is mechanical, the switch is wearing out.
These are all symptoms of the mouse hardware wearing out. this happens eventually to nearly all mouses, though some hold out better than others; if you want one that will last, some mouses, primarily "gaming" branded, but some others, are rated for some number of clicks, these are generally going to last longer to begin with, but will also allow you to compare them.
when it starts happening to your mouse, you have two choices(or three if you want to count just ignoring it), you can either replace the mouse, or if you want to break out some tools, you can often extend the life of the mouse by opening up, cleaning, and adjusting the contacts for the switch. I don't think this is the exact guide I used when I did this myself so YMMV, but it looks pretty clear: http://www.instructables.com/id/Repair-mouse-with-double-click-problem/?ALLSTEPS
