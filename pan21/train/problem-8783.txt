It all depends on what you are actually trying to do. So you will never be able to get an actuall answer based on vague ideas. The best advice I can give you is to benchmark your applications and find out what they need, where they perform well and where they dont. With this information at hand you can select server offerings with match your needs. It doesn't work the other way round.
The exact configuration depends largly on your needs. In certain situations it might make sense to have a small dual-core system with 32 GB RAM in others it would be totally out of place. Maybe you need a high disk throughput, maybe you just need to store a huge dataset without much speed, maybe you need to crunch numbers and decide to use the highest specs CPUs available and even add some GPUs.
There are various ways to size servers depending on the workload. However, there are some rough categories from which you can choose servers to be build. Generally, you can mix things and build very different servers.
