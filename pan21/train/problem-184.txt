Many viruses and trojans (e.g. PWS Banker OXM) delete the registry keys that are where windows looks for restore points.  It also changes the file associations so you have to first restore all the file assocations
System Volume Info becomes apparent in the C drive.  You need to right click it, go to the security tab, click advanced and continue. Then add yourself to the list (add principal or change owner whichever it gives you based on your OS) (just type in the user name you use at login, leave permissions alone)
Back up your restore points, they have cryptic names or some such. Yeah, system restore is pretty useful, but hate how it deletes older restore points after some time passes.  I almost got deactivated with some stupid update (yes I'm genuine) but you know MS...
Is there a way to preserve these restore points from accidental deletion? Is there any other FREE tool to take snapshot of the image on other disk?
You'll find system restore in there.  You need to gain access the same way, by doing the above again for each folder you encounter.  You'll probably get an error like "could not apply the settings to bla bla bla" (3 times). Ignore that.
I am using Windows 7 Professional. My system crashed few days back and to recover that, I inserted the Windows 7 DVD. While running the System Restore from the DVD, it showed there are no restore points. It shocked me. I created few restore points, where they disappeared.
