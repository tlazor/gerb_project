The amount of data transferred is typically quoted in an absolute quantity of bytes moved - e.g. a 50MB (large B) file, or 50MBytes of data.
The reverse of that formula will give you a rough approximation of max quantity transferred for a given rate cap, which is possibly more useful, but bear in mind that providers that bill based on rate count every bit that goes over the wire (packet, protocol and payload), so the actual quantity of data (payload) you can move is somewhat lower than the raw number would lead you to believe.
That's because the original use for digital communications was the phone system, which used an 8bit ADC (analog/digital converter) at 8KHz (8000Hz), generating 64000 bits per second.  Then, T1 lines aggregated 24 of these voice channels, creating a commonly used 1536000bps implementation (usually sold as 1.5Mbit, but 1.5*2^20 should be 1572864bps).
At the same time, it was easy to sell on individual channels increment, that is 64000bps at a time.  Much later, many newer transmission technologies are defined not in bps, but on multiples of 64k channels.  Confusingly, these multiplier number is usually a binary-round number, so sometimes an 8Mbps can be 128*64000=8192000bps instead of 2^23=8388608.
Network bandwidth is typically expressed in quantity of bits per unit of time -- e.g. 45Mb/sec (small b), or 45Mbit/sec.  This expresses a rate of transfer.
20Gbps and 2000GB per month are both measurements on the exact same yard stick (both measuring amount of data per unit of time) -- it is just that 20gbps is way faster than 2000GB per month.
The caveat here is that the rate you calculate is pretty much meaningless: You could do zero traffic for 29 days, then shove all 50GB out on day 30, and as far as your provider is concerned you're within the limits of your utilization.  Limiting yourself to a maximum of the rate you calculate minus a small margin for padding almost guarantees you won't exceed your transfer cap, but may hurt performance unnecessarily. 
Besides the obvious bit/byte confussion, and the 1000 vs. 1024 discrepancy, there's another little known issue with bandwidth:  
Some providers sell by quantity of data transferred -- this is more common with shared web hosting companies.  You can convert this to a rate via a rough approximation (multiply the quantity number by 8, then divide by the number of seconds in a billing period - 2592000 seconds is approximately one month (30 days)).
while measured throughput is quoted in GigaBytes of throughput (how much data your server sent/received)
Most colocation providers sell bandwidth by transfer rate - You are allowed so many bits per second, and are either capped at that rate or allowed "burstable bandwidth" (with burstable bandwidth you are typically billed based on the 95th percentile of your usage -- use a lot of excess bandwidth, get a bigger bill).
