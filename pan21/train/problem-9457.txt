Teamviewer should be the best option(the fastest one) I see imo. Torrent would be very slow to transfer.
I haven't actually ever tried it for a personal files, but you could transfer the file using the BitTorrent protocol which was designed for peer-to-peer file sharing. There are many free client programs available like ÂµTorrent to use. The documentation for the latter discusses how to create a private torrent file and send a link to it to someone else for sharing. There are also many tutorials on the web.
You can setup a FTP Server using Filezilla and connect to it from any other PC/Mac/Smartphone...this is the easiest way to transfer files between your computer over the internet..an alternative would be to use Dropbox and put the files in your Public Folder and copy the URL which can then be used to download the file
You also could query IP from Websites like http://www.wieistmeineip.de/ but there are many problems with forwarding the adress/port through the router and your firewall.
