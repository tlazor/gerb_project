Known "good" sources can be compromised.  Documents on a "known good" site can be compromised.  There are likely many vectors.  If you are very careful you may avoid issues but I would suggest why take the chance.
You didn't mention Windows updates or updating your other apps.  Those two things are VERY important.  You should make sure Windows is always up to date.  Microsoft will push fixes for security vulnerabilities regularly.  Another good free utility is Secunia.  It will check all your installed apps regularly and make sure the latest version is installed.
I'm not sure that you use the USB or not, if you then its very important that you should have an AV on your system.
I honestly think that you do need an antivirus because you will never know, there are bugs, viruses & spam going around the web. So better safe than sorry, Imagine if you were to loose all your information because your PC got attacked by a virus. 
All of these answers assume that antivirus is going to make a huge difference.  As said above there are exploits that your antivirus won't stop.  
If you're concerned about the cost, just install Microsoft Security Essentials. If you're not concerned about cost, stick with something free.
I'll personally recommend you the antivirus. You told that you download the stuffs from only "Good known resources" but there are no guaranty that you are not under attack.
There are lots of hackers in world, who every minute makes and spread millions of new viruses. The main purpose of those hackers is to hack and collect your secret information. If you are plugged with the "Internet" then no one can say that you are not under attack. There are many type of the hacking that hacker used and one of them is known as "Phishing" which can hack your "Email" password if you are not aware about it. Thus AV are the program which alerts you on these kind of hacking situations.
