re: using DFS and file replication to replicate the files but referring to them with their local drive letter: I get the feeling that you might be looking at using domain DFS replication to handle the replication, but then you'll refer to the files via their local drive-letter and path. That will work, too. The same caveats apply re: the files being updated frequently, but there's no concern about the files being accessible with a UNC path.
I've long since let my Citrix certification lapse, and I haven't worked with Presentation Server 4.5 at all, so take my with a grain of salt here.
If the files are just static read-only files (or, seldom-write files) and can exist on at a UNC path you're probably fine to put them on a replicated domain DFS share.
Assuming that the files are alright to access from a UNC, in general, hosting them on a domain DFS share w/ replication (either FRS or DFS-R-based) ought to be fine, in principle. If the files are frequently updated by the software (I don't know what the files are and whether they're accessed in a read-only or read-write fashion) you may have concerns re: excess replication traffic being generated.
