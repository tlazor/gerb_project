Personally, I think ECC is a bit cargo-cultish, but it's a reasonable insurance policy on a big beefy server as long as the cost premium isn't too high.
But no matter what you decide, I recommend running MemTest86+ overnight (or long enough to make several passes over the entire address space).  And if you can turn up the heat (literally), that'll give you an idea on how your ram will perform when the system is running hot.
I've had brand-new RAM exhibit errors in MemTest.  I've also had "good" ram develop errors, over time, that MemTest detected.  It's a great tool, and one of the first things I run on a new system.
I can't find a definitive source on the internet, other than nebulous claims of one bit error per month per gigabyte, which is patently ridiculous; servers would be crashing left and right all over the world if this was remotely true.
I would consider ECC ram for "mission critical" applications.  If a server error would cause you to lose significant amounts of money (or kill people, or whatever), spring for the ECC ram.  Basically, weigh the cost of the ECC ram versus what you stand to lose in the event of an error.
We've considered it for critical systems. One problem becomes, how the heck do you do error detection in software to check your memory integrity, when the program used to run the memory integrity check can itself be prone to memory errors??? You basically can't and it makes failure mode analysis / failure mitigation difficult, so ECC is a mitigation mechanism.
