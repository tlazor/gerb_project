One of several key practical differences between these unicorns and most other orgs is the level of automation they employ.  It is very difficult to automate the quality checks needed to maintain a constant flow of work from DEV, through testing environments, to Production.  Development and Operations must maintain high service levels internally.  Ops must provide self-service resources so developers aren't waiting on tickets to get new infrastructure.
How can other software companies deploy software thousands times per day, what is stopping them from doing so today?
Companies such as Amazon, Etsy, Google, Facebook and others are publicly saying they deploy software thousands time per day.
The "how" of extremely high-frequency deployment is all about very mature engineering practices and tooling.  The "unicorns" (Gene Kim's term for the type of company you list) have some of the best talent in the industry, and invest in the best technology.
This usually include tooling for code review, code linting, unit testing, orchestration, configuration management, integration testing and a strong culture for the change.
Frequency of deployments is one minor update on most business days, one major update on a weekly basis.
These big companies are using unconventional solutions, such as the BitTorrent deployment system and geographically distributed content delivery networks (CDNs). When Facebook updates its code or generates a new build, the binary files needs be pushed to all of the company's servers (~1.5GB), so they created its own custom BitTorrent tracker designed to obtain data slices from other servers that are on the same node/rack which reduces total latency.
