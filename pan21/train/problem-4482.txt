Windows marks the suspected corrupted volume with a "dirty" bit, you could have a hard drive failing, I suggest you back up your Important data Now.
Most common are logical errors in the file system, bad sectors on the hard disk, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors. Viruses could very well cause chkdsk to run as well.
Also, incorrectly shutting down your PC can activate chkdsk to start the next time you boot your laptop.
3.) When MBAM is done install SAS free version, run a quick scan, remove what it automatically selects.

1.) Make a boot AV disc then boot from the disc and scan the hard drive, remove any infections it finds, I prefer the Kaspersky disc myself. The New 2010 Kaspersky disc can update the AV dat files if you are connected to the internet at the time of scan and is suggested to update before the scan.
These last 2 are not AV softwares like Norton, they are on demand scanners that only scan for nasties when you run the program and will not interfere with your installed AV, these can be run once a day or week to ensure you are not infected. Be sure you update them before each daily-weekly scan.
So, the last 4 times I booted my laptop, a disk consistency check (chkdsk) got launched twice without errors found. It made me wonder what could be reasons for Windows to schedule a chkdsk. Anyone? Please name anything you can think of.
Install free MBAM, run the program and go to the Update tab and update it, then go to the Scanner Tab and do a quick scan, select and remove anything it finds.
