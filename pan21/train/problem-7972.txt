First I tried to connect to the machine with the auto assigned IP with no luck. Then I attached the previously created elastic IP same results. Amazon "built in" status checks are green.
Is there any extra settings what I have to enable / create / pay to be able to run instances? Or is there any limit what I have to increase (I think I have default limits for everything)
I am new in AWS. I have a few running EC2 instances in Virginia without any issue. Those where created mostly by previous sysadmin I only added 2 extra machines. Now I decided to start a few VMs in Ireland as well, but at the end of the process I can not reach them (ping, ssh etc).
I am running several VMs in Ireland with elastic IPs and never had issues, except when the security rules were misconfigured (read: my local IP changed and I could not connect anymore).
The security group has settings for inbound and outbound traffic. Did you perhaps only allow outbound traffic to all IPs for all protocols and forgot to enable inbound traffic?
