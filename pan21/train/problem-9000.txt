Just picked up a Dell PowerEdge R720. I created a virtual disk with the PERC H710 Mini BIOS Configuration Utility 4.03-0002 and configured it for RAID 1.
You should be using the LifeCycle Controller to install the OS, which will include the appropriate drivers for your RAID controller.
Lifecycle controller is the way to go.  I mount and OS ISO in virtual media in iDrac8 then boot to it after setting up OS deployment in Lifecycle.  It will then recognize the drives on the raid controller.
I've tried downloading drivers from Dell but they only come as .exe files which I can not run when I am in the middle of trying to install Windows.
Even when installing with the Life Cycle Manager you need drivers and those of us using this as an ESXi host and installing through vSphere don't really have that option.  I think this link will provide you with what you need.  As you mentioned you DON'T need the exe files.
When I then go to try to install Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit the virtual disk I just created fails to show up and it doesn't show any drives in which to install Windows Server on.
