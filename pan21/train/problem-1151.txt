However, in the real world, enterprise wireless vendors often push more functionality to either the AP itself and/or tie them into a controller, with the end result that they often incorporate functionality from higher layers as well.
As for #2, yes, an AP (or any bridge) needs to keep track of which interface any individual device is connected.  In general (and simply), they work on the principle of frames destined to an associated station gets forwarded out the wireless interface and any other frames get forwarded out the wired interface (or sent to the controller).
I am just learning about L2, but I think whether "Ethernet" AP hardware uses MAC tables or IP addresses to determining routing is a moot question. The point is that an Ethernet network establishes a unique correspondence between the MAC and IP address, so in principle an AP could route based on either. Hardware that routes on MAC however could be more flexible, for example in setting up "transparent" bridges connected to LAN endpoints. 
I don't entirely follow #1, but neither the connection to a switch or router nor the use of CSMA-CA has anything to do with their function as a L2 device.  It is a L2 device because that is the layer of the network where it is designed to function.  It doesn't care nor need L3 or above to operate and allow devices to communicate (again strictly speaking).
Strictly speaking, access points are a L2 device.  Their primary function is to bridge 802.11 WLAN traffic to 802.3 Ethernet traffic.
