Is there one of the 4 companies that he works for "the most?"  i.e. which one pays him the most?  He could have an assistant there who maintains his master calendar and who either polls his other calendars for conflicts or who is the only one who can officially book him and people at the other company have to coordinate with that assistant.
Or VPN connections from each of the "other" companies to his master calendar...  the possibilities are endless and horrifying!
You can share free/busy data across Exchange organizations using Active Directory Federation Services. This will require ADFS endpoints at all organizations, but it will do what you want. Of course, whether or not you can convince three other organizations to buy into this is probably not going to happen :)
Another possibility would be OWA.  Exactly how to set it up depends on what the workflow is going to be, how many people would be able to book appointments for him...  You could have a single master calendar that a few people (one in each of the 4 orgs) can access to check his availability.  Or you could have one calendar in each org and people are required to check all the others before booking him in their local system.
I think mfinni's comment about a single human assistant to keep it straight would make the most sense...
