Mac addresses are only relevant in local networks, they don't pass over what you commonly think of as the 'internet' and so it doesn't matter. Infact, a lot of devices will spoof addresses, which may match other devices which are also spoofing the same address. As long as they aren't in the same broadcast domain (lan, basically) there's no issue.
For reasons like the above, most network cards can have their MAC reset in software. That is can be done doesn't mean it is a good idea to mess with this.
This "address spoofing" was commonly used if you had a machine connected to an external network, not under your control (think early ISP), which registered the MAC address of the machine (really, network card). If the card broke, it was much easier to get a new one and set it's MAC to the old one's than work your way through the bureaucracy of the ISP. Ditto for a new machine.
Some software packages used to be keyed off the network MAC, if that changed, the package supposed to be a pirated copy and refused to work. Again, the solution was to change the MAC. The "official" way of going through the vendor wasn't worth the hassle.
The Sun SPARCstations could have several network cards installed, they all got the same MAC assigned (essentially a machine identifier). As long as the different interfaces were connected to different networks, no one was the wiser. Again, it was possible to assign MACs at will.
It won't break anything unless the server with the spoofed mac address is connected in the same broadcast domain as the 'attacker'.
