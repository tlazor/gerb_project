Every so often I like to do a full reinstall just to get a fresh start on my computer. I was thinking that it would be a good idea to make an installation of Windows 7 only with drivers for my computer and all the latest updates so far on a separate 'clean' partition of my main drive.
I ask because if I have my current installation activated, and I then activate the clean installation installed with the same license key, would that somehow deactivate my current installation, or will activation not go as far to know the difference and accept things as they are because both installations are using the same license key on the same computer?
The idea is that when I want a fresh installation I could just clone the clean partition and then manually install whatever I need at the time on top. This would save me from installing from the disc, installing drivers and downloading a ton of updates each time I want a fresh start.
I want to know if I have to activate the OS on the clean partition to install updates for it, and that if I activate it, will it cause problems with other Windows 7 installations existing on the same drive?
