This shader can make mesh geometry partially or fully transparent by reading the alpha channel of the main texture. In the alpha, 0 (black) is completely transparent while 255 (white) is completely opaque. If your main texture does not have an alpha channel, the object will appear completely opaque.
Additionally, the alpha channel of the main texture acts as a Specular Map (sometimes called "gloss map"), defining which areas of the object are more reflective than others. Black areas of the alpha will be zero specular reflection, while white areas will be full specular reflection.
Unity's documentation for the "Transparent Bumped Specular" shader/material-type is simply a concatenation of each of the descriptions for its Transparent and Specular Shaders (and also Bumped, but that doesn't apply to the question):
According to the way the documentation lays out the single alpha channel for both specular and transparency you are correct in your assumption. 
If you want full control over the textures my solution would be to separate your tire and rim-hubcap models so you can texture each individually. This would allow you to create a Transparent Bumped Specular on the rims for the cutout and shine control but also allow you to use a Bumped Specular on the tire wheel so you can get a more rubbery look without the transparency.
Warning: Not a unity user, so I wouldn't know if unity offers these techniques. The concepts are simple and applicable regardless. (And this just got bumped)
