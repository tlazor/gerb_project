That seemed to work, until I had to reboot again. Now I can't see the files using Partition Explorer, and the Resize button is now disabled.
Because I this computer had no access to the Internet, because it couldn't boot, I was unable to take advantage of any online service. I had to stick with a physical media such as a CD-ROM. I ended up buying Partition Commander 10, which luckily has a new feature of being able to repair the MBR and partition records. It worked.
Then I rebooted the system again. This time, I got a message saying "INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE". I went back in to SC7 and to Partition Commander, and it was still saying that the partition was unformatted but the Partition Explorer still showed the files on the system. I finally decided to resize the partition again, figuring that this would force a rewrite of the partition information. 
I have a system that was originally had Win NT. I added System Commander (SC7) and then added W2K. The relevant partitions are:
Start from scratch.  Assuming you have a backup, delete all the partitions, then re-create them and restore files from backup.  If you don't have a backup, rescue what files you can (using various tools freely available or using a recovery service) and then rebuild the partitions from scratch.
D: was getting full. It needed room for virus definitions and Windows upgrades. In the past, I had simple used SC7 to resize D: without problems. So I did it again this time. However, upon finishing, I got the message "Unable to create partition". It also marked the partition as unformatted. I checked that the files on the disk were still there using SC7's  Partition Explorer, and they were there. I continued and the system managed to boot up fine anyways.
