2607:f750:0:3f::f59 is an abbreviated human-readable representation of an IPv6 address.  The full human-readable representation substitutes zeroes for the ::, and is 2607:f750:0000:003f:0000:0000:0000:0f59.  Each part of the address is very simple.  It's a 16-bit number in hexadecimal form.  There are eight of those, totalling to 128 bits.
The most significant bits of this address place it in the so-called aggregatable global unicast portion of the IPv6 address space.  That means that it is not a link-local or host-local address, and is not a broadcast or multicast address.
The most significant 12 bits identify a portion of the address space allocated by IANA to ARIN.  The next 20 identify a subset of that space allocated in turn by ARIN to Distributed Management Information Systems, Incorporated (i.e. Pavlov Media).  The next 32 indicate your particular subset of that, and the final 64 bits (0000:0000:0000:0f59) are an interface ID that denotes one individual network interface.  
In dotted-decimal-octet form, this would be 38.7.247.80.0.0.0.63.0.0.0.0.0.0.15.89.  But IPv6 addresses are not conventionally presented in this form.
Pavlov Media telling you that you are assigned 2607:f750:0000:003f::/64 (if that is indeed what it told you) means that all valid combinations of the bottom 64 bits are assigned to you.  The top 64 bits of your (non-local unicast) IPv6 addresses must be that prefix.  Congratulations!  You can put more devices on your LAN, and give them IPv6 addresses, than there are Ethernet cards in existence.
