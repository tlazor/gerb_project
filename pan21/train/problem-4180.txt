On the incoming side, we run Postini to filter all incoming spam, with some Spamassassin locally to catch the rest that Postini misses.
Is there anything I am missing that should be set up to maximize the deliverability of our messages? Can we work with any of the big "whitelists" to help with this? What do the "big" mailers use? I have some thoughts but wanted to check with the experts here. 
My non-profit association has an Exchange server and a ListManager server to handle announcements to our members (about 800 email addresses) and several low-traffic discussion listservs. 
There is an issue where some of the mails we send out via our ListManager install are being flagged as spam in Postini, whereas some others get through. There doesn't appear to be a rhyme nor reason to which one it blocks and which it allows through. My guess is that we are right on the "threshold" of spam and some terms we use in the emails push it over the edge. 99% of emails are accepted by the server, but I suspect some services are silently throwing the messages out or placing them in spam folders.
