This is my partition table. Here Windows 7 is the C:/ of windows 7 and others and softwares is E:/ and F:/ respectively. 18 GB ext4 is ubuntu 10.04 primary partition. The free 42 GB was my D:/ drive. I have deleted it for the installation of windows 8. But the setup of windows 8 says can't create a new partition and a error code while selecting new option. When I tried to create simple volume in windows 7 it tells "not enough space in disk". What is the pro
First, your screen shot has been reduced in size to the point of illegibility, and therefore near uselessness. The one thing I can take away from it is that most of your partitions are logical partitions. If you try to create a new primary partition, this will require resizing the extended partition that holds the logical partitions, and possibly moving one or more logical partitions, depending on where the available space is.
Overall, I recommend that you try using GParted for this. It's got a better user interface, IMHO. You can also create NTFS partitions in GParted. If you intend to install Windows on such a partition, it must be a primary partition, so you may need to deal with those primary/extended/logical distinctions.
