I do dislike the idea of coercing a junior staff member into running an OS against their will but perhaps some gentle suggestions from senior staff could be enough to inspire a migration, as it was in my case.
The daily act of interfacing with any OS brings with it an increased comfort with and knowledge of the particulars of its underlying components. Splitting time between a personal and a professional OS also split's one's attention, and integration issues between the two can also lead to the same loss of productivity that moving to Linux can bring.
Speaking from personal experience, I think that any new *nix admin would be well served by installing Linux on their desktop (and router, ipod, xbox, toaster, whatever). I started my Linux administrator career as a Windows-running, Putty-bound admin and I learned much during those times. However, after repeated cajoling by some senior *nix admins, I switched over to a Linux desktop and my knowledge and understanding of that OS bloomed much more quickly than before. This knowledge was often gained through struggle, as in running bleeding-edge kernels to get barely-supported laptop hardware to function correctly, but the insights that such experiences provided into the particulars of the Linux kernel and the various core subsystems were invaluable to my growth as a *nix systems administrator (eg - the transition from adequate to competent).
