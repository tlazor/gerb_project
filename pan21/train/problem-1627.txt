It really depends on the type of conference AND your job responsibilities.  I Googled the "LISA" conference, and if your job requires you to mainly manage client installs (...and day-to-day workstation operations), then I see a pretty good reason why you'd want to attend these kinds of conferences.  You could make the business case of attending these types of conferences towards gaining first-person knowledge of new and updated technologies that could potentially be cost effective for your organization.
Ultimately, though, like the benefits of automation and comprehensive testing, if your boss doesn't "get it", it's probably easier to find a job that does "get it" rather than try to radically mangle your company culture.  You can change your company, or you can change your company -- and often one is a lot harder than the other.
I found a good list (from here)of reasons why someone might want to attend any kind of technology conference, they might help you come up with a good case for it:
In many ways, if your employer doesn't inherently understand the benefits, you're kinda screwed.  As you say, the hallway track is the best bit, and the energy and motivation you get from attending is almost impossible to quantify (but is easily felt).  What you might want to do is try to identify the benefits to the company of the things you mentioned in your question (talking about Puppet, Nagios monitoring) and rattle those off to the powers that be.
