The most effective tool Ive ever used for recovering files from a screwed drive is R-Studio. It's worked for me even when the partition table was damaged and couldn't be reliably rebuilt.
I know this is an old thread, but for others that might be looking for help: in with photorec is a tool called 'testdisk' again, it is a misleading name, but it is a full recovery tool. When filestructure problems are at hand and not just deleted files this will be a lifesaver. It includes some powerful partition recovery and rebuilding options, but be warned: read the manual! If you don't understand what you are doing, go to a professional or you can make a bad situation worse. Here are some recovery scenarios test disk can help with: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/Data_Recovery_Examples
Have you tried Get Data Back? It's probably your best option. If that doesn't work, I think you'll need to take it to a data recovery place.
I've used Photorec (http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) in the past to do this with a mangled file system. Despite the name, it will recover all kinds of files from damaged partitions, including photos, Office documents, and so on. However, it won't recover names, or directory structures, so you might want to treat it as a last resort before shipping it off for professional recovery.
And not to tell you something you already know, but backing up is imperative. It's a pitty it wasn't done this time but you should make sure it's done on all of your machines now.
