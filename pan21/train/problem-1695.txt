If the DB service is on the same system, then you'll need to account for that. If you are using MySQL, a friend of mine wrote MySQLTuner. While certainly not a be-all-end-all, it will give you a starting point for adjusting your MySQL configs to fit your memory constraints.
With MySQL/Apache, you'll need to ensure you let those run at a normal load for a day or two so that memory utilization stabilizes to what you would consider a normal production level. You'll also need to monitor the system as time goes by as changes to your code and increases in traffic will have various effects in your resource utilization.
Yes. You have to ensure the services are configured such that if they do get flooded, your system's resources (CPU, memory, etc) won't be overcommitted. Since you're using mod_security, I assume you're running Apache and MySQL. 
All of this is less security related as it is service availability related. In most cases, security isn't that hard. Keep your stuff patched, use good passwords, don't stress out. More times than not, it's going to be the brute force stuff that kills you and with proper resource planning, that can be mitigated to some extent.
For Apache, you'll want to look at the average memory utilization for each Apache process. Adjust the MaxClients setting so that...
