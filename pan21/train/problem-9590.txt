You are bound to find that running all of these on a single server is debilitating and painful with only 1 GB of RAM. You should probably consider using something like virtualbox on your PC or laptop so that you can get some more ram than that offered by the AWS free tier. I'd say you want at least 4 or maybe 8 GB of RAM. While this probably can be done, I don't recommend it. You may have to stop one service to run another which then makes it difficult to have one talk to the other (eg, ansible talk to Jenkins while puppet is running, for example.)
Using Docker/K8's, which it seems you want to learn as well, you'll be able to run all of the other tools that you want to learn as containers on that one host which should have enough grunt to allow you to play around.
The good news for your question is that all of these tools can be played with on one free tier instance in AWS.
The Azure free trial gives you $200 in credit for the first month which is plenty of capacity spin up many VMs of an adequate size to run all the tools you mention. I would advise not starting the trial period until you have a good plan of what you want to do, to get maximum benefit from it. 
While the issue with puppet not starting can be overcome by editing /etc/sysconfig/puppetserver and setting something like:
You can use 2 instance in  AWS free tier if you want to practice as client and Server configuration. When instance is not required shut it down.
You might not be able to get this done on the free tier. Puppet for example isn't going to want to start because of the RAM limitations. The AWS free tier uses thje t2.micro instance which only has 1GB of RAM. Your operating system alone probably needs 512 to run at idle. This leaves you a mere 512 MB or ram for all of the things that you listed.
