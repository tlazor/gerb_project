I need to maintenance some computer and I want to see which software is outdated. Ideally it update the software automatically. I have look for a package manager for Windows. I found a large list.
Npackd can install, remove and update software. It does it all without requiring from you to click through the installers (there are some exceptions). There is the default database (called repository) of applications with over 200 up-to-date packages, but you can define additional repositories with your own applications.
Most of this package manager need to update the database manually. The result is that the software database is outdated. 
Ultimately, your best bet is to use Microsoft Update to check for OS security issues and patches (second Tuesday of every month is patch day), the hardware vendor websites for updated drivers and firmware, and your application vendor support websites for the software you're running.
Windows is not really built with this type of thing in mind, especially for the server side of things.  It's a highly distributed system where application developers do not communicate with each other.  Software packages do not have a uniform installation mechanism (one of several methods are used) so constructing a universal installation system would be difficult at best.  Additionally, most EULAs explicitly prohibit redistribution of software, so a centralized DB is often impossible without violating copyright.
