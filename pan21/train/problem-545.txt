I'm assuming that you are speaking about the "identification" field in the IPv4 header and not about some TCP-specific field.
1) If you want to know if different fragments of the same fragmented IPv4 packet have different "identification" values:
Because a TCP implementation is totally free how to calculate these values, a receiving computer must assume that the "identification" values of two TCP packets are "totally different" (as you call it).
However, if I understand RFC 791 correctly, some layer-4 protocol may use the "identification" value to check if packets are lost. In this case the specification of that layer-4 protocol may specify that the "identification" field must be incremented by 1 for each packet.
RFC 791 says that the layer-4 protocol is responsible for selecting "unique" "identification" values and that it is up to layer-4 how these values are calculated (e.g. increment by 1).
2) If you want to know if a router is allowed to change the "identification" value of a not-yet-fragmented packet when fragmenting it the first time:
To save computation time, a TCP implementation on a little-endian computer might increment the value 1 but don't swap the bytes of the value. This would result in the following sequence:
In the case of TCP the TCP header has additional fields - "Sequence Number" and "Acknowledgment Number" - which are used to check where in a TCP connection a certain packet belongs.
No. RFC 791 (IPv4) says that different fragments belonging to the same IPv4 packet are identified by having "the same" "identification" value.
Because these two fields can also be used to detect duplicate packets, I doubt that TCP would even evaluate the "identification" value of a packet received.
RFC 791 does not explicitly say that a router is not allowed to change this field. But it says that the layer-4 protocol may evaluate the "identification" value. This implies that the "identification" field must pass routers unchanged.
