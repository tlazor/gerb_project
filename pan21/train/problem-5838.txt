I had them on a shelf, to be used as emergency "backup workstation", but the reliability of the "backup" is also a very important matter.
As US Marines usually say: " You have been WARNED!", and it's last time they say somethingh before they shoot you.
Within months from startup, all three workstations behaved in the same way: the status turned to " a failure is higly probable in the next 24 hours.
EDIT: The HD is doomed! You MAY be so lucky to have the time to "image" it and then replace with no data loss. Please , understand that HD are non mass commodities, with a MRSP less than 100 USD.
In my experience with heavy use design workstation, I have learned the "burning way" to definitely save a lot of money spending  few of it.
As a matter of experiment, I tested using UBUNTU Distro three HP-540D Workstations, whose hard disk have been almost continuosly spinning for more than six years.
I want to elaborate on your question of whether or not you can extend the life of your hard disk. I too have a 320GB Seagate drive that has been giving out on me, but I'm still using it a year later. I understand that the proper way to deal with such errors is to replace the drive, but not everyone has the resources to do so.
On my drive these tactics have worked out fine. I merely store absolutely replaceable data on it until it either crashes beyond any point of recovery or I can afford a replacement drive. In any case, SMART is not reliable. I had plenty of hard drives die without it ever having been triggered. On the other hand, a SMART message doesn't necessarily mean your hard drive will die tomorrow, but the chances are certainly higher than for drives that check out okay.
My advice is , as a strong and urgent suggestion, to replace at the EARLIEST convenience the failing device.
So i decided to transform the " Backup " in "Hot Standby" using a Pen Booting Distro, and keeping an eye on the S.M.A.R.T. Status.
