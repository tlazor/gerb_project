Our apis sit behind load balancers which base their decisions on among other things; the source ip of the requestor.
If the clients are on a private network behind a shared public IP (like ceejayoz's example with the VPC), then the API servers will only be able to see the shared public IP, unless the API Load Balancer is also on that same private network, which is highly unlikely unless you own the clients too.
I think ceejayoz nailed the answer, however I just want to clarify that the fact that your API servers are behind a load balancer is irrelevant. The API servers see the client's IP regardless of the existence of the load balancers. All the load balancers do is provide a single entry point for the API to the clients, and of course balance the requests across the multiple API servers.
The one exception is for instances in a private VPC subnet, which will show up with the IP of their NAT instance, as private VPC instances have no external facing IP.
Let's say we have a cloud formation of a thousand EC2 VMs; each making requests to our public apis; do these requestors appear as if coming from the one location or will they all have different source ip addresses? We are concerned that our load balancers may not behave in a real world manner.
