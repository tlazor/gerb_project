The error suggests that the agent cannot connect to the master because it cannot resolve the hostname of the master. 
View /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf and in section [main], confirm the value of server is correct.
Lastly, check the firewall on the puppetmaster.  Ensure all the required ports are allowed in the firewall configuration as specified in the documentation https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/install_system_requirements.html
Ensure the puppet agent is configured with the puppetmaster's hostname or fully qualified domain name.
This can be due to wrong networking setup (for example a wrong IP), missing DNS server entries or faulty DNS servers or due to a misconfiguration in the puppet.conf file on the agent.
Second, ensure the puppetmaster's hostname or fully qualified domain name resolves to an IP address.  Fix your DNS if it does not resolve.
See the puppetlabs configuration documentation https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_main.html
The error err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server indicates that the puppet agent was unable to contact the puppetmaster.
