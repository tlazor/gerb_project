I am using Let's Encrypt (certonly) to generate SSL certificates for several websites hosted on an Apache server. The file location of these certificates is determinate before they are created, so I am writing their paths into my virtual host configuration in advance. Once the site is running, I will use certbot to get the certificate files and then reload the Apache configuration.
The problem I'm having is that Apache won't run without all the certificate files, despite having a global fallback.  I tried to conditionally configure the Let's Encrypt certificate only when the file exists using IF, but Apache says SSLCertificateFile not allowed here.
I also have a global SSL certificate defined with valid files, so every SSL virtual host will be certain to have a certificate.
If the website has not yet the associated SSL certificate, then it should not be configured at all. You can put each website configuration in its own file, and have 2 directories: sites-enabled and sites-waiting with an Apache configuration saying to include everything from sites-enabled. When your website is configured (meaning it has its SSL certificate) you just need to move its configuration from one directory to another, and reload Apache.
Actually I have the .well-known alias in the same directory for all virtualhosts. This way the challenge is reachable via the default virtualhost when the new virtualhost is not enabled.
Another idea: if I understood correctly, you have global virtualhost as a catchall and then other virtualhosts, one per website.
How might I override the global SSLCertificateFile only when the new certificate files exist? I'm trying to do all of this without having to modify the configuration before and after the certificates have been generated.
