I'm on a windows 7 professional 64bit machine, but the same happens at home on my 32 bit windows 7 machine. Any ideas? Facebook being evil?
What? No, it's not Facebook being evil at all. It's more due to more virus out there that targeted Facebook. After all, your average Facebook user may not realize the SSL icon get crossed out, and happily enter their information on even obviously not-Facebook site. I believe since most GMail users are more technically inclined, the virus maker disregard targeting them. That, and the fact there are tiny population of GMail users (it's just more regarded in IT news), while Facebook are large enough to start their own country.
I'm one of those people that needs a bit of protection from their selves at work, so I wanted to add facebook.com to my hosts file. But something strange happens. The moment I add it Microsoft Security Essentials notifies me of a PossibleHostsFileHijack and presto: the facebook entry is removed automagically! All other entries, like gmail et cetera, are working just fine and dandy, but everytime I try to add facebook, it gets removed!
