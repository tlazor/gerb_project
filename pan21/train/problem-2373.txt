Its really simple with iTunes 9. iTunes 9 has a Playlist Folder in itself. All you have to do is drag a particular folder in a particular location onto the playlist pane. It will create an entire playlist based on files only in that particular folder. CHEERS!
In iTunes you may be able to create a SmartPlaylist that filters on Album or Artist.  There doesn't appear to be a way to use the folder to filter the list.
But, having done that, what I'd like to be able to do is point iTunes at each of those directories and have it turn them into their own playlists, so I end up with a Doctor Who Music and a Star Wars Music playlist based on the MP3s locations on the hard drive.
In OS X you can write a AppleScript to do what you want, e.g. my DiskHierarcyToItunes you can find at http://vladalexa.com/scripts/applescript/itunes/
Importing all those MP3s into iTunes is really simple - at the bare bones version you can just drag the MP3 folder into the iTunes window and it does the rest.
So, enqueue all the MP3s in question in WinAMP (generally, the easy way is to right-click on the folder itself and choose "Enqueue in Winamp".)  Save the resulting playlist as an M3U.
There is one catch - save the M3U in the same folder as the music files - otherwise WinAMP will put relative paths in the M3U rather than just the file names, and this will cause iTunes to think these are new files, even if you've already imported them.  If the M3U doesn't have paths, just the file names, iTunes will recognize which files it already has imported and will act accordingly.
