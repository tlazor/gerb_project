If you run Process Explorer from Microsoft you should be able to see processes that have been spawned from the Task Scheduler process i.e from svchost.exe.  If you right click the relevant process and if applicable you may have the option to switch to the Window.  However, I think this is dependant on your application.  It may also be worth considering using the Event Viewer or a log file to try and determine what is causing the problem.
First of all, I must chastise you for not writing this app as a native windows service.  It is designed to run at startup, in the background, with no user interaction, forever (barring admin intervention).  That's a textbook case of what a windows service does.  Abusing the functionality of the Task Scheduler to start an app that runs forever is just sloppy/lazy programming.  There are plenty of pre-written templates out there you can likely use for whatever language your app is using I'm sure.
All that said, why not just run this app manually on the server in the console session where you can already see it and just wait for it to fail like it normally does?
