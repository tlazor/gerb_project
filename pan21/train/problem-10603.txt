I've installed this "Windows XP mode" and soon realised my failure. So,I've downloaded the 2007 version and tried to install, but behold:
Well, I see no problem with uninstaling software I've never wanted in the first place, only if I knew a way to do it. After failing to locate uninstaler in the Start menu, I've seeked in the Add or remove programs (later on I've found this microsoft article sugesting the very same approach). Nope, it's not there. Neither "Microsoft Virtual PC", "Windows Virtual PC", "Windowx XP Mode" or the localised versions of the mentioned queries.
However, microsoft seems to have released some improvement - it appears as virtual PC, but in fact is some sort of Windows XP mode whatever.
I need a virtual machine to test my software on multiple platforms. For such purpose, I wanted to install the powerful Microsoft Virtual PC, which I've been using for years.
Last thing is, that the program (I downloaded x64 version) does not run under my x64 Windowx 7 Home Premium. So it's just blocking me.
I've also located the program executable, only to find out that it's right in System32 along with milion of other executables.
