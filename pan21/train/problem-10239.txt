in your apache configuration. because you only have ONE host for SSL, afaik, you shouldn't run into any problems with certificates, and so on.
I have already bought hosting from them. And they showed me that option while adding optional services to the account (after I placed my order), so I did not even have a clue about this.
This is the first time I am dealing with SSL and Dedicated Static IP /Unique IP. Now this webhost says that they will provide Unique IP (not shared with other customers) but do NOT guarantee that it will be static. Now I plan to make my website SSL enabled and install a SSL certificate. So in order to SSL enable my website, will I really need a Dedicated Static IP or will this Unique IP (without the guarantee that it will be static) be enough? What problems will I need to face if the IP is not  static?
you may get warnings when restarting apache, i don't know for sure, because 'name based' not 'ip based' virtual hosts are not recommended, because SSL has issues determining which host from an IP the request has come from, and which certificate to use. if you only have one IP/host, you shouldn't have problems.
you will be fine with what is called Name Based virtual hosts, providing SSL for your site, if you only have one site for SSL.
