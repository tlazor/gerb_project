For a lot of devices PCIe is perfectly fine going through various bridges as they simply don't have the intense memory dependence and bandwidth requirements. If the situation can tolerate a few nanoseconds more for it to traverse a north/south bridge link then there is no reason to connect the device directly to the North bridge or CPU, you connect it where there is spare connectivity.
A PCIe x1 soundcard for example would have fairly light bandwidth requirements, does not require nanosecond level response timings and quite frankly could probably tolerate being controlled over a couple of "wires" made from wet string.
I read in an article from 2007 called "What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory" that the PCI-e connections were connected to the Southbridge chip in contrast with AGP connections which were connected to the Northbridge chip.
A graphics card on the other hand does require good latency and regular large transfers of data, so you put it close to the memory and CPU. 
Just because you can put a PCIe bus at the end of a north/south bridge chain doesn't mean that that is your only PCIe bus in the system.
Is this true? If yes what was the reason for which the PCIE connections were connected to the Sourhbridge because the Southbridge is slower than Northbridge?
