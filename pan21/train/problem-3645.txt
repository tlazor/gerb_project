This is precisely what EC2 Elastic IPs are for. Nab an EIP, associate it with your server, and then you can point a proper DNS record to that EIP.
The key is, you shouldn't have to do access control using IP addresses or hostname. You use encryption (TLS) and authentication, so the SMTP provider should "trust" all mail coming from your local instance of postfix once it's setup to do auth. Most have ways of using sendmail as well.
First, most third party SMTP gateway providers support using their service as a authenticated, encrypted relay host:
Finally, you haven't described what you're using to send email from your EC2 instances. Depending on the language and library (I'm looking at you php mail) your mail submission agent (MSA) might do hairy things to mangle your message, possibly ignoring the values set above. php mail is infamous because on most systems it tries to invoke the sendmail binary, which you have to work around explicitly to prevent the message from being sent as the user running the webserver (e.g. www-data or apache)
