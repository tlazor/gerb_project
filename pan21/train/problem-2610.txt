You can buy a VPS and then set up a VPN to forward all requests to your machine. But with a VPS it would be probably easier to just put there your website.
Are you sure you want to host the website on your own computer? If so, is an address like http://trex.dyndns.org ok for you? In that case, you could just setup an account with dyndns.org. It is possible that you need to configure port-forwarding on your router.
You will need to get the ip routed to your isp in some manner. This will usually be by getting an ip from the allocations of ips that they already control. You can also get provider independent ranges for multihoming from an RIR ( ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, etc depending on your location ), however this will usually be a /24 of ips and I'm not sure that APNIC or RIPE have any left. This will also require a lot of setup from your isp and a business account.
I'm a You Broadband customer, to host a website I need a Static IP but with my chosen plan company doesn't provide me a static IP. They wanted me to buy a static IP. I had ready to do that but they are not properly responding me since last week. So I am thinking to get only a static IP from other ISP. Hence my question is:
I'd prefer to rent a webhosting solution from some hosting provider - then you do not need to care for all that security crap and IP addresses etc...
