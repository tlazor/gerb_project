The basic idea is to grab multiple (quality) resources of different kinds, and begin to work through all of them.  Do a little bit of each one every day, and make all of these activities as active as possible.  (For instance, create flashcards of concepts you want to review.  While reading physical books, don't be afraid to underline things you don't understand and revisit older underlines.)
Every content creator attempts to get at the material in a way that they feel emphasizes what is most important. This means that you end up learning multiple central conceits, and you develop a deep and capable understanding relatively quickly. If you find yourself getting stuck on one source, do your underlining, and move on to the next one.  The next day, you can revisit the first source with the new understandings that you have gained from the other resources, and thereby continue to progress.
If self-learning is a goal, you don't need to necessarily choose between resources at all.  I had to self-teach a tremendous amount of material this year, and to do so, I roughly borrowed the methodology from Barry Farber's incredible How To Learn Any Language.
