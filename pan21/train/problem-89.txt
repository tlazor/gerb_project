The password can be reset to default if needed, but you'll need to contact Promise technical support, you'll need a confuser file that can be installed from a lower level.
2) RJ11 to Serial Connector (normally you have to prepare it yourself http://www.amazon.com/InstallerParts-Female-Modular-Adapter-Ivory/dp/B008NCDN3I
I have been assigned an E610F Vtrak Storage unit, the previous admin left and did not leave any documentation, so IP Address for Management and Credentials are unknown.
From the screenshot you do not have a proper serial cable. Other vendors have cables that look like the Promise cable, but are wired differently.
Also, the default IP for a VTrak is 10.0.0.1, if this was not changed you may be able to login to WebPAM via the ethernet port. The default 'login/password' is 'administrator/password'.
Does anyone have an idea on what i can do to regain access? I think our support has ended long ago and I need to use this storage as instructed.
I get the Cli Promprt but I cannot see the boot messages, cannot input commands and cannot see the login prompt.
i am also configuring Vtrack e610f, first issue i couldn't find out any cable than i went to promise support and they sent me a diagram how to prepare this cable. 
I need a help from rich, how i can get Confuser.img files without promise technical support, since my warranty is finished.
