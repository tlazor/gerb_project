I had the same issue. I am behind a Enterprise firewall. As Wim Lewis mentioned in his post, I added the Certificates from the FW to the "Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Certificates" -> "View Certificates" ->  "Your Certificates" -> "Import"
Firefox, for historical reasons, has its own trust list separate from Windows', but IE uses the Windows list. It sounds like the intercepting certificate is in Windows' trust list and in one user's Firefox list but not in other users' lists.
I had this problem after downloading a subtitles file (.srt) from internet. It must have included a malware to change my setting in Firefox. I had to uninstall the firefox and delete all my settings from profile. Please see:
Firefox is protecting you from what it thinks is a man-in-the-middle attack, where some other program is intercepting and possibly altering your communications with Google. It's possible that your connection is actually being hacked, but another common possibility is that you (or your employer) has a firewall which inspects and possibly alters your web traffic for legitimate reasons. In that case, you would need to tell Firefox to allow that interception, by installing the firewall's certificate in Firefox's trust list.
