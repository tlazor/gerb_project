When you say you can ping your external IP, this is likely just pinging your WAN device, in this case your Asus router. It doesn't mean your router is able to access the desktop, or that you are necessarily pinging your desktop okay from outside of your network.
As said, the ping test externally will help you isolate whether your network is still connected to the internet, but it won't help find machines internally on your network. I would troubleshoot by monitoring the connection on the desktop machine locally, seeing if I lost network connectivity at any point, and testing remote desktop within the network until I know that is completely stable, before re-introducing the external element to it.
Are you able to get a connection out from the physical machine when you notice this problem? Are you able to ping the desktop ever? Have you definitely assigned the desktop a static IP (Wondering if it possibly changes to a different IP address if you have a particularly short DHCP lease)? Any software firewalls, including the Windows one, that may be misbehaving?
It sounds like, for some reason, your desktop is losing its network connectivity. It's hard to say exactly what may be causing this, but as every other device on your internal network is unable to ping it at the same time, it seems the most likely cause.
