You could also try rsh if you want something that comes with the operating system but isn't Powershell, though I don't remember if it will use your existing authentication context. Since it relies on WinRM just like Powershell remoting, I think it will, but I'm on my phone and can't test it. 
By default negotiate or kerberos authentication will be used so the command will run as the user who is running Powershell, without having to specify the credentials. 
I may be missing something here, but when you logon to a remote machine and execute a command, the command does indeed run under your logged on user credentials.
psexec, on the other hand, establishes a connection to a remote computer, and runs a command using credentials you specify in the psexec commandline - but your question sounds like you are already logged in via (RDP???) and just need to execute the command?
Enable Powershell remoting on the target server, then use Invoke-Command -ComputerName RemoteSeverName -ScriptBlock { some command } from Powershell on your computer. 
I want to run a command on a remote Windows server as the user that I am logged on as in Windows.  How do I do this?  
I suggest reading the documentation and the couple of pages linked to in the documentation. There are a few gotchas, and psexec can be quite a powerful tool.
