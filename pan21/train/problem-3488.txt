The '+' symbol doesn't show up in my man page for sort. So I don't know how you get +17. If you want to use the whole line, you do not need -t or -k, since the default is to start sorting from beginning of line, to end of line.
You'll probably want to use some combination of cut (to break out fields by byte), awk to splice them together, sort to sort the lines and then awk to recreate the lines in their original format.
The combination of options you're using for -t and -k seem like you're trying to do this outside of what sort usually does. Sort operates on fields with specific delimiters -- whitespace by default.
I need to get 1 log file with all the logs from multiple logs files, sorted by timestamp. Note that the log files are really huge, around 3-4G each (and there are dozens of them)
Actually... it fails miserably. The output file data_sort.txt is just the concatenation of all files, not sorted at all :(
Essentially, it concatenates all the .txt files, separates them with colons (for sorting), sorts the second field (the r sorts newest first, take it out if you want newest last), and then removes the colons, showing the original line.
Try using cat first to concatenate the files and then sort that. sort won't be confused about multiple files because it will see a single input stream coming from stdin.
