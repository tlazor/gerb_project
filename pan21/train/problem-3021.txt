After you've done all that, verify that you can TELNET to port 993 on the Exchange Server computer from a client and that you do get a successful open TCP connection (to make sure  communication between the client and server on TCP port 993 isn't being firewalled anywhere). Once you've got that, connect your test IMAP client to it.
The certificate created during installation of Certificate Services is a certificate authority (CA) certificate. (You may want to read up a bit on how a PKI works. It's dead simple math and logic, and it's a good thing to know about in general. Have a look at http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pki-icp/beginners/faq/faq-eng.asp for a nice beginner's guide.) That certificate is not suitable for use by the IMAP server.
(I'll leave the question of why you're using Outlook with an Exchange Server and the IMAP protocol instead of just using MAPI aside and just assume you're trying to test IMAP with Outlook and that you'll be using other non-Outlook IMAP clients later.)
Instead of choosing the CA's certificate when you're configuring SSL for your IMAP Virtual Server, create a new certificate and submit the request to your certificate server service via the "Send the request immediately to an online certification authority" radio-button in the IIS Certificate Wizard. This will cause a certificate and public/private keys to be created by IIS, submitted to the CA for signing, and a certificate to be issued and installed.
Be aware that by installing your own CA you're going to be creating certificates that won't be trusted by clients by default (since the clients have never heard of your CA). If you intend to turn this server loose on clients on the Internet at-large you're going to need to get a certificate from a trusted public certification authority.
