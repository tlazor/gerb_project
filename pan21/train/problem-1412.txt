Usually, TVs are optimized for viewing from distance and they have higher dot pitch, meaning that pixels are less densely packed on the screen itself. 
It is difficult to answer this question, because you provided us with almost no information. TV tells us almost nothing and purpose built monitor tells us almost nothing. If you tell us model of your TV someone may have an idea how good it works. You also need a reference monitor to compare it to. Some monitors are great and some are awful. 
I've done it without complaint, but like they say, it just depends. If it doesn't look sharp enough for you, a device like these: http://www.atlona.com/Atlona-Pal-HDMI-to-NTSC-HDMI-Converter-1080p.html can help.
I have a 32" Samsung 1080p that works great as a monitor when I'm sitting in my comfy chair with some 2-3m between me and the TV. 
The only way to know for sure it to compare your TV with a monitor. Some TVs may look great, while others could produce "CAN'T UNSEE" effect.
On the other hand, monitors are usually smaller and have lower dot pitch and are optimized for viewing at shorter range.
