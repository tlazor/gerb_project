Every operating system needs a way to interact with connected volumes. Each volume has its unique identifier and a possibly name.
Names aren't unique, so it's not a good idea to use them to distinguish drives. On the other hand, UUIDs aren't flexible enough - for example you may want to replace a volume with another one, but keeping it accessible the same way as before. It wouldn't work with UUIDs.
Unix-like systems are based on a mounting scheme (which is also partially implemented in Windows NTFS filesystem). One volume becomes a root (/) and other volumes can be virtually mounted in subdirectories of that volume (usually subdirectories of /mnt or /media are used). This scheme is much more powerful than drive letters, as you are not limited by alphabet letters and can give your volumes any virtual names.
So OSes must have some way of mapping volumes to other kind of identifiers. Windows uses drive letters for this: you can assign any not-yet-used drive letter to any drive, possibly more that one letter to a single drive. That letter isn't reserved permanently, it will be assignable again as soon as you disconnect that volume.
