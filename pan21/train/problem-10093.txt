Just be very careful, and have a backup plan in place.  If anything goes wrong, you're going to be offline and need to visit yourself, or find someone else local to be your hands.
I need to change the configuration of a remote (6 hours' drive) client's Cisco 871 (IOS 12.4.15T) from my location because of some new internet service at his location.  To be more precise, I need to change the default route, ip address of the outside interface (Fa4) and disable the PPPoE setup there.  Unfortunately, doing any of this will (obviously) break the connection to the router.  I do not have an out-of-band management modem set up (I know, I know).  
If you're on a recent IOS, you can use IOS.sh. Once you do term shell, you can separate commands by semicolons on one line, and they'll be run sequentially, just like in bash or similar.
Do you have telnet access to the router? You can telnet to the router, copy the running config to notepad, make the needed changes, and paste the contents of notepad back into the router from config mode and that should do it.
Is there any way to enter the commands I need to have run and have them execute one after the other, from a file on flash:?  I have never tried anything like that before.  Essentially a DOS-style batch file is exactly what I need.  Nothing like it seems to be out there except using kron to execute CLI commands, but that is specified here as only taking EXEC commands, not configuration ones.  Is there hope, or do I travel?
You may lose your telnet connection temporarily but the router will continue pasting the uploaded config and assuming that the new config works you'll be able to telnet back in and save it to the startup config.
If you have a tftp server that is accessible to the router, you can edit your configuration there, and then load the configuration from the tftp server.
