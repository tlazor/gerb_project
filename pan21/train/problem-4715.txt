foobar2000 has a supported DNLA plugin. Its winamp-styled, configurable and works pretty well in general 
MediaMonkey plays over DLNA. Also syncs with lots of devices. http://www.mediamonkey.com/wiki/index.php/WebHelp:Setting_UPnP/DLNA_Media_Servers/4.0
I have been searching and testing extensively. The only sotware that fully enables a window pc as a DLNA renderer is XBMC, eith its huge, heavy, memory-eating interface.
It may look as provocative, but if you just need to remotely operate audio, maybe the best solution is NOT to use a PC as a pure renderer: there are so many cheap Android devices available now (simple tablets, or even an old phone with a broken screen will do!), and there's plenty of DLNA apps available. Instead of setting up a renderer on the Windows OC, with less than 80$ you can set up an Android device to be dedicated to do that.
- MediaMonkey can be tweaked to load as a rendere player, with just an icon in the system tray shown; but the memory usage is not as light, and it seems to hang when control point starts reproduction of remote streming contnts (icecast, udps etc)
Believe it or not Windows Media Player sees my mediatomb server - unfortunately it won't play the files on it due to codec issues, but it may work for you.
