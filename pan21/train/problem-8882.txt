I would really like to know why this happens and what i can do to fix it. BTW, I would also really like to be able to change the players speed and still have it work.
This is because your raycast is from the center of the player to a length equal to speed.  You're discounting the size of the player in this calculation.
Where player_radius is the size of your player.  It would be best to make this either a reference to the game object's transform's scale, the game object's collider's size, or a constant property (collider size is best, if you're using one).
I am currently making a 2d top down game in unity and have stumbled upon a problem with my raycast collision. I want my green player to stop moving when colliding with a wall, therefore i made my player object cast a ray in the direction it is moving. Its velocity is nullified when the distance to the collision point is equal to zero, or below. What seems to be the case is that the player object stops moving way to late and ends up overlapping the wall object. I tried to make an offset such that the player stopped a bit earlier, but it seems that the offset needs to differ depending on the side of the wall block. It even feels like the point at where the player stops is arbitrary and differs from time to time.
