I had a Samsung evo 840 120GB system drive encrypted with truecrypt for about a year. Everything worked fine and when I replaced the drive the SMART data didn't indicate any more wear than is to be expected in 1 year. The only downside was that the speed was half of what it would have been without encryption.
Note that all of this may vary from drive to drive because the biggest variable is the controller on the SSD.
The encryption naturally adds overhead, which will lower the speed of read and writes just like on a platter drive.  It shouldn't negatively impact the lifespan of the drive unless it's an encryption scheme which requires a lot of additional writes, or the particular sorts of data patterns that are getting written are a lot more susceptible to write amplification on your particular drive (which is awfully unlikely and basically impossible to know ahead of time).  
Yes, it will affect. However you can check the possible problems before actual ssd usage. Try SsdReady free tool to estimate amount of writes to the disk and as result you'll get an approximate lifespan of SSDs.
SSD require specific maintenance by the OS, such as the TRIM function. Can a full hard drive encryption or a partition encryption using programs such as TrueCrypt negatively effect an SSD drive?
Most brand-new drives are actually using controller-based garbage collection, etc; this all is happening way below the OS level so it should be irrelevant what the data is.  TRIM specifically I'm not 100% sure on, but the actual functionality is again happening on the controller level so it should be fine as well.
