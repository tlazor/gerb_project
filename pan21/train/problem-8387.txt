After re-assembling the laptop, everything works great. It's possible that something was loose and re-assembling it fixed that problem. It might have been an overheating issue that was fixed by re-seating the heat pipes. The factory thermal paste was spread everywhere, so cleaning that up might have helped as well.
I finally got this laptop working again. I've been using it for about two months now without a single screen flickering issue, so I'm confident that the problems I was seeing are resolved.
Unfortunately, I can't say exactly what the problem was or what fixed it, other than that it was a hardware problem. 
I fixed it by taking the laptop apart completely. I removed the heat sinks/heat pipes from the CPU and GPU. I cleaned off all of the old thermal paste from everything. It turns out the video card isn't integrated directly into the motherboard but is a separate small card plugged into a port, sitting in a cutout section of the main board. So I took that out, cleaned the connection and re-seated it. Then I applied new thermal paste and put everything back together.
