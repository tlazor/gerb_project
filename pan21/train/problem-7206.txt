Is it possible to have more than one init system, and choose which one to use through, e.g., a configuration file?
OpenRC is not well ported to Debian, they are not thinking on OpenRC as a full replacement of both SystemD and SysVinit, the current version available for Debian Stretch it's 0.23 and this version doesn't have openrc-init (replacement for init), even if you migrate to sid or testing you have version 0.34 and this version includes openrc-init and indeed OpenRC can work as a full init but this package doesn't include the scripts for agetty, or the symlinks for shutdown, reboot, etc. and this means some work and for sure some problems.
I want to install Debian Linux (on a 2009 Macbook Pro), opting for the OpenRC init system. By default, Debian uses Systemd. During the installation, I did not see any option to choose the init system; how can I choose OpenRC (or Sysvinit)?  
Once Systemd is installed, can I replace it with OpenRC, or is it not feasible due to how invasive Systemd is?  
My point on one who wants to run a distro with full OpenRC it's to install Gentoo or some of their derivatives, and also some Arch based distros like Parabola (OpenRC version), Hyperbola or Artix.
