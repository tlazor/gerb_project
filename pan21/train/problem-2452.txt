After almost 30yrs of coding I have (understandably) become a huge fan of one-liner commands whenever possible - especially when it can replace an entire page of instructions/actions with fancy screenshots. :)

To uninstall the Indexing service, open the Windows Features dialog (Start -> OptionalFeatures.exe) and un-check the Indexing Service entry.
