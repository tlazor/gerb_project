--> Switch uses mac addresses to achieve its mission which is connecting hosts and devices in the same network.
How router knows mac adress of 02? The answer is that ARP table in router. Router looks its ARP table to find mac adress of 172.16.1.3. After these operations, there is a new packet that generated from router. There is no mac adress of 01 in this new packet so 02 will never know mac adress of 01. Ultimately, there will be no entry in 02's ARP table about 01.
Two network means two different ip subnets. In your question, 01 and 02 must have different network IDs if you don't use IP tunneling.
First thing about your network design is that there are two different subnets in other words there are two different networks. Router connects these networks. In order to answer your question, we should understand how actually router and switch works and what they do in network. In short;
Let's say, Network ID of 01 is 192.168.1.0/24 and its ip adress from this block is 192.168.1.4. Network ID of 02 is 172.16.0.0/16 and its ip adress from this block is 172.16.1.3. In addition to them, router's ip adress for first interface that belongs 192.168.1.0/24 is 192.168.1.1 and for other interface that belongs 172.16.0.0/16 is 172.16.1.1.
When you ping from 01 to 02 like ping 172.16.1.3, router will forward your ICMP packet to other side by changing frame fields. This is really important! Router will change source mac adress field from mac adress of 01 to its mac adress that belongs its interface that belongs 172.16.0.0/16 networks. Then router will instert mac adress of 02 to the destination mac adress field.
