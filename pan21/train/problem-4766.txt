If you want to do this on a remote Linux then inoticoming, inocron, or other tools built on inotify can do the same "watch a folder" stuff that Automator on the mac will do.
Handbrake includes a command line version, which is nice.  That makes it amenable to the wonders of Automator, and there is a bunch of good documentation on the Internet about combining the two; one is at http://vimeo.com/13288592
I know I can use Handbrake to do this all by hand, but I'd like to automate the process. I'm on a Mac, so as a first step, I've tried downloading ffmpeg for the Mac but it's a nightmare to get it going. (This requires XPorts, XPorts requires the Xcode unix tools, those aren't available to install in the Mac App Store as best I can tell, etc...)
You can also use other tools, as noted here, which covers the Automator side very well: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easy-automatically-add-downloaded-movies-itunes-mac/
Ideally this would all be done on a remote server instead of on my Mac... my dream setup is a box in the cloud (like an Amazon EC2 instance?) that monitors a folder; when AVI files appear in that folder, it converts them to mp4 that's good for iTunes, then on my Mac I can just automate the last step: FTPing them down to the iTunes "automatic import" folder (so they eventually end up in my iTunes library and sync to the iPhone... phew, that's a lot of steps!!!). Is that out there?
Making any of those work with ffmpeg rather than Handbrake, or QuickTime, is pretty simple: work out what you need ffmpeg to do (or grab one of the set of wrappers for it), and then have Automator do the driving for you.
