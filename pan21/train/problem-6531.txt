So say, instead of having a single RAID 0 array with four drives, you could span two RAID 0 arrays into a single RAID 0 array.  Would this would give a performance increase?  I'd guess no, that it wouldn't make any difference, but I wanted to check before completely ruling it out as a possibility.  Or is IBM saying that RAID 00 offers a performance increase only because it allows you to put more than 16 drives in a single logical array?
I'm purchasing a LSI 9260-8i RAID controller for four SSD drives, which supports RAID level 00.  We are all about getting the best IO performance in this particular application, so hence the RAID 0.
There is one overriding technical reason to use RAID 00 (or 50, 60, spanned RAID-sets) and that is due to the fact that current RAID sets are limited to 32 physical drives per set. Spanning multiple sets allow you to break that physical boundary while adding performance and, in certain cases, redundancy.
We run special, short-term projects and reconfigure massive arrays of physical disks all the time and are forced to span sets as a result.
The only way that would improve performance is if by doing so you can gain access to new I/O channels. An example of this would be to use software RAID-0 to stripe across storage attached to two discrete RAID cards on the system, each of which is configured with RAID-0 storage. You would be adding to the number of discrete I/O channels available to service that storage, and would increase its theoretical bandwidth. 
In your case you have a 1:1 mapping of ports to drives on a single card. The performance difference between RAID00 and RAID0 would be negligible. 
There would be no performance increase over a RAID0's normal performance with that quantity and type of drives.
