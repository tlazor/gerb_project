Here is relevant parts of my httpd.conf file. Without this VirtualHost I don't get the error message.
It's because your VirtualHost directive doesn't match your ServerName directive and/or the CN of the certificate. All three need to be identical, unless you have a wildcard certificate where the non-wild portions must be identical.
I have recently upgraded from Centos 5.7 to 6.3, and by that to a newer httpd version. I have always made my ssl virtualhost configurations like below. Where all domains that share the same certificate (mostly/always wildcard certs) share the same ip. But never got this error message before (or have I, maybe I haven't looked to enough in my logs?) From what I have learned this should work without SNI (Server Name Indication)
Since you're sharing the IP, browsers without SNI support will just get the first website and never the second.
And you're getting it because 1) you've updated your Apache version and 2) you have 2 SSL VirtualHosts using the same exact IP address (as opposed to using 2 IPs).
