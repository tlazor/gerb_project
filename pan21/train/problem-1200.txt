I have a simple Flask http server running on my Pi that reports GPIO and controls some GPIO.  While on my home wifi, I have no problem interacting with the RPi via the flask server using some Restful services on the RPi to turn on relays and get reading from GPIO pins.
it can be port forwarding with the public IP of your ISP, just be aware that most ISP use dynamic IP ( in that case you will have to update that IP in your modem again),but is you want to enter from local network, you can do port forwarding of your local IP, that will be only visible in your network
The simplest route would be to use port forwarding. port forwarding is forwarding an internal lan(local area network, the network created by your router) ip address's port(for example, the port your raspberry pi's website is on) to your external ip address(the address you are given on the entire internet, not just locally.). this would make it so that you could access your website by typing your ip address into the address bar. you can do this by accessing your routers admin panel and setting up port forwarding, so it will be different for different routers. here is a nice guide. You will want to forward your pi's ip address, with the port your website is on. then you can access your website by typing your ip address(you can find it by searching for ip on google) into the address bar of a web browser. 
I have my RPi on my home network.  It is an Xfinity cable router running 250mbps.  I can reach the internet through the RPi, I just need to reach the RPi to from the other direction now.
I want to extend this functionality outside of my local Wifi now.  I want to be able to hit the web server on my RPi from the internet even if I am half way across the country.  Can someone point me in the right direction to do this?
