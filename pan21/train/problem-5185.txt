In a single domain environment without Exchange you don't need a GC, even with multiple sites. GC has got nothing to do with locating domain controllers in this scenario.
As many have said, I can't understand why you want to do this. If you have multiple domains in your forest, you really need a GC per domain for them to communicate effectively and if you only have 1 domain in your forest, then your GC really doesn't add much overhead.
The GC is the system against which you actually authenticate.  If you have no GCs you can't authenticate.  Hit TechNet and you will see this pervasively throughout the documentation.
You need at least on GC, your first domain controller is setup by default as a Global Catalog server.
This is a bizarre request.  According to the TechNet article on GCs, in a single-Domain environment the only absolute requirement for a GC seems (and I do say "seems") to be for GAL lookups in Exchange, but all the same I'm failing to understand why creating a GC could be something you would want to avoid.
