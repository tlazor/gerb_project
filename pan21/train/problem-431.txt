PowerShell has ways of querying this information (get-eventlog). On Server 2008 you have access to wevtutil which is a tool that can query log-data using xpath formatted strings (hard to master, but useful to know) and dump into XML files for analysis. There are a few questions on ServerFault that relate to this sort of analysys. 
Practically, this can be accomplished through the Windows GUI or the icacls tool. Since icacls is vastly easier to document on a site like this, that's what I'll provide.
Windows does indeed have the capabilities to log accesses to files. It is extremely spammy, and requires automated log-analysis to get anything useful out of them. There are a variety of tools to do so. Splunk (I'm sure you've seen the ads on this site about them) is perhaps the top of the line. At the bottom of the list are scripts that scrape the Windows Security Event Log for interesting events. 
Having just completed a long stint as an academic system administrator, I know full well how versatile Windows permissioning can be if done right. But first, to answer the question as asked.
Since this is on a Windows server, you can use some custom NTFS rights to better pare down what students can and can't do in a directory. You have to pay attention to rights inheritance to make this work, but dropboxes can indeed be created safely. We were using them quite happily in certain areas. 
This will allow students to copy in files, not be able to modify them once copied in, and only view their own files. If a student attempts to copy over an existing file, they will get an access-denied error. If a student attempts to open a file they know is there but do not have rights to it, they will get an access-denied error.
