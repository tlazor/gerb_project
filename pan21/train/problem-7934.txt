Ultimately, I resolved this issue by demoting the new DC, leaving it as a simple member for several days, then re-promoting it (in order to perform additional tests). Re-promoting it caused the new controller to replicate the previously missing files properly, rendering the tests somewhat redundant.
However, I should note that I did try demoting and re-promoting the new DC earlier, to no avail. It may be that the long period in which it wasn't doing DFS replication caused some form of timeout; given the lack of clear data that's my best guess as to how this got sorted.
However, dcdiag does not show any obvious hints as to what is wrong (see output below), and DFSR seems to believe that it is replicating correctly, as per the output of dfsradmin backlog. dfsrdiag replicationstate shows no active connections, but I'm not sure whether or not this is normal; dfsradmin membership list shows both DCs.
Does anyone have any ideas? I'm pretty much at my wit's end; I'd even try manually copying the policies over were it not for the fact that there are many permissions issues involved in doing so.
We recently added a second DC to our network at a different site. The DCs do not appear to have any difficulty communicating via the network, and AD objects (users, computers etc) are synchronising correctly. However, group policies are not. Examining the C:\Windows\SYSVOL\domain folder on the new DC shows that it is empty, whereas on the old DC it contains the Policies and scripts folders with associated contents.
