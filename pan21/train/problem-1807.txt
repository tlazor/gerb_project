No, you can't; you have a problem reading the data at those dodgy blocks on /dev/sdd.  You just don't know that in ordinary operation, either because you don't happen to read those blocks, or your application is tolerant of read errors.
Edit: Yes, you should enlarge the partition as you describe. I'm not an ubuntu fan, so I can't comment on that version.  If you get this resync done, I'd replace the other drive immediately. If you have a decent backup, I'd stop wasting time with the resync, replace it now, recreate the array, and restore from backups.
I find messages like those that /dev/sdd is logging to be extremely worrying.  If it were my device, I'd back the data up as fast as possible, preferably twice, replace the other drive as well drive, and restore from such a backup as I'd been able to get.
In addition, as you point out, you're trying to mirror a 976762552 block partition with a 976761560 block one, and that won't work; the new partition needs to be at least as big as the old one.  I'm slightly surprised that mdadm allowed reconstruction to proceed, but you don't say what distro you're running, so it's hard to know how old the version is; perhaps it's old enough not to check that sort of thing.
