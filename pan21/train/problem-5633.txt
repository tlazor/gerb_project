Pointing the installation to use the flash drive should work most of the time. I have to admit I have never done this myself. The downside is that you will need to update each system you use the key on (if you want to install Ubuntu), as the USB key will hold only the regular LiveCD, without any released update. 
if you have issues, I recommend that you COMPLETELY erase all partitions from the USB stick, creating a brand new partition tabel . This fixed several of my problems I had on USB key that would otherwise not boot properly.
Still, there's no real guarantee that it will work on any computer. You can always find one that's incompatible for some reason.
I don't think that setup does customize installation for a specific computer hardware on Ubuntu, except for display drivers. I think it would be safe to have Ubuntu installed on flash drive (well, except for wear and tear which comes with having OS installed).
You certainly start with the USB key created by this menu option, as explained previously. But once you are satisfied, I strongly recommend that you install it on a real hard disk. Boot from the USB key, where you should find an Install icon. Start it, specifying the proper device for the USB key. At the very last screen, click htis "Advanced..." button to ensure that the GRUB loader is indeed installed on the USB device, not the main hard disk (/dev/sda). Restart your system, from this USB key.
Rather, it copies and customizes the CD image to use the flash drive (to have the possibility of saving your session back onto the flash drive). That's why to create a bootable flash drive, you need either the physical CD, or the ISO file.
