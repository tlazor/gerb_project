Here is what i have my terminal icon mapped to, which is close to center on my 1900x1200 resolution:
So, since GNOME v3.30 there is a visible option in GNOME Tweaks, which makes it easy to enable it for all windows:
most (probably all) window managers have configuration options that you can tweak to set where new windows are opened.
I couldn't figure out the centering problem (in X) either, so I just did some rough math on my screen dimensions to determine a close centerpoint.  I needed this for my terminal window, similar to Ken above.
(*) by default, that is.  if they're opened with a specific geometry then that overrides the default.
i can't remember exactly what metacity is capable of...haven't used it for ages.  i think it can centre windows by default.
The question title is only about the Terminal, however, it seems the body is more general about "programs start at the top left of [â€¦ the] screen".
To add to this, I have an alias in my .bashrc which I use when I need to open 4 terminals fast.  The below will open 4 terminals, each pinned to the 4 corners, and 100 columns by 23 rows.  Note that I go out of order in the calls so that the last line executed (the last terminal opened) is the upper left one, allowing me to start there.
openbox has a check-box "Center new windows when they are placed".  that causes all new windows(*) to open in the centre of the screen.
sawfish is very flexible and programmable - you can set rules so that windows matching certain criteria are always centered, always opened in desktop 2, have a different frame style, and so.
