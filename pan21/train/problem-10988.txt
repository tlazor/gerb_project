Well The Problem you are having with NC ( assuming you are talking about NETCAT) the Apple Version does not have the -e option in its bin.  
You should now be able to connect using any standard ssh client. Macs and linux/unix machines have it built in. PuTTY is a good choice on Windows.
The best solution is, to Compile a GNU version of NC using the apple SDK, then replace the apple version with your own GNU NC version. as far as i know apple has no plans to add the -e option to appleNC.
If you set up an SSH keys (for instance with "ssh-keygen -t rsa") with no passphrase and then put the public key (as found in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) in the ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts file in the remote user's host, then you won't need to exchange any passwords and everything can be done from the command line using ssh.
Second, you have failed to adequately describe what you're trying to do. Are you trying to remotely login to a Mac OS X computer from another computer? Are you trying to remote from the OS X computer to another? Are you trying to create some sort of remote server that's accessible externally?
First off, nc (which I had no prior knowledge of) appears to be a kind of telnet program. Insecure at best and rather rudimentary. I would not advise trying to use it.
