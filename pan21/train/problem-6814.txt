Then I had a sinking (syncing) feeling that maybe dropbox wasn't smart enough to realize it already had these 10,000 or so files on this machine already in the cloud and would create 10,000 conflicted copies---not something I wanted.  So I wrote db help, but really got no comforting answer.  The person didn't seem to grasp my question and gave me answers that left me wondering.  
For some reason (I do not know why), dropbox.exe disappeared from my tray and I couldn't find it my windows program menu either.  It showed that it was installed when I went to control panel>remove programs.  So I unistalled db then reinstalled it.  When I restarted db, however, it looked like it wasn't aware of the selective sync configuration on that machine.  It may be that I didn't give db time to figure it out, but I quickly paused syncing, set selective sync to the way it was prior to reinstall of db.  
So I'm still paused on that machine.  Hoping that I can gain some clarity.  I'd rather disconnect the machine from the dropbox ecosystem, delete all the files and start over again--as if it were a new machine--rather than deal with 10,000 superfluous conflicted copies.
