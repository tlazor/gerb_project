The password requirement can be eliminated through the use of ssh public key authentication instead of turning off passwords on your ec2 boxes.  
Turning off password checking on your EC2 boxes could mean that anyone can login and use them.  That can be a problem.  For instance, someone could run up a bill on your account.  
I'm not using NX but you've made me curious about it if you think it is fast enough to support this sort of thing.
Also, I don't know why you would want to run 100 instances all running firefox.  If you want to automate the collection of web pages, consider looking at wget.
you keep the private key in your .ssh/id_rsa and you copy the public key to the remote computer and paste it into .ssh/authorized_keys
There is a way to do this sort of thing without NX; namely, with an X client  (like a local ubuntu installation) and ssh with Xwindows forwarding.  Perhaps this is similar enough that you can modify it for your needs.
If you decide you want a password after all, you can add a passphrase to your key if you like, but you only have to do that on the local computer, not the remotes. Or, you can delete the key out of .ssh/authorized_keys and ssh will use password checking instead of key checking when you log in.
