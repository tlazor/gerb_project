I don't think kids need to be taught how to use computers. However, students should definitely be taught how to type at a young age, but other computer skills will be picked up as time goes on.
This Wikipedia article describes things that you can introduce to children in certain ages. Maybe you could teach the students to use the computer by introducing them to the simple programming languages described there (scroll down to "Languages by age and experience").
When I was in school (I'm a second year cse major in college now), we weren't taught anything related to computers except how to type. From my experience, people (of all ages) are not going to learn how to do anything with a computer, except through using one.
So I think the best solution is to give assignments which require students to use computers (essays, presentations, etc) and provide the facilities for those who don't have access to computers or the necessary software. The teachers can then give demonstrations and assist students who need help. But asking elementary school students to do such assignments seems a little extreme, although middle school might be a good place to start.
I would recommend basic word processing and spreadsheets and the like starting in third or fourth grade. Before that, typing skills and some learning games, especially ones with problem solving and hand-eye coordination, are the main things needed. At around sixth grade I'd start with networks and interconnections. Throw email in there just about anywhere once they have decent writing skills (fourth or fifth?). If you can get them pen pals (or email pals) across the country or world, that could be a real eye opener for young kids, and make them more open to the world.
