Solving the HTTPS to www.example.com is harder. The problem is that usually you can not do name based virtual hosting with HTTPS. The reason is that the SSL connection is set up before Apache knows which host you are trying to connect to, so doesn't know which SSL certificate to send, so has to send the first one it knows about. The result is that if you try to do name based SSL you'll get sent the wrong certificate on every virtual host except one, and the browser will display an error to the user. You can get around this using a wildcard certificate for *.example.com, or using a certificate with an Subject Alternative Name on it. Unfortunately these certificates cost more money and you may find support patchy on more obscure clients. 
Solving the HTTP to secure.example.com is easy. You just create an additional virtual host to direct to HTTPS:
If you solved the SSL problem, this will just work without errors. If you did not, then the client should get an error message about the hostname not matching the certificate, but should then redirect to http.
