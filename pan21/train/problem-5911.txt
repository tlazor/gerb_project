One way to achieve this would be to set up administrator@customerdomain.com as a shared mailbox and configure auto-forwarding on the mailbox settings. This way the emails are being sent by an @customerdomain.com address and SPF won't fail.
I considered how you might set up some kind of exclusion in your mail system, but you would have to know the details of all senders to be able to configure any kind of bypass; even then you would be opening yourself up to security risks, which happens any time you decide to 'trust' a sender.
I don't think that Exchange is actually forwarding the emails. If that were the case then the email would be listed as coming from an @customerdomain address. The emails are just redistributed to another mail system. This being the case, and by design, SPF is broken because Office365 is not allowed to send mail on behalf of vendor.com. 
That said, I just did my own bit of research and it seems Microsoft are in the process of rolling out Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which fixes this very problem:
