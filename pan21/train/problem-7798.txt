When you plug in a device, Windows will search Microsoft Update for the driver if it isn't found on your PC.  Most of the drivers from Microsoft were either written by them directly, or were submitted by the vendor for WHQL certification.
Drivers are closed-source, proprietary software from the companies that make the various chipsets found in the devices you use, which means they are still covered by copyright law.  Whether Microsoft wrote a generic driver themselves, or is hosting a 3rd-party vendor's driver, they're still hosting it on their servers for Windows to find, and they must be legally authorized to do so.
If the driver is not signed and Microsoft does not approve the driver then the automatic install will fail. Another reason why the automatic install may fail is because the device is not recognized or does not work with the driver selected for this device. 
Some companies do not allow this, for whatever reason.  Others just never ask and Microsoft doesn't care.  Either way, they can't possibly have a driver for every device out there, so that's why it's hit-or-miss on your part.
