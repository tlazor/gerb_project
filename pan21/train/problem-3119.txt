Ideally I'd like the drives to be readable somehow in OS X in case I ever need to access them from one of my Macs. Also, I don't have an extra 4 TB of space floating around anywhere, so I'll have to convert the drives to something usable in Linux one at a time. Since Linux has limited supported for HFS+, I figured I'd mount the existing HFS+ partition on one of the drives read-only, then set up the other one with the filesystem I want to use and copy over the data, then convert the other and copy the data again.
It hasn't worked out so well, especially when I try to download a file via BitTorrent on to a remote file system. Turns out the Airport Extreme isn't really up to the job. It's especially bad when torrenting and streaming 1080p video at the same time.
I'm currently working on setting up a Debian media and torrent server for my home. Most of my home network is comprised of Macs, and up until now my "server" was two 4 TB hard drives formatted HFS+ and plugged into an Airport Extreme, which shared them over the network. One drive was set up as a mirror of the other, updated daily.
So I'd like to replace it with a Debian server, and continue using both external drives in a mirrored configuration. The question is, what filesystem should I use for these drives, and how should I convert them?
Ext4 is another option, since it's certainly tried-and-true in Linux and I think that's readable in OS X, but once again I'm not sure.
I was thinking ZFS, since it seems to have great performance and reliability, and can be used in both Linux and OS X. Even better if I can use zpools to achieve mirroring, both for the automatic redundancy and possible performance boost. However I haven't really used ZFS before, in Debian or otherwise, so I don't know if there's any snafus I might not be aware of.
