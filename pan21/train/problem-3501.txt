Plenty of ways actually. For e. g., you can NAT your private IPs to some IP within the subnet. You can subnet it further and connect some hosts to your ASA directly on those IPs.
The provider requires us to connect via PPPoE, and I managed to configure the ASA as a PPPoE client and establish a connection. The ASA is assigned an IP address by PPPoE, and I can ping out from the ASA to the internet, but I should have access to an entire /28 subnet. I can't figure out how to get that subnet configured on the ASA, so that I can route or NAT the available public addresses to various internal hosts.
We've just received a fiber uplink, and I'm trying to configure our Cisco ASA 5505 to properly use it.
It doesn't. Your ISP knows (hopefully) that hosts within given sub-net are reachable via the ASA. In case the ASA wouldn't have connected peer (or other proper route to), the ping-pong would begin: ISP sends packet to ASA, and the ASA sends it back by its default route. That's why I'd recommend at least adding static route saying that your assigned subnet is reachable via Null device.
To clarify my config; The ASA is currently configured to default-route to our ADSL uplink on port Ethernet0/0 (interface vlan2, nicknamed Outside). The fiber is connected to port Ethernet0/2 (interface vlan50, nicknamed Fiber) so I can configure and test it before making it the default route. Once I'm clear on how to set it all up, I'll fully replace the Outside interface with Fiber.
The address I get via PPPoE is 188.xx.xx.177/32, which according to our provider is our Default Gateway address. They claim the subnet is correctly routed to us on their side.
