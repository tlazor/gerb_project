I often end up using strace to track down odd issues. As a result, trying to syntax highlight some of the lines can get ridiculous with a large string string. This being the case, I use set synmaxcol=2048 to limit the syntax highlighting to 2048 columns.
If you are usually working at a user, than this make it possible to "pipe" a file to sudo so it can be saved.
Shameless plug. This is not really a .vimrc change but rather a VIM plugin. I use RCSVers on every installed version of VIM. Basically it uses the RCS command to save off a version of any file you edit. You don't know how many times I've screwed up a config file only to have RCSVers save me by showing me the changes I've made.
I'm also quite a fan of the taglist plugin which uses exuberant tags. So far I've been able to push around the compiled ctags binary around and haven't come across any library issues. This quickly allows me to navigate among any of the code I work with. Those generally being Perl, Python, or C.
Since I know that a lot of VIM new comers will read this, the best suggestion I have is: "Do not get lazy and put map entries in your .vimrc" Learning non-standard ways of doing things in VIM will make you feel like a total gimp when you are without your vimrc. The learning curve for vi is steep, but you are not doing yourself any favors by choosing not to learn.
