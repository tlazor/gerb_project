It is true that Li-ion batteries will survive longer at around 60% than at full charge, I personally would not want it to do that by itself after just a few days, the battery does have a limited number of discharge cycles after all.
A battery should not discharge that fast just due to the chemical self discharge. If it is in standby then it is normal. The discharge from RTC and other thing that means that the computer is not completely off will not draw that much.
I have the same laptop, Its actually a feature on the laptop that will extend the life of the battery. Because a full charge will decrease it. In order to change it to a full charge, you have to Energy Management program and select the Maximum Battery life instead of the Optimized battery health option.
I checked with my local Lenovo rep and it appears that this is a feature of some new Lenovo laptops where machines which are left alone for extended periods (i.e. days in my case) would discharged to around 60% automatically to extend battery life. It is possible to turn this off; I will do this to see if it is indeed doing whatever Lenovo is telling me.
