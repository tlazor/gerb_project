That brings up a good point about availability, as well.  If you're a guy short in sales, you make fewer sales.  A guy short in accounting, um, the paperwork piles up?  A guy short in IT means that someone, or some department, or some business function throughout the company will not work.  This doesn't make the case for IT to sit around playing Doom all day, but it does explain why you don't have a skeleton crew, if you expect the rest of the business to avoid constant interruption.
These kinds of people view IT as overhead, an expense much like rent.  However, our job is far more like shooting at a target strapped to a buffalo, while we stand on a train with a monkey jumping on our heads.  It's not the same thing every day.  It's ever-changing, and you couldn't be sitting around bored collecting a paycheck for nothing if you tried.
Another use for all those monitoring & automation systems.  Forward him copies or screenshots of the backup report, the temperature monitoring, the uptime report, etc, etc - along with your notes on what needs to be done, or what steps you took as a result of your findings.  That might provide an easier way to get into the discussion about how these items can take up 5% or 200% of a working day, depending on severity.
