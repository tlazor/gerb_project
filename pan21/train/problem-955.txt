When a guest crosses the size of a node, you will have NUMA effects upon accessing remote CPUs or RAM. For those hex-core sockets, definitely by vCPU 8. These would also apply to operating systems on the physical server without a hypervisor. Probably manageable, given ESXi and MS SQL have scaled much bigger. Just know that there are diminishing returns.
Whatever the scheduler, for the maximum throughput and minimum latency, do not oversubscribe vCPU. Those dual hexcores get guests totaling 12 vCPU. There is no waiting for idle CPU when you effectively have some dedicated to the guest.
Strict co-scheduling, where all vCPUs of a VM are stopped if there is a scheduling skew, has not been used since ESX 2. Relaxed co-scheduling is more of a per vCPU decision. You can measure if CPUs are making more progress than others by %CSTP in esxtop.
Hyper-threading is lying about the number of cores to get a few percent boost. You do not have 24 cores, you have 12. Although, I would feel a little better about fully using those 12 cores for guests with hyper-threading.
