So I downloaded the SQL Server 2008 R2 from here, and updated the 2008 version of the server to 2008 R2. The update process was successful. 
There certainly may be issues with 64 bit versions versus 32 and trying to restore backwards. You might ultimately find the best solution is to build a temporary 64 bit 2008 r2 virtual machine  or clone an existing known good box to do your restore. Instead of trying to force these types of products to your bidding, I've had less frustration doing it the "ms" way. 
(The backup was created in a 64 bit machine while the machine I'm currently working (trying to restore the DB) is a 32 bit one; and I used the correct versions (x86) of setups - server and management studio.)
I needed to restore a database (created in SQL Server 2008 R2 - version 10.50.1600) to a new DB in Server 2008 (version - 10.00.2531). I got the error - Restore failed for Server ....
Then I downloaded the SQL Server 2008 R2 RTM - Management Studio Express from here and tried to update the MSE. It raised the following error!
