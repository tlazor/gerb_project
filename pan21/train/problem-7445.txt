I had the same issue on an X61 with Win 7 RC - Lenovo has not released an updated support package that enables the Fn keys on Win 7 yet (though I'm sure it'll be out by Oct 22nd).
After you hear the beep that notifies the switch of the power source - the brightness controls are functional again.
Good (possibly better workaround) - Win+X to bring up Mobility Center, and then adjust the brightness slider.
It does not always work, unfortunately. When it does not, there is no brightness control in the Mobility Center window (Win+X ) at all. A reboot fixes that, but as someone who reboots infrequently - I'd love to use a different solution.
My HP Compaq nw8440 disables brightness setting after wake up. When I press Fn+9 and Fn+f10 icons shows but the gauge bar and the brightness doesn't change. Reboot solves it. I'm using Windows 7 Enterprise.
Lenovo N585 Win10- right click AMD Catalyst icon on taskbar, left click control center - select desktop management drop-down, select desktop color, adjust brightness. My temporary solution.
I have this problem as well, it occurs after hibernating or sleeping. I noticed that on certain occasions this can be resolved by unplugging the power source and plugging it back.
