I was having the same problem using PHPMailer, and here's what fixed the problem for me: set the Sender (this is different and distinct from the "From") to a valid email account for the domain you are sending the email from. This causes PHPMailer to properly set the "envelope-from" information so that the email passes SPF and Sender-ID validation.  Without doing this, the "envelope-from" is an OS level user id and server combination which will not be verifiable.  I hope this helps.
I'm sending out emails using PHPMailer through an SMTP server that I control, and I have DKIM and SPF set up and working properly, however, when I send a test email to my gmail account it goes to the spam folder immediately and claims that my email is similar to messages detected by their spam filters.
As a first step remove any headers that identify the sending system as being PHPMailer. If that doesn't help then look at the message itself and try to modify it so that it looks less like spam, as your message may be riding the edge.
The headers sent by Outlook and PHPMailer, or any other mailer, are different. Many spam filters will automatically increase a message's spam score when such headers are detected. This is presumably because they are so prevalent in spam.
There are two servers here: my_smtp_server_domain.com which is the SMTP server, and ml.my_smtp_server_domain.com which is a mailing app (for legit newsletters for people who have double OP'd in).
However, if I then use Outlook to send the exact same message through the same SMTP server, it doesn't get filtered as spam.
