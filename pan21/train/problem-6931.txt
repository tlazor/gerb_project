It should be easy to setup a shell script that repeats copying a file on the server and recalculates the checksum of each copy. After it fills your sever, you check all the checksums by hand.
My experience is that raid controllers that have Promise written on the outside are broken on the inside. Get rid of it. Sometimes even the Promise controllers only make a driver driven software raid. Try Areca or so. 
If you plan for raid, put a pricetag on your data. Then put a pricetag on not being able to work a few days. Then check for prices of good raid controllers. 
You say that other PCs can copy files to each other, but that doesn't mean the server network card (or driver) isn't fritzy.
Chkdsk has always been my first-line tool for fixing NTFS. Comes in the box, and works like a charm. Full disclosure: I very seldom have the need to verify filesystems, so I've never needed another tool.
Out of the 100 or so servers I manage I've needed to use it once and that time was because of problems caused by a bad data sync on the SAN, not the RAID card. I'm with everyone else saying ditch the Promise card and get something better.
What is the make of your drives? a priori, I'd suspect the Promise card. They have a very long and painful history of absolutely shitty products, with abysmal performance, data corruption, buggy drivers, and various combinations of all of these.
You don't need to cough money for ram testing tools, because memtest86+ rules and is free. To test the filesystem integrity you could use afick, it works fine for me (but I didn't used it much on windows, though).
Are you sure it's the RAID controller? I've experienced similar problems that had to do with the network drivers / card failing.
