    #"Inserted Day of Week" = Table.AddColumn(#"Inserted Week of Year", "DayOfWeek", each Date.DayOfWeek([Input Date]), type number),
PQ has built-in date conversion functions that usually just work without any coding. In the PQ Editor, just select the column and set the Data Type to Date.
    #"Added Day of Week Name" = Table.AddColumn(#"Inserted Day of Week", "Day of Week Name", each Date.ToText([Input Date], "dddd"))
I have English Excel, but I was able to process an equivalent date string "Thursday, June 05 2014" and add columns to get Week of Year an Week Day (number and text).  
I would use the Power Query Add-In for this.  From Excel 2016, Power Query is built in to the Data ribbon under "Get and Transform" section.
You can build this just by clicking around in the PQ UI, or here is a sample PQ script to get you going (assumes your input is in a table called "Table1", with a Column heading of "Input Date").
    #"Inserted Week of Year" = Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type", "WeekOfYear", each Date.WeekOfYear([Input Date]), type number),
