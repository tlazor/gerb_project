The way that works for me is making link reference explicitly by copying [Ctrl+C] the wole number (or part of it) of Figure (3.1 in above case) and then insertion it in to test using [paste special] > hyperlink + unformatted text. This will create OLE_LINK that is also REF type. 
It has something to do with your numbering list. See this thread http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/cross-referencing-issues-unwanted-extra-spaces/1fedeb0a-9a89-4cdb-8fe1-ec252faaa39d
I can permanently remove the spaces by right-clicking the field -> edit field -> click on "Suppress all non-delimiter chars". As this has to be done individually for every cross reference field, I am looking for a way to apply this setting to the cross references insertion field, which is called "Ref". When I change the "Ref" field in the fields menu, the setting is lost upon the next insertion. Please help me with this. Thanks!  
This type of reference does not work when You have numbering format including some additions as chapter level. example 
When inserting a cross reference (insert -> Cross Reference -> Heading -> Heading (no context) -> ok), the field shows the specific heading number, but 2 spaces are inserted after the field.
