I understand that something like sed, awk or grep with some redirection operators might be better suited to this task, but I'd like to know if I can use vim to do this.
Something like copy matched regex lines into register "m. Then I'd be able to do a "mp where ever else I need this.
I have some lines of text that follow a pattern and some that don't. I'd like to copy the lines that follow this pattern and then copy/yank them into a register so that I can paste them as is someplace else.
However this has one problem. What happens if the m register is not empty when you start. Well you will end up with what ever you put into the register last time plus all the stuff you appended.
You can use "Myy (capital letter M) to append into register m. This allows you write a global command to yank all lines matching def.*$ and yank all the lines into the m register. Then all you have to do is paste the m register to get the contents "mp
The above global command tell you to find all lines that match the pattern def.*$ and execute the command "Myy in normal mode.
