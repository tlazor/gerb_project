Your server is as secure as your weakest link. Your weakest link is probably not your web server or OS (in Linux vs. BSD), but your web application.
FreeBSD and Apache are both well-tested.  FreeBSD ships out of the box in a relatively secure configuration and requires only minimal additional hardening, and Apache has been beaten on for 15+ years now: Many of the "easy" holes have been found, and what's left is largely a matter of proper configuration and a well-written application that doesn't leave holes for attackers to penetrate your security.
The HTTP Server is just one aspect of hosting a sensitive website. Hiawatha looks like it has some nice features but if it were me I'd stick with something less esoteric and follow a blueprint like the NSA's Guide to the Secure Configuration of
I would also suggest reading through the NSA Guidance Jason linked to, as well as the PCI-DSS linked here (the former talks about securing an individual machine, the latter about general security of an environment and handling sensitive data) -- Adhering to those principles will go a long way toward helping you design a stable, secure environment.
I was reading about Hiawatha and I was wondering if really Freebsd+Hiawatha could be considered safer than Linux+Lighttpd or any other webserver.
If I were to have a very sensitive website (and in fact I do have one that's subject to US HIPAA law and the PCI Data Security Standards) I would build it on top of FreeBSD, Apache, an appropriate language (PHP, Ruby, etc.) and the skills of a good developer who knows how to build secure web applications.
Moreover, if you were to have to host a very sensitive website, which software platform would you use?
