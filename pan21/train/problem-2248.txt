May or may not work, but... you could try setting /tmp to not be writable by users, and set export TMPDIR="$HOME/tmp" (assuming $HOME is encrypted) somewhere that will be used in the env of all sessions (like, /etc/profile, perhaps?). I think many things should respect the TMPDIR environment variable, but all of them won't necessarily honor it.
Of course, data will not be readable after written... it is lost as is it being written... that is what is for /dev/null designed.
Also if after /tmp is created and mounted, you just mount over it any path that is an encrypted container, it will do the trick.
If you are sure all your apps only write to "controlled" paths, try first with mount over a path that has a mount on it (it overrides the mount until unmount).
You could try to run firefox in a selinux sandbox which will not only prevent /tmp from other users but will also prevent your home files from firefox :-)
Not sure how useful would that be on Ubuntu but after some customization works fine on my Fedora (15).
After 1 the files/folders seen on /mnt/MyHDD are on drive sda on first partition, after 2 the files/folders seen on /mnt/MyHDD are on sdb partition 2, after 3 the files/folders seen on /mnt/MyHDD are on drive sda on first partition, after 4 Â¿? it depends on what was mounted there before 1.
