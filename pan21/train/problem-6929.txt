You often just flex your Google-Fu and find the error/behavior/similar problem, figure out what component could be causing it, Google that, form a hypothesis, Google some more...  If you're lucky, you land on some obscure document somewhere that explains what you're looking for or how things work.  Failing that, you just experiment using whatever knowledge you've gained along your journey.
If you do this enough times, and blow up a few computers along the way, you gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between what components do what things, and where those things are recorded in the registry.  Not everyone is up to the task.  Sometimes it just takes brute-force trial-and-error, or long hours of comparing the state of one machine to another, changing a setting, and seeing what happens.
The registry is just the central place where settings are stored.  ANY program can read from or write to it.  Many of the values it contains are only meaningful to the application that created them.  Some are very well documented, and some are very poorly documented or not at all.  If you work with the registry a lot, you get to know where certain things are supposed to be, and which branches of the tree do different things.  Once you know that, you have an idea of where to start looking when things go wrong.
I suppose what I'm trying to say is that there is no manual that spells everything out for you.  The registry is a complex beast and it just takes years of practice to be good enough to just zip right to the spot that's giving you trouble.  Even then, there's still a lot of guesswork and hunches involved.
