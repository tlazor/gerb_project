You could use iTerm like I do, then you can set your keybindings in preferences.  You also get a whole bunch of other features.  Highly recommended to Mac developers.
If you're using the OSX terminal, go into Terminal->Preferences and go to Settings. Under the Keyboard subtab, make sure that your "control cursor left" and "control cursor right" are set to the default values (\033[5D and \033[5C, respectively).
I don't think that this is an issue with your bash_profile or any of the bash config files; I'm pretty sure that bash doesn't configure cursor movement. (Actually, that's not quite right. Bash can interpret key commands, but I wouldn't imagine that that's your problem here.)
Additionally, why not post your .bashrc and .bash_profile here? We might be able to find an error, if there is one. Again, I don't think that any of the bash config files actually control cursor movement, but I might not be fully correct. (For instance, the up and down keys in Bash recall history, which /bin/sh does not do.)
