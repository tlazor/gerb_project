I'm new to Juniper and need some troubleshooting help. I have a Juniper SRX100 and a WIN 10 PC connected, but they can't seem to ping each other, although they are on the same subnet (192.168.10.0/24). Can you please let me know, why they might not be able to ping each other?
I have enabled interface fe0/0/3.0 and given the address 192.168.10.1/24. The port is enable. I have commit the following configuration:
This is an SRX, your interface or the VLANs it carries must be placed into a security zone. That zone will have a stanza that permits traffic (like ECMP) with a destination address of the SRX itself. Here's an example, you can use either statement. If you use the top one, any interface placed into the zone will be pingable. If you use the bottom, only the explicit interface will permit it. It will not summarize the two!
All network adapter are disable, except the local area connection to SRX100.  I've set a Static IP for PC.  
Now, as others have said, please make sure the Windows 10 system allows ping as well. If this SRX is meant to permit and route traffic through it, you're going to need multiple zones, and rules to permit traffic both between and within those zones.
