End user experience is not the only consideration, and as others have pointed out, there is an ecosystem of products supporting SecurID. Looking over the IT fence to the security guys, however, SecurID never seemed particularly easy to manage.
As for "something you are" component, it does seem that the current set of widely available fingerprint readers may not be as securely implemented as a CSO would require.
I've worked a bit with the ActivIdentity 4Tres AAA solution and using it for Citrix remote access.  It allows the use of the usual PIN-entry fobs/cards, this single button credit card-sized generator, and also SMPP text messaging.  Since the tokens can be pricey, it may be desirable to use SMPP messaging to deliver the one-time password to the cell phone registered with the Active Directory user.
I'm also a fan of one time password type tokens like RSA's SecurID as they are basically quite simple and generally easy to manage at large scales. The traditional key-fob token provides a good level of authentication that is better than plain old passwords but they fail to authenticate both ends of the transaction and unless they are wrapped in a decent outer layer that ensures mutual authentication the overall system isn't robust. Using such tokens over any unsecured network without a secure wrapper is just asking for a Man-In-The middle attack. Active USB type tokens \ Smart Cards do a much better job of this but they are much harder to support - resetting\re-issuing\initial provisioning are all a lot more work but for high value situations they are a much better solution. 
As an end user, I found the Yubikey (http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey/) much easier to use than the RSA SecurID (http://www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=1156).
