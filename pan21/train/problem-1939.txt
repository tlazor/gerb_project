Then set up an auto-forward to your new address for any emails that contain the words "real person" in the subject.
The good thing here is that there is no maintenance, and you don't have to worry about storage on the server etc.
Then, you need to setup an auto-forward/reply for all addresses you receive mail from that you have earlier communicated with. You could auto-forward to your new address and check if you want to reply or you could auto-reply with the updated id (and keep a CC to your new address too).
You could set up an auto-reply saying "I am having a hard time with spam - if you are a real person, please reply with the words 'real person' in the SUBJECT to ensure the email gets through to me."
I would just do a auto responder with your new address. Most spam comes from forged addresses or unmonitored mailboxes so it is unlikely that they will get your new address.
That way, you are not giving away your new address to spammers but you will receive genuine replies from real friends that are trying to get hold of you.  Plus, no maintenance once you have set the two rules up.  No extra signups required and no additional costs.
This requires you to have a backup of all your earlier sent-mails and the ability to process incoming mails as required. Just an idea since you say working with the mail-server is possible.
I would push your new email to use google apps, as the interface and settings are better than anything else I've seen.
It would be great if you could setup a data-base of all e-mail addresses to which you have sent mail till now (that should cover your set of interest closely).
