Ususally the init.d scripts use files to store the PIDs of the daemons started, e.g. /var/run/httpd.pid or something similar. It can be that either the script stores the wrong PID, or a stale PID, or there is a permission problem, and the script cannot create the file in the first place.
For debugging, you can also try sending using the apachectl graceful command -- it'll reload the config and restart children processes without taking down the main process.  (the problem is that it means that there's a few config changes that won't take effect, but unless you're doing tuning, it probably won't matter)
I'm guessing that you have two different init scripts starting apache up, and that the different init scripts are using different pid-files.
If that still doesn't work, check your webserver's error logs, to see if there's anything useful in there.
The init.d file is typically just a shell script -- it's likely calling apachectl to start and stop the process.  Check to see what command it's sending to stop the process, and see what happens when you try running whatever command it uses directly, without the init.d file.
I'm guessing that you have a stale PID file from a previous launch of Apache.  I don't have access to a CentOS system, but on my Fedora 11 machine this file is in /var/run/httpd/httpd.pid - you can check your location by searching for "pidfile" in /etc/init.d/httpd (I'm assuming you are using a version of Apache installed from RPM; if not and you have apache in /usr/local/apache2 or similar, the PID file goes in /usr/local/apache2/logs).
