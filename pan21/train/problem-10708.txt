The idea was actually used for server rooms at one point in time. Today we understand that in-rack (small deployments), hot/cold isles, raise floor ventilation, and the 'newest' open-circulation designs are more efficient and have a considerably better ROI than putting your DC in a commercial size refrigerator. 
Either way, I'd use a temperature sensor in the room to notify you of a cooling failure.  Black Box makes a good one.
Here's an article that may help - http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/10/14/google-raise-your-data-center-temperature/
Its usually recommended to keep the server room between 68-77F.  Although I've heard that Google is recommending 80F.
I don't know what temperature range a walk-in cooler would operate at, however, your typical server room doesn't need to be all that cool.  Good ventilation is important.  I'd think a walk-in cooler would overkill compared to just using a portable server room AC or a dedicated unit on the roof.
Servers already have built in aircon,  hence all of those fans.   I use an 'ucoustic'  active rack cabinet which has a typical front to back server airflow that is augmented by baffles and a couple of large fans in the rear doors that push warm air into a couple of ducts that exit through a wall vent.  Very effective (don't remember the kw ratings supplied by manufacture but think around 4.5).  In winter I recycle the warm air back into the office and save on heating bills.
