An alternative method of achieving the end goal is to use the various slide navigation options in presentation view, or re-order the slides as was mentioned. My favourite navigation trick is to type the number of the slide I want, and press ENTER. If I want slide 6, I type 6 ENTER. That's it. So easy.
For a more sophisticated method of branching that doesn't tie you into a specific order of presentation, place an object on the slide and add a hyperlink to the desired slide. Want to go from slide 3 to slide 6? Click the object. Want to go from slide 3 to slide 4? Don't click the image. Place the corresponding return hyperlinked object on the destination slide.
The current Office 365 releases of PowerPoint offer another option - Slide Zooms. On the Insert tab, click Zoom > select zoom type
After showing some animation introduction on slide number 2, I want Powerpoint to automatically move to slide number 6. Is there any way to for me to tell Powerpoint to automatically move to a specific slide without having to trigger a click? Thanks.
The Zoom feature creates hyperlinked thumbnails of selected slides on a summary slide. Clicking the thumbnail jumps to that part of the presentation. Getting to the end of that part returns you to the summary slide. I organize my presentations into sections, so the Section Zoom has been very helpful in casually moving around the presentation, and is more visually interesting than a text list of hyperlinks.
Note: This won't work if the user is using the keyboard to advance the slide.  It will work if he or she clicks the mouse anywhere on the slide to advance it.
Use any of the above-mentioned strategies (including Custom Shows) to go to your desired next slide.
The way to do this is to create an invisible object over the entire slide - with a hyperlink to the slide you want to go to (slide 6).
