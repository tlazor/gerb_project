You can configure the GPIO to slightly higher currents as @Milliways mentioned. But there is an overall limit for the combined current for all GPIOs that you can't exceed anyway.
NOTE this is not current limited, but if you try to draw more operation is not supported, and may damage the chip.
If you want to drive the LEDs to full power (eg for illumination, or to be visible as indicators in daylight), you must buffer the GPIOs. Use a transistor, or use some sort of buffering IC that is designed to drive those currents.
I was able to connect three LEDs to my Raspberry Pi without any problem. The LEDs glowed pretty bright. I did connect them in parallel though, as suggested by Wilf. 
There are some worthwhile comments above (although you should NEVER run LEDs without current limiting, and LEDs should not put in parallel.
The GPIO pins cannot supply 50mA, the source and sink current is configurable from 2 mA up to 16 mA.
Modern LEDs are efficient enough that you can use them as indicators even at 2mA. It's safe to drive them directly from GPIO if you calculate the resistors based on a 1-2mA current.
