Do you know what this connection is and if it can be used as an alternate means to connect the device to a PC? See the exposed 12 pins below.
I am open to connecting it a PC or as a secondary drive on my laptop which supports two harddrive bays and is sata.
The USB cable looks like a standard mini-USB or micro-USB cable. If you have another USB device with a matching cable you can try it, otherwise you could buy a replacement cable to see if it works.
I have a Western Digital My Passport 500Gb external Harddrive where the USB connection on the drive seems to have worn out. I am trying to retrieve the data for a friend.
Its very complicated.  Check this out.  I don't know why you'd want to go through all the trouble though...
The label on the hard drive claims it's a SATA drive, but the connectors on the drive do not look like standard SATA connectors. The link posted by @wizlog discusses how you might build a custom cable to connect this drive to a standard SATA interface. Looks like a lot of work, and risky if you wire it wrong. The drive would have to contain important and irreplaceable data before I would go to that effort. Let's hope it's just a bad cable.
I am considering getting another cable as it is difficult to tell if the cable or the drive connection or both are worn out.. My question is about the other pins and alternate means of accessing the drive.
