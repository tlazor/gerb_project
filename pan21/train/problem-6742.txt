if you want finer control than all or nothing you should look at the access controls in the apache docs which is basically
This could be done with any language, jsp' asp' php. You only need a bootstraper file (namely index.php, index.jsp, index.asp) in the web directory root, any other resource is loaded into the application via include directives and library path settings.
But I think your real problem is that you have a lot of folders inside your web directory root (/var/www) and you do not want anyone to access theses directories. So why are they here?
You will avoid a lot of information disclosure problems with that (except for all the stuff you could find attached to js libraries packages, be sure to suspend php execution on js assets paths).
Apache cannot access anything before the DocumentRoot except if you set some aliases, but you do not need aliases. all the things that do not require derect access via an url should not be under the DocumentRoot. Most CMS ignores this basic rule simply because they want to be easily deployed on very restrictive hosts policies (where you only have access tco the document root via ftp).
