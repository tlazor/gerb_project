I'm currently writing a book about Data Science in Higher Education, and the following methodologies are the ones I am including:
Okay, I eventually found what I was looking for in the Data Mining Community. There seem to be two candidates, CRISP-DM which comes from SPSS originally but is "Cross-Industry", and SEMMA which comes from SAS. They are both pretty much what I was looking for.
Then there are several resources out there that will come up as results to more targeted searches, such as machine learning paradigms, recommender systems paradigms, etc. Data Science is a large and varied field, and you'll find many resources out there for each subsection of it. As far as I know, there isn't one book that covers it all. 
Data Science Design Patterns by Mosaic talks about, you guessed it, data science design patterns. This is quite useful to get a sense of common design patterns. They are also working on releasing a book on the same subject. 
In the meantime, take a look at The Field Guide To Data Science by Booz Allen Hamilton. This guide talks about data science processes and frameworks.
These are some of the more elementary topics in statistical analysis (which you could argue is predictive analytics which you could argue is data science), and thus I would suspect they are also the more common.
