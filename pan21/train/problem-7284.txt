I have a php script that I am calling every 1 minute using CPanel to set up the Cron Job. The nature of the script means that it could overrun for just over the minute so I need to know how to stop the next one running if the first one hasn't completed.
I have a VPS running CENTOS 5.5 and have access to WHM and CPanel. I have never used Linux before (only just got the server yesterday) so I have no idea what I am doing and would appreciate some help if possible. If I need to provide more information please let me know (I don't know what info you would need at the moment).
Your questions says "I either didn't understand the answer or it didn't apply to me", but you don't say in what way. Please be more specific.
Please see Process Management. You will probably want to use a lock file. You can use flock for example.
I am curious if implementing something with ps will solve the issue. Would simple ps -e | grep script_name.php | awk '{print $4}' be sufficient? It definitely will tell you if the script is running, no need to check if someone killed it beforehand. How creating and then removing a lock file is better/faster than this? 
I know this question has been asked already but I either didn't understand the answer or it didn't apply to me.
