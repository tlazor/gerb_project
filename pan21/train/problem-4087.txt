Boot the laptop into Gparted Live (CD) with the non-appearing hard drive installed. If the drive appears in gparted live, simple create new partition tables and/or rebuilt the filesystem; apply changes, and then reboot the PC back into Windows. As long as the drive is not defective, it should now appear in Windows.
It is usually casued because either the hard drive is broken, or because the hard drive is unformatted.
Try a different hdd. Using the oem Seagate 500GB drive in a caddy didn't work in my L501x for me either. Something with spinup time or voltage I guess. There is a firmware update fix for the Seagate on Dell drivers and software page. The firmware update is easy, but I haven't tried the Seagate in the caddy since updating it. I have used a Samsung Spinpoint M8 1TB and that works fine for movies and I have swapped other ssd's in the caddy with no problems. (You didn't ask, but the xps won't boot from a caddy. If you want a dual boot, with a system on the main hdd and a second on the caddy, the main hdd must be the boot drive. If you image a second system on the caddy, after installing a dual boot second system, you'll need to run your install disk "startup repair" to fix the boot. googgle tutorials on sevenforums)
p.s. to troubleshoot whether it is an issue with the hard drive or not, I highly recommend trying a separate verified working hard drive into the caddy and seeing if it displays in Windows.
