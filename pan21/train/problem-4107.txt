My server has hiccups, too. I found this tool: http://www.latencytop.org/. Unfortunately my hiccups are not occurring regularly.
Rebooting makes the problem go away for a while.  This most recent time it took six days to come back.  I'm not sure if that's consistent or not.
There is nothing in dmesg or /var/log/messages that seems remotely relevant or in any way coincides with the hiccups.  It does not appear to be an issue with a hard drive, as I would expect iowait to be prominent during the unresponsive period if that were the case, but it's not.  It feels unlikely to be a hardware problem, as the hiccups are pretty regular.  I've been unable to time them down to milliseconds, but it's a pretty consistent 30/4/30/4/30/4.
I have a RHEL5 workstation that has recently started to "hiccup".  About every thirty seconds, it apparently completely stops execution for about 4 seconds.  Seemingly nothing runs during that period.  Long term processes seem to catch up to their input, but new processes simply don't get started.
I had initially suspected that the problem might be related to the nVidia video driver module, but I shut down X Windows and removed the module, without change in the symptoms.
