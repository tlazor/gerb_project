Then, after logging out, you login back again with the credentials you want (the "official ones"). After that, the Onedrive for Business sync client will re-sync your files.
You will have to use another Office App (say Word) to logout of your current account (even if Word says you are logged into your business Account). Use Start -> Account in that app to find your current login and options regarding your Office Account. 
Does anyone know how to clear the credentials associated with a user's OneDrive for Business sync app, or at least some kind of work around that doesn't involve having to recreate the user's Windows profile or restore to a previous system state?
I can't believe Microsoft made something that should be simple so difficult. With Dropbox you can do the same thing very easily.
As expected, my OneDrive for Business sync app was then unable to authenticate with my Office 365 account and gave me a "unable to sync" error.
Microsoft's SharePoint support team were also unable to resolve the issue during a remote support session of my PC and I ended up simply restoring my PC to a previous state. This is not acceptable as it may not be an option for a user.
After realising there was no "log out" option in the sync app itself, I went on to try the following steps:
We are using the OneDrive for business sync app to synchronize our document libraries in SharePoint with our PCs in the office.
Recently, I came across a situation when testing where I entered my personal Hotmail credentials instead of the organizational account that had permission to access a document library. I knew it was not going to work but wanted to see what would happen so I could support our users if they ever made a similar error.
I had the same issue and found two sets of credentials for OneDrive in Credential Manager.  I deleted the incorrect set and rebooted.  My OneDrive now syncs to the correct library.
