Adjusting the brightness nearly always helps to at least reduce the humming, or change its frequency to make it less irritating. The exact best brightness level can only be found by experimentation. E.g. start with 100%, reduce one step, wait 2-3 secs and listen... You'll find a couple of brightness levels that will sound better than the rest.
Obviously it's NOT a CRT, the model no that you kindly posted says FP at the end (mind you that is if I was too lazy to google it)... Pay attention folks.  Aside from that, the thing is a tiny LCD - Buy a new decent sized one unless yer broke.  Yes the buzz is indicative of an impending failure but it could be in five minutes or five years.  It's Christmas time, spoil yerself and recycle this one properly.
If its an LCD, try lowering the brightness setting to 60% (which is usually easier on the eyes also) as they usually leave the shop cranked right up.
If its a CRT, try degaussing it (it'll be an option upon the on screen menu built into it usually). That sometimes used to help for me, anyhow.
LCD monitor's backlight is a fluorescent tube (The specs specifically say CCFL). The backlight's power inverter sometimes hums, or makes other noises. This is only indicative of low quality of the some of its components, usually it does not mean the monitor is about to fail soon.
