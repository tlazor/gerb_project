Is anyone familiar with why the windows dhcp server wouldn't be responding to dhcp requests from the relay agent?
The configuration with the scopes is as basic as it can get due to being a test environment and I'm wanting to verify if windows would be able to work as a dhcp server in the production environment rather than a simple test environment.
Here's the scenario. I have a test environment configured with 2 windows 2k3 domain controllers. One of the two is handling DHCP. I've set up 2 scopes in DHCP to handle two separate subnets. On a Linux (RHEL 5) server I have dhcrelay running that is listening on Subnet 192.168.2.0 and forwarding to the DHCP server on 192.168.1.10. I have setup a windows xp machine on the 192.168.2.0 subnet that is requesting DHCP. The dhcrelay on the linux server picks up the request and forwards it to the windows dhcp server. Unfortunately though the windows DHCP server receives the packet (have done packet captures and verified this), it doesn't respond to the DHCP request from the relay.
