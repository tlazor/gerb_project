I think mysql replication is a nice option. Mysql generate new logs after committing the transaction. So, you will have consistent backups as far as you are using transactions properly.
A better bet is to use an LVM or filesystem that allows you to take snapshots, then lock the entire database for just long enough to take a snapshot, which you can then back up at your leisure.
For InnoDB tables, --single-transaction will ensure that the dump of each table is consistent, but it will not necessarily be consistent with the other tables, since it locks and dumps them one at a time rather than locking them all for the duration of the dump. And you will, of course, have delayed writes waiting for the lock to release if you try to write to a table while it's being dumped.
Mysqldump locks a DB being backed up, so you should consider using a live backup tool like xtrabackup. You will need to use Percona's MySQL build and to convert all your tables to InnoDB. Latest InnoDB plugin from Oracle supports live backup too, can't remember the name of their live backup tool.
This can always be used. However, the option of using system snapshots may not be feasible as it is related to the file system you are using.
One full backup at the beginning, and then you can get the generated binary logs by the replication system. Ever applied binary log file should update the database in a consistent way.
