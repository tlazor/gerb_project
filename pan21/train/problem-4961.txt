(b) A language that you don't know at all. Then you can use a discovery style of working with the students to discover together how to program in that language. 
If you aren't already an experienced teacher, I suggest a lab based system in which students are encouraged to work together and to ask a lot of questions. Active students will learn. Passive ones won't. 
(a) The language you know best. Then you won't be struggling with the language and how to use it, and can focus on the teaching of it. 
I would also strongly anti-recommend PHP and Java; the former was put together in a very hackish manner and will teach them bad habits, and Java is a full-on new BadHabitFactory().createBadHabit().getInstance().getHabitSet() generator.
Depending on your relationship with the students and their general level of background, I'd say you might consider one of the two following options. 
With either method, however, keep in mind that the most important thing is not what you do or say, but what the students do. Your lectures (if you even do that) are far less important than the exercises that they do.
