Once the HW adapter is complete, I've found some open-source Willem software for which I will likely have to write a driver or some type of boilerplate to convert from the parallel port operations into the RPis GPIO bus.  It might be a little slow to bit-bang the GPIOs, but speed is secondary to economy.  With the most recent RPis in the $5-$10 range, that solution will be hard to beat for economy and to breathe new life into some old EPROM chips.
I have an old PCB3b Willem EEPROM programmer.  The parallel port required to program PROMs/EPROMs/EEPROMs requires an ECP-mode parallel port (for bi-directional data transfer) which AFAIK excludes all of the USB-to-Printer devices available which are likely "data-out" only.  Since PCs with a REAL parallel port are becoming more scarce (particularly in my house), I think it might be a doable project to put together a level shifter circuit to convert from the RPi's 3.3V GPIOs to the Willem's 5V bi-directional (though I think the pins are dedicated inputs or outputs) data port.
