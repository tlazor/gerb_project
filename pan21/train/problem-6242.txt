The fundamental problem is that the array was created with an MD superblock at the end, which means the superblocks at the start are still recognisable at their expected offsets.  The only thing that prevents the PV superblock from being parsed is that the MD subsystem grabs the devices first; usually.  Sometimes upper layers take care to yield when another superblock is also detectable, but that can be fragile.
Once you've made sure the array is synced and the filesystem mostly sane, you can disassemble it, nuke the raid superblocks on both disks (read the wipefs manpage carefully, you don't want to nuke PV superblocks by mistake), nuke the PV superblock on one member only, extend your VG onto that, and lvconvert your logical volumes to --type=raid1 --mirrors=1.  Finally, re-run grub-install onto both disks.
Normally these precautions are taken at creation time, but in your case (raid1 with metadata at the end, containing a PV), you can convert to LVM-integrated MD without too much trouble.
You can probably get rid of this error message by modifying your /etc/lvm.conf file to change the filter to reject sdb* and scd* devices, regenrate your initrd, then reboot.
