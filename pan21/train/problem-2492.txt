today I got my icy box hdd to odd upgrade kit and just before I actually put it in, I was wondering whether there is a reason to prefer one slot over the other.
Basically I now have the option to replace the build in HDD with the SSD and put the HDD in the new frame for the ODD bay or other way round. I have disassembled my vaio to its bare parts once already and put it back together so replacing the internal hdd really isn't the issue, its just the internal SATA connector may be a bit faster or maybe there are other reasons to decide which drive goes where.
Before I start however, I'd like to warn you that - if you haven't already bought your caddy - there are two main form factors for caddies: 12,7mm and 9,5mm.. I obviously bought the wrong one... so make sure you get the proper size.
after posting the question I decided to do some research and now - a few hours later, I think I was able to put together a pretty comprehensive list to decide which goes where.
aaand that covers about everything you need to know on that topic. If I have forgotten anything, please comment below. Otherwise have fun with your new fast speed notebook :)
