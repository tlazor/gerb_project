Go into Start, then Control Panel. At the top right type in MOUSE and it will pull up Mouse Settings. Click on "Change mouse click settings" After you click this you will see "Double Click Speed" in the middle of page also
SPEED    SLOW |||||||||| FAST Move the arrow between SLOW and FAST back toward SLOW.  Mine is set on the 3rd ||| from SLOW. Be sure to click APPLY then OK.  
I found when I hibernate my laptop that sometimes the mouse doesn't work right and (what's the point if have to restart the pc/windows?) looking for some other way to enable, I found that in Process-Tab, killing the process EXPLORER.EXE (closes the whole system taskbar and tray) then in Applications-Tab starting New Task EXPLORER.EXE (restarts the taskbar and tray) that this fixed my mouse problems.  (it has also fixed other problems, lockups, etc. in the past is why I tried it, so you can also try it on other problems too)
I had a similar problem, with double-clicks when I clicked once, or the wrong button activating, etc. I fixed it by restoring the primary & secondary mouse button locations (I had them reversed in Control Panel, due to a right wrist injury).  Windows 7 SP 1, updates applied.
You might try making sure the keyboard filter is installed. I had two systems exhibiting this behavior, both had USB keyboards and USB mice. Installing the correct keyboard filter fixed both. Usually this is on the original install CD in the location where other mfg specific drivers are. In my case both machines had updated KB filter drivers on mfg web site.
