If you connect to a network such as at Starbucks, Panera, McDonalds, etc, your HTTP file request will be met with an HTML login or "agree to our terms of service" page. Any programmatic solution that would check the web file for updates would see that this landing page is different than the most recent local copy of your file, thereby replacing your local copy with the landing page HTML data.
Of course, if your file has a certain kind of distinguishable header that would realistically never occur in any other web-accessible file, you could code your own solution that would check the HTTP response for a header of the same format and ignore the results if the response data doesn't contain a valid header format; however, due to the specificity of your request, you're unlikely to find a suitable non-custom solution.
Honestly, if you're really interested in making this happen, you could probably persuade a computer science professor at your local university or community college to have a student or students do it for a project (again assuming your file has an identifiable header).
