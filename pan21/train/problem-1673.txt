Have a look at the Microsoft iSCSI Target (free).  This allows you to use a standard Windows Server 2008 R2 machine as a SAN.  Jose Baretto (Principal Program Manager with the File Server Foundation team at Microsoft) gives a lot of useful information on setup and configuration on his blog.  Depending on your needs, this may be a good solution.
PS:  I'm totally game for rolling my own, but FreeNAS and OpenFiler have not been kind to me in the past.
It seems like the pay to play price on SAN is prohibitively expensive for dabbling purposes. Other than graphical files for our online catalog and some purchase orders, we don't shuffle a lot of hard files.  Therefore, I'm on the fence about whether or not this is something we should look at dropping serious coin for.
I would take a standard server, connect it to a Norco disk enclosure (such as the DS-24E) to pack it full of storage space, then install FreeNAS on it.  I would not use OpenFiler because the snapshots cause a huge performance penalty.
Every few months I start looking into the possibility of consolidating down to one unit that doesn't suck and that can also work as an iSCSI SAN.  We have a few minor one-off VMs on ESX that I'd like to move onto a SAN as opposed to local storage.
Our little snowboarding company currently has three NetGear ReadyNAS units that I am ready to put through a wall.
The Iomega IX4 little storage cubes are VMware certified. They seem to do okay, I think the RAID controller is underpowered IMHO. I ran mine in RAID10 and got some pretty decent performance out of it. Rebuilds took a while, a lot longer than I would have expected. It can double as both a NAS and an iSCSI target.
Can anyone make any recommendations that might help me drop in something that would help me better make my decision...without the overhead of say, selling my soul to a vendor who will call me every other day?
