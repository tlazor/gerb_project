You obviously haven't shown your complete data model but it looks wrong that each user is linked to classes through the user_klasses relation but then you query classes using a profile_id field on the Klass. Firstly you probably want to query the profile_id on the UserKlass model (the profile_id on Klass looks like it refer to the teacher's profile) but you should probably put the klasses relation on the Profile model (or whatever you call it).
You mention that you would rather not create extra models but I would consider creating a model for Teacher, Student and for Parent. It is not really that much more work but will probably keep the separation between the concepts much cleaner in the long run (as per Damien's comments). I personally would also use names like TeacherRole and ParentRole or TeacherFacet.
I would also consider keeping the cardinality as has_one unless you need to deal with the possibility that a user needs more than one teacher profile (possibly because they teach in more than one places) or more than one parent profile (maybe they have multiple children).
You probably don't want to remove the teacher record if a class is deleted, they may be teaching other classes after all. However you probably want to delete UserKlass if the Klass (or User for that matter) is deleted. Likewise it would make sense to delete the Profile record when a User is deleted.
