I created a vlan in Juniper qfx3600 switch by specifying just VLAN name. When I tried to commit the configuration I got an error saying "need L2domain configured". I asked with  my collegue, he said you must provide vlan id, when I specified VLAN-id to the created vlan the commit was successful. But the documentations I read says VLAN automatically will be assosciated with VLAN ID if one is not provided by the user. 
I got confused by all of these, can anyone please tell me which is right and why the commit was successfull after I provided VLAN ID but not before that.
Juniper would never be able to automatically associate a VLAN name to a VLAN tag by default. If you just specify a VLAN by name, there isn't any way to figure out what VLAN that traffic belongs to. 
However, you are using a QFX3500, and I cannot find a similar statement in the QFX range documentation. Here, Juniper states (2):
Because the 802.1Q tag is number based, Customer A and Customer C would be able to communicate while Customer B would not be able to talk to either other customer.
The documentation for the Juniper EX series switches indeed mentions the possibility of creating a VLAN without specifying a VLAN id (1):
I'm not sure about the Juniper method of assigning VLAN tags but I hope this helps clear up why you shouldn't rely on autoconfiguration for that.
802.1Q tracks VLANs based on ID (number) not name, so this would be an awkward way to program a switch.  Example:
