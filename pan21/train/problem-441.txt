My understanding about Windows XP CD keys is that you can't mix and match retail and OEM keys. You need to use an OEM disc with an OEM key.
Otherwise (with Vista, maybe with XP), there are legal ways of extending the 30 or 90 day trial period. 
One thing that I've run into is that the license key on the Dells we get is just a license.  It doesn't activate windows at all, at least any of the versions I've tried.  However, the Dell Windows install CDs are pre-pidded never prompt for a key.  If you can, try to locate the original restore disks.  While vendor specific, they are still fairly generic.  A restore disc that came from that vendor with a different computer may also work.
You doubled checked the product key, can I suggest that you triple check! I recently searched a bunch of ways around a similar issue, turned out that I had misread an 8 as a B! A bit dim of me, but easily done. 
Given the circumstances, and assuming you can trust your relative to be discreet, I'd just use one of your MSDN keys to install it.  You can always use the machine for development work next time you visit.
