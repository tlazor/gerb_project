Some mail servers are configured to not only provide their own certificate for authentication by the sender (i.e. your Postfix) but also to request a certificate from the sender. This is usually optional, i.e. the TLS connection will be accepted even if the sender does not provide such a certificate to authenticate itself. And this is what caused the message "Client did not present a certificate".
If you really want to provide a client certificate you need to explicitly configure at in Postfix with the relevant smtp_* settings (not smtpd_*), i.e. smtp_tls_cert_file etc. See the documentation for details. 
It's not clear why you have done this, as this is not what you said you want. Perhaps it came from an erroneous Internet tutorial?
The cliÃ«nt did not use a TLS client certificate to authenticate itself to the server for mutual TLS  which is very common and no reason to worry, unless you want/need to do mutual TLS
But the message you refer to is not about receiving mail by your server but about sending mail from your server to another server, i.e. receiving by the other server. In this case usually only the certificate of the receiving mail server gets checked (i.e. the other one) by the sending system (i.e. your Postfix), if TLS is involved at all (your setting considers this optional, i.e. smtp_tls_security_level = may).
The server supports TLS and the client chose to negotiate a secure TLS connection, all is good there. 
You have only configured the use of a certificate for Postfix in the role of the server (i.e. receiving a mail). These are the smtpd_* settings.
