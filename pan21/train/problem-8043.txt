Just be sure that the fans operation is controlled by component's actual temperature and not by RPM tables.
See http://www.comairrotron.com/high_altitude_cooling.shtml for more information on air density/altitude calculations, however many motherboards have a PID controller built-in that modulates the speed of the DC fan motors to maintain CPU temperature, automatically. If your motherboard doesn't include this, I'd wonder if you're using the right one for such a sophisticated application, but there are third-party PC mods that also have a temperature controller that drive chassis fans, typically for the desktop form-factor (e.g. http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=11&name=Controller-Panels)
Are there any rules of thumb or guidelines on how much faster fans have to spin at altitude (due to lower air density) to provide adequate cooling?  Or if I know that my server's fans are going at 50% at sea level, what % will they be running at 10,000 feet?
You don't need to make any special accommodations for the server directly; but any ancillary cooling systems need to be sized properly for the conditions. If it's just a server or two, nothing special needed. If it's even a small data center, be sure to contract HVAC people who know the differences.
10,000 feet is nothing extraordinary, just over 3,000 meters.  Lots of cities in Peru are above that level and don't have any higher reliability issue about fans.  I've done some work at twice that altitude and I would be surprised if there was an issue even there.
