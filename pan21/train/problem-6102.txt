If you have access to 10 layer 3 switches you can certainly make this work.  Treat each trailer as if it is a campus building with local internet.  choose the trailer with the NAS as the core of the network and wire up each trailer to that core switch.
At the core switch i would just use the same VLAN for the Routed VLAN between each of the trailer switches to keep the configuration down.  
I think the typical way to handle it would be a router in every trailer with three subnets:  one goes to a switch for a trailer LAN, one goes to a campus backbone LAN for access to server, one goes to the LTE device for that trailer. A lot of work for ten tiny LANs but it wouldn't be so bad.  
Because most of the LAN traffic will be file sharing to the NAS it makes sense to connect each trailer directly to the trailer with the NAS as it reduces the number of hops needed to get to the NAS.  Also if want to make the network resilient you can use two cables to connect each trailer to the core trailer and bond them together using LACP.   
I suggest configuring dynamic routing between the trailer switches and the core switch so that each trailer switch knows about the subnets at each other trailer.  Otherwise you will have to configure static routing for each subnet on each switch which is a pain in the ass.
Simpler alternative - use both the wired and wireless ethernet on each computer.  The wireless is for internet access - connects to the LTE device in the trailer.  The wired is for access to the local resources, servers, printers, etc.  The wired port will not have a default gateway.  If you can get DHCP configured to deal with things correctly it should be very easy.  
Wire each switch in the trailer to the LTE router and create a static default route to the specific LTE router for that trailer.  I threw together a quick design to show that im talking about.
