Windows 7 makes it harder to support multiple heterogeneous cards.  In XP you can load two different drivers but in Vista and 7 you can only load one driver (well, the exception is if you are using the older-style drivers which will have fewer features and more DRM restrictions).  Your best bet is to always use two cards that are officially supported by the same driver.  I'd recommend getting two identical cards if possible.
Well i don't know if you are using QUADRO for a real issue however as you probably know, Quadro/GeForce family are closely related, price apart but Quadro drivers don't work on a GeForce  BUT... there is a work around to enable 3d professional acceleration on GeForces (enabling Quadro drivers and detections) that theorically, could transform them into Quadros : 
AFAIK, the new video driver architecture will not aid your situation. The official stance from Nvidia is no you can't mix cards, and experiences from other users is that your mileage may vary when you try to mix the pro and consumer cards.
