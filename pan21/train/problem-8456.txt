Before you end your relationship with your current provider set the TTL value for example.com to a low value e.g. 500 seconds. Note that this change will tale at least the original TTL to be 'seen' across the internet. Migrate everything to your new provider and ensure that it is up-to-date and working correctly. When you are ready to switch change the DNS entry for example.com to point to the new IP address. This will be 'seen' by most quite quickly as you set the TTL to 500 earlier but there will likely be outliers. On your old server arrange to make it read only or perhaps have it reverse proxy to the new server. 
I have a website that has around 50-70k daily traffic. I am mostly interested in with software and a little bit hardware.
Then after 72 hours, I will remove the old IP. Is this a good solution for migration or would you suggest another method for migration?
I am going to switch my ISP, since I am switching my ISP I will have to change my servers IP. But I want migration to be smooth, since I -unexpectedly- got high traffic.
