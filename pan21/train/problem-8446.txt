Both CCleaner and Windows "Disk Cleanup" have the ability to delete all restore points but the last one. This should free up another few Gigs if you haven't done this already. Also, make sure you're not using too much drive space for system restore points. You can check and modify this in "System settings \ System protection. (recommended is 10-12% of your disk).
Our laptop started warning of low disc, and has been running slow. Used CCleaner, but only recovered 2GB. Windows has spontaneously shutdown and on restart, CHKDSC stalled out at 55%. Ran Malwarebytes and it gets almost completed and windows has to shutdown. And we are back to square one. We have deleted all games and most videos and programs that we don't need, but the 200 gb drive c: has 5 GB free of 88 GB and DATA D: has 20 GB free of 84 GB. I'm not very computer savy, Is there any easy way to fix this? We have not been able to run any optimization or defrag for some time now.
Also, you can use a great little freebee software called "Folder Size" which will show you what folders are taking up the most space on your drive. Be careful when deleting folders and files from the C drive as you can corrupt your system - if you don't know what it is, ask or leave it alone. Here's the link:  http://foldersize.sourceforge.net/
