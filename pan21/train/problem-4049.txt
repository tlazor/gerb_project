Hence my question, how do I make sure the backup DC is decommissioned completely and the remaining primary DC is once again 'stand alone', i.e. all remnants of its relationship to the BDC are removed.
I have seen many guides for removing a DC but it's not clear to me what is actually happening.  Am I to assume the DC being removed in these guides is by necessity speaking about a backup DC?  I assume this since removing the last DC ends the domain, right?
However, as I start this process my current backup 2012 R2 DC has so many problems I want to simply remove it from the domain since it is going to be replaced anyway.
I am in the process of changing servers in the system from Server 2012 R2 to Server 2016.  For the DC's, I presume the best plan is to:
The reason I'm asking this question is that I initially want to get rid of the messed up backup DC so that I can get the primary DC back into good health and ready to replicate to my new 2016 DC.  I am concerned I won't be able to repair the current primary DC if it retains any artifacts of its relationship with the currently messed up backup DC.  I have noticed when I run dcdiag on the current PDC, it hangs up if the BDC is not at least online.  That causes my concern that the primary DC won't be able to be fixed if I don't remove all connections to the messed up BDC.
