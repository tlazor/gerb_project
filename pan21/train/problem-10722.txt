The biggest issue was the fact that I named my surface and desktop the same name so I could not view the other in the network tab. Created a shared folder on the windows 7 machine and the files are showing up on both machines. Dropbox seems to actually have a LAN sharing setting, but I do not have enough storage space on it for that option to work and my internet is too slow to host to my other cloud storage options
I suggest creating a Windows share and dropping the files in there, then connecting to the share server from whichever machine you are transferring to. To do this, open "Computer Management." If you can't find it, search for it using the search bar under recent programs in the menu. Then navigate to "System Tools" and finally "Shares." These are all the share servers on your computer, and you can create a new one from here. Follow the instructions to create the share. 
After the share is created, go to the client machine. On the client machine, open Windows explorer, and go to computer. Under the network tab, right click, and "add network location." Follow the instructions with information from the share you created, and you now have a connection between your two machines to transfer files :)
