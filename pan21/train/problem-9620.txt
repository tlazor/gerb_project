Last night my laptop (samsung nc20 running XP) fell off the table and the screen cracked leaving me unable to see anything. 
The key combination for bringing up the display properties window varies depending on settings, probably easiest to right click on a blank part of the desktop, Up, Enter, ctrl-shift-tab. That will get you to the settings screen, not got an XP with 2 screens to test the rest.
I have arranged for a it to be repaired but want to make a back up of several folders before it gets sent away. I was planning to use my parents LG LCD tv as an external monitor so I can see what I am doing when copying things to but after plugging it in nothing seems to happen (works instantly on another laptop running vista) and hotkeys seem to be of no use at all. 
Does anyone know the series of shortcut keys I will need to do to get XP to use an external monitor?
It might take a couple of seconds for the switch to take effect. The key combination will often work in the pre-boot environment, such as BIOS or a boot menu, as well as after booting the OS.
If the hotkey system works via a standard application installed on windows I've found it will only work after you've logged in.
Even if this is a very old question, I can contribute some timeless advice. Many laptops will have an fn key shortcut that can be used to change the display target. Look for one of the function (F) keys with a monitor symbol, or the text CRT/LCD in blue, and press fn+that key.
