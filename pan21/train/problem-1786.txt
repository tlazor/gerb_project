If you have a small number of users and computers in the branch office, just do as you planned: delete their domain, set up their server as a domain controller for your domain, and re-join all computers to it.
You are correct in assuming that one of the two domains needs to go; you can't create a trust between two domains with the same name.
If you want to avoid re-creating all user profiles, you could perform a domain migration; but again, this is not possible between two domains with the same name.
Removing the second domain and re-purposing its server as a replica domain controller for your main domain is indeed a solution; but this will require re-joining all computers in the branch office to your domain, because even if both domains have the same name, they are definitely not the same thing; the same goes for user accounts, and thus for user profiles.
If you have lots of users, or if you absolutely need to keep their user profiles, then you should first rename one of the domains and then perform a domain migration.
If you choose to go this route, I suggest renaming their domain, which is going to be deleted after the migration; a renamed domain is more prone to issues, thus it's better to do that to the domain you are going to remove than to the one you are going to keep.
Renaming one of the two domains can be a viable choice, but beware: this is usually a pain on almost the same level as a domain migration.
