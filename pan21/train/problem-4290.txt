Your intuition is correct: just because your phone can "see" an AP doesn't mean it has the juice to connect to it.
I'm asking because I'm able to boost the strenght of my WiFi AP in the settings and wonder if I really would gain a wider coverage that I actually can use.
If you just want to know the wifi range of your phone, create an ad-hoc wifi network on your phone (just as you would if you were tethering its data plan). Use a laptop to scan for that network at any distance. Many wifi scanner type apps will give you all the information you need.
Unfortunately, the real-life answer is to just boost the AP power and see if you can connect, and if you can connect some speed-test data to quantify how well you're connected.  
"it depends" on how your hold your phone, the layout of the space you're in, how many walls, what's in the walls, etc.
For example, you may get a useful connection 100m in one direction that has no obstructions line-of-sight, but only 20 meters in another direction because there's a couple of walls between you and the AP. 
When my phone (Nexus 5) "sees" the Wifi-Network, is it always able to use it? What happens if I have a very strong AP which sends for example 300m, can my phone send a signal back (to the AP) or isn't it strong enought?
