Checking your storage drives for errors is also a good idea, especially when your are reusing them. Have in mind that having a OS from another system isn't a really good idea and a fresh install is recommended when you have a new motherboard and a CPU. You are not likely to be able to boot into the OS on the new Motherboard and CPU and if you do you are under quite high risk of having BSODs and other errors. 
I just built my new PC and a few things have not been working. Here's the components and what I did...
I took out one of the PCI-E power cables out of the graphics card and plugged it into a power adapter of 6-pin to 4-pin an plugged the 4-pin into the power supply and voila.
I'm glad you've resolved the issue. Just to be on the safe side I would double-check everything and make sure all the cables are plugged in the proper ports and are plugged all the way firmly. I'd also run a stress test on all parts to see if something got damaged along the way so you know your system is safe.
