There are other scenarios where it makes a difference such as when using bcc and when forwarding email.
The most common scenario where you will see a difference is during delivery of an email with multiple recipients.
As a slightly contrived analogue imagine that you are exchanging letters with some entity. Unknown to that entity you create a photocopy of each of those letters which you put in an envelope addressed to your lawyer.
As an analogue to the above imagine you printed out three copies of a letter with three recipients written on the paper. You would then put those three pieces of paper into three separate envelopes and write just one address on each envelope.
When your mail client is sending the email to your mail server all three addresses will be repeated on both envelope and headers. Next your mail server will look up the MX records for example.com and example.net to continue delivery.
When communicating with the MX for example.net all three receivers will still be in the To header, but there will only be two envelope receivers.
When communicating with the MX for example.com all three receivers will still be in the To header, but there will only be a single envelope receiver.
Your mail server will now establish two separate SMTP connections with each of the receiving servers to send the email further.
