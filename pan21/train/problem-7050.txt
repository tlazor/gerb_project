FreeIPA does SSH key management pretty well. I use it successfully at home but many businesses use it in production (the freeipa-users mailing list is hyper-active). It's the upstream free software project on which is based Red Hat's Identity Management solution. There are also Red Hat devs moderating and helping on the freeipa-users mailinglist.
Basically it's an Active Directory-like service for Unix/Linux environments. It can also sync with AD. It has *nix native features like NFS automounts, centralized sudo policies, etc.
Being a RedHat project, it is a one-liner to install on Fedora or CentOS, but I've successfully installed and configured debian boxes as FreeIPA clients. I install the authentication server on a Fedora Server though, which is its natively supported platform.
Each user can add its SSH key to its FreeIPA profile. Then sshd can be configured to use an AuthorizedKeysCommand provided by the sssd package which would be configured to query the FreeIPA server. Combined with sudo policies, you get privilege escalation and audit (who sudo'ed).
