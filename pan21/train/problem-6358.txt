One of my external USB hard drives apparently was failing. Some weeks ago I found I couldn't access it anymore, so I had to run chkdsk, and about 1/3 of the drive was bad sectors. I believe that Windows may have been hanging because it was running into them while scanning the drive at boot. Since recovering the data off the drive and powering it off, I have not experienced any issues with booting. It has been a couple months now, so I believe this resolved the problem.
As it is happening at such an early stage, I believe the most likely cause is a bad I/O driver, but, it could be anything.
and finally if this doesn't solve it, we have to go the old fashioned way and disconnecting everything you can in case it is some sort of conflict/issue with third party hardware.
Note: chkdsk only checks the file system structure. It does not check the disk itself. Look to see if the manufactirer has a tool to test the disk. Typically they will provide a bootable ISO for this.
Disable ALL overclocking features and next update ALL the drivers you can - never use the versions that come on disk and take a look at the AMD website and your motherboard company.
First; if you're overclocking, you need to step back down a notch once you start having problems. If you are having problems at the default BIOS settings then you have a hardware problem.
Memtest although great, does not always report errors. Try testing by taking out one stick at a time. I've had to do this recently with a machine. It took me 4 months to figure out which stick it was (failure once every 2-4 weeks in my case). Once I replaced the defective chip I have had a solid machine since (about 6 months now...)
