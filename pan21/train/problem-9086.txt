Start your virtual machine.  You can login with username "fedora" and password "fedora" (without the quotes of course).  After login, you can sudo su - if you wish to become root user.
Then assign your generated ISO to your VirtualBox guest's CD drive and un-check it from the boot-order selection (you still need to boot from the F22 image).
I've just downloaded a Fedora 22 Cloud image and ran it on VirtualBox under Windows, everything works pretty well, except that it asks me for a username/password. The problem is that every place I've read so far says the default is "fedora" and no password, but it won't let me login. I've also noticed that a service called cloud-init is responsible for setting up the cloud image, the login credentials, etc, but since this image is not running on a real provider (the server is just a VM running on a server in my room) I don't know what to do. It's the first time I work with Cloud images and I chose it because I just need a lightweight OS to stand on a VM to run very few and simple web apps for myself, and because Fedora no longer provides an installation DVD to choose the minimal installation.
Here's a way to get the Fedora 22 Cloud image to work with cloud-init on VirtualBox (method borrowed heavily from Cloud-Init docs).
