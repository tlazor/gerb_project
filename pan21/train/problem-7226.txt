This probably means I need to replace the drive, but ignoring that, is there a better tool or method? Am I insane to do this without unplugging the machine (it doesn't look like there is anything exposed that would have current)...?
So when a tape gets physically stuck (LTO-3), does anyone have any recommendations for getting it out if you can get to it from the bay?
If the tape is not ejecting all the way then you need to replace the drive and the "stick a screwdriver in the R/W tab and pray" method will work until then. Another method I've used is grabbing the tape with a pair of pliers
Right now, I have been using a screw driver and sticking it into the little area that is for write protection:
Is this happening with all tapes or just a particular one? Can you see what's causing the "stick" (misalignment, motor problem, cartridge issue)?
Otherwise the method you're using now should work, but you will most likely have to look for a replacement as soon as you can.
Sorry, but when we had a similar incident we had to actually open the juke feeder for the tape drive with a screwdriver..removing screws...and remove the cartridge.
