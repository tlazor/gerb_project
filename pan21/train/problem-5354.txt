I have a Powershell script that updates users attributes in Active Directory that runs just fine from the PowerShell ISE.  However when I try to run the script as a scheduled task it cannot access Active Directory to make the changes.
Account I am using is a Domain Administrator so I would not thinh it is a user permission issue.  Is there some reason this script is not able to access AD?
I was finally able to get the script to work.  The script was being run however it failed when it attempted to make a call to the Active Directory.  The solution was to add the Active Directory module to Powershell.  I found the instructions on how to do that here.  I also added set-executionpolicy remotesigned and import-module activedirectory to the top of my scrpt to make sure these were set as well.  Once I made those changes the script worked just fine.
I know the script runs because it send an email when it starts and it sends an email in the catch block of code when it crashes.  It crashes at the attempt to update AD.
