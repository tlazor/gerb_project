You can set a whitelist on certain routers allowing only specified devices to connect to the network, but that doesn't hide your network from other devices, it just prevents them from being joined to it.
The only way to "hide" a wireless network is to disable broadcasting the SSID, the network name. When the SSID is not broadcast, devices connecting to it must be told the name of the network they are to connect to.
So first, no, there is no way to completely hide a network. You're broadcasting, which really means "standing up someplace high and yelling", or something like that. You just can't hide it.
HOWEVER, most devices will still show an "Unnamed wireless network" or "No SSID" label for the wireless network you're broadcasting, and your local friendly IT staff will not have any trouble finding the location of your illicit transmitter and finding you.
Second, your workplace is not about connecting personal devices for personal needs, and if your business wireless isn't good enough for business needs, that's a problem for your business to solve, not you.
