Also, is the database in that backup was read only when the backup was produced, then it will be read only when restore. Just turn off that database option after you done the restore.
Your better option is just scripting out the options that you want in the RESTORE statement.  The following command will create a new database from a backup of another database (.BAK file) by the name specified and the database will be available in MULTI_USER mode upon completion of the restore.  Of course, make sure the name of the new database is different from the names of any other databases on the instance and this will not impact any existing databases.  The logical names for the primary and log files will need to be the same as they were for the database that the backup was made from.  You will want to give the physical files a new name, using the name of the database that will be created as a result of the restore operation.  This example assumes no log files are used.  If there are the RECOVERY option for each file will need to be changed to NORECOVERY beginning with the initial .BAK file and any subsequent log file RESTORE commands, until the last log restore which will use the RECOVERY option to complete the restore.
Here are the screenshots so that you can see the process.  I have attempted to create a new database by just going to Databases > Right-click > Restore and the same options in the screenshot are provided.  I have reviewed the process online but am unable to find anything that will work and not affect my existing database AccessControl.
Don't create it first because then it will have to be deleted by the RESTORE command and a type if safety check in there might not allow the restore unless you specify the REPLACE option.
