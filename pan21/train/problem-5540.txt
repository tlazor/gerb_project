The site http://www.go4it.ro/download/internet/google-chrome-28-11113372/ downloads a 33 MB file - can't check the version though without uninstalling and have not verified whether the site is trustworthy. Re-uploading to http://www.virustotal.com might be a good idea.
For Chromium Linux/Win/Mac: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugazelle/chromium-all-old-stable-versions/master/chromium.stable.json
It has build numbers instead of version numbers. Still, at least this one is an official website, and it can be trusted.
I'm guessing that link will expire. But that link had v50... before, I changed it to 49.... and it worked for me today.
