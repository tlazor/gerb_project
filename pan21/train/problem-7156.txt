If you can live without the separate Linux boot partition, I would suggest moving the Linux boot stuff from its own partition (/dev/sda1) to / (/dev/sda2), formatting sda1 as ntfs (and mark it as being active), and then installing Windows onto /dev/sda6: the Windows installer should be quite happy to do it.
I would like to convert sda6 to a primary partition, the reason for this it to install windows 7 starter.
The best you can do is delete sda4, sda5 and sda6 and create the primary partition in the emptied space.
Windows does not need to be installed onto a primary partition. It does however need to have a primary partition onto which it can put its boot stuff.
You can't. There are already 3 primary partitions plus one extended partition on the disk. In any case, there's no reason why Windows 7 (or any >NT version of Windows) won't/can't install on a logical partition.
I have the following partition setup. I would like to know how can I convert the logical partition sda6 to a primary partition.
(As an example I've just created a Virtual machine, and, on the hard disk made a primary 512MB partition (marked active and formatted as ntfs) and an extended partition containing one logical partition formatted as ntfs. Windows XP installed quite happily on the logical partition.)
With that partition layout you will not be able to change sda6 to a primary partition without first deleting both sda5 and sda4 (the extended partition itself) as you can only have a maximum of 4 primary partitions on a drive.  This is a limitation of how drives are partitioned and is why you end up with extended (logical) partitions in the first place.
