The only useful info I could find via Google was this thread, with the solution being to run a script upon login to recreate the shortcut. There's no way to do that with a batch file and I don't want to bother with much more than that so I thought I'd check if anyone had another solution to this problem.
I'm connecting to a Windows Server 2008 machine via RDP and opt to share the C: drive of my local machine (running Win7.) This always works without issue. When I create a shortcut to something on that drive, say, \\tsclient\C\Jobs, it works fine until I log out. When I log in again, the shortcut does not work. There's no feedback, no 'folder can't be found, do you want to delete this shortcut?', nothing. I'm able to navigate to that directory manually, but the already created shortcut simply does not work anymore, and I'll need to recreate it each time I log in.
I found a solution to this here. Add "%windir%\explorer.exe " without the quotes, with the space, before the directory in the shortcut target.
