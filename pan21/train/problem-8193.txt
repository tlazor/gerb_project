Most likely your clients have a cached version and they dont check if they are modified on your server. So you'd need to fix your cache settings, then you can move them to a different folder. Eg. if you move /styles/*.css to /css/ instead, and all js files from scripts to /js/ their browsers would have to refetch resources.
I recently pushed a major update to a site and I'm having an issue where some people can't log in because their browser is loading old javascript files. Some of the things I have done include:
I believe that having add_header Cache-Control no-cache; set should keep things from being cached, but perhaps you have something that was cached in there before you set that?
You are ignoring the cache of your readers browser.  Unless you change the name of your objects (eg. add a version number to the .js), or the objects were sent with an ETag or Modification-Date, the browser may consider his version of the object is still valid for a couple of decennia, and never consult your server.
Have you tried manually deleting everything that is in your cache?  This is typically /var/cache/nginx.
