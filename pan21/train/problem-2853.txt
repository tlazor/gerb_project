Our staff shares the same email as our customers for better marketing purposes. For example, ceo.bob@product.com or client.su@product.com. The decision has been made to keep this pattern but find a way if possible to redirect certain aliases to a different mail server or service. Adding a @corp.product.com would be easy but is not preferred. 
I was wondering if there's a product that acts as the first line of mail servers @product.com and checks for matching aliases of [employees]@product.com and sends it to a different mail server or service like Office365 and the rest go to our internal product mail server. Outgoing emails should look like they are coming from @product.com for both staff and customers. 
We are a pretty small startup which is involved with providing mail services as part of the portfolio. Up to now, all our C-level officer's emails have been going through our own mail server product and consequently the same store as our customers. The mail server is a custom written solution and is frequently updated but the bigger problem is that our devops team has full access to both the server and the mail store. There is something to be said about dogfooding our own software but at some point a bit more privacy is required as the startup grows.
