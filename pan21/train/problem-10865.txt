Typically the LowerBound does equal the x and y of a rectangle and UpperBound equals the x+width and y+height of the rectangle. As long as the width and height are positive numbers.
The reason for the way the properties are named is because of the way it's used. AABBs are used for bounding, thus the properties describe the bounds, and so are called UpperBound and LowerBound. Yes, they're points. You need two values to define bounds on any given axis. The LowerBound contains the minimum values for the x and y axis, and the UpperBound contains the maximum values for the x and y axis.
The primary difference is how they're used and how they're expected to respond. For example, AABBs do not rotate, rectangles are allowed to. You're right, they're very similar and you could use a rectangle like an AABB if you applied some restrictions to it. AABBs are essentially rectangles that are always positioned to be aligned with the axes of the world. When you can make the assumption that none of your bounds are rotated, this makes many things simpler with algorithms for collision detection.
The reason for naming the two AABBs A and B is just preference. Typically in these scenarios, you just have two objects, where (usually) the order you compare them isn't particularly important. A and B are arbitrary names.
