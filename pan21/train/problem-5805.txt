IPv4 and IPv6 are to different protocols. So a IPv4 only client can only communicate with an IPv4 server. An IPv6 only client can only communicate with an IPv6 Server. Dual-Stacking means that you uses both protocols. Most modern 
There are some ways to "translate" one protocol into another, for HTTP (and some others) you can use a proxy server. For a wider variety of protocols NAT64 / DNS64 works pretty well unless you (or the party you are trying to communicate with) uses IP addresses (e.g. to embedded pictures into a web page) instead of DNS. AFAIK for Cisco the NAT64 part can only be done on ASR1K routers. 
Dual stack means that an interface can communicate with both v4 and v6 clients.  It DOES NOT mean that it will translate between the two.  For that, you need to implement NAT-PT, to translate between the different layer 3 protocols.    BTW, I've never seen NAT-PT work at any scale.
From your question, I gather that you have IPv4 on all systems, but IPv6 is only configured on the routers. To make the network fully dual stack, the hosts should also be configured to run IPv6.
In a dual stack network, a host has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 configuration allowing them to choose which protocol to use. When communicating with an IPv6 host, it will use its IPv6 address, when talking to an IPv4 host, it will use its IPv4 address.
Please forget everything you read about NAT-PT which is deprecated but might still be used for some (Cisco) certification tests. 
To allow an IPv4-only host to an IPv6-only one requires some kind of address translation. There are different so-called "IPv6 transition mechanisms". Most are designed to be able to deploy IPv6-only networks and still allow the machines to talk to IPv4 networks.
