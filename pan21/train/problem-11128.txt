I am running Kubuntu 18.04 with Plasma version 5.12.7, and the keyboard shortcut for terminal is switched off by default.
Made me think there's already a setting somewhere that is switched off, which I eventually found going through System Settings. (click launcher button, start typing system (for System Settings) click the link when it appears) to launch System Settings.
It said "The shortcut 'Ctrl+Alt+T' conflicts with the following combination: Shortcut 'Ctrl+Alt+T' in Application KDE Daemon for action Run Konsole"
PS. I have tried setting up shortcut that would issue xterm command, but that shows raw terminal, that looks a lot differently from the one that can be opened from the menu.
activate 'Example' button (it's greyed out by default - see the comments tab once 'Example' is selected)
The one from the menu is called "Konsole" so use whatever keybinding you have for the quick launcher and then type Konsole and it will come up as a choice and you are good to go.
I didn't use KDE menu editor solution as I got a conflict warning message when I tried to edit the 'Current shortcut key'.
Here's how I assigned in.. right-click the Kickoff Application launcher icon -> Edit Applications -> System -> Konsole -> Advanced Tab -> Current Shortcut Key
