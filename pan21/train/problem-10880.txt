In the following example I used nslookup to query the root servers for my domain (joewebster.com) and then used that answer to query the "next level", and then finally used the authoritative servers for joewebster.com to actually get the answer for the query: joewebster.com
As you can see, the root server that I queried (first level - a.root-servers.net) only knows which servers are authoritative for the .com gTLD. If it knew which servers were authoritative for my domain it would have returned those servers in it's answer. As it stands, I then had to query one of the gTLD servers for the .com gTLD (second level - c.gtld-servers.net), which in turn answered with the name servers for my domain which are ns1.mydyndns.org and ns2.mydyndns.org. Finally, I queried one of those servers (third level - ns1.mydnydns.org), which provided an answer since it is authoritative for my domain.
Because the root name servers (the servers responsible for the . root domain) don't maintain information about any third level domains. They maintain information about the gTLD's and ccTLD's.
The relevant gTLD or ccTLD in turn maintains information for third level domains that fall under that gTLD or ccTLD (.com or .us for instance).
