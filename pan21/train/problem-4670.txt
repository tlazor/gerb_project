Watch it though (this is where the semantics comes in), because DHCP reservations are sometimes referred to in ways that use the word static, such as "Static Allocation":
The reason they do this is because it gives the ISP the advantage of providing you with an unchanging "static" or "dedicated" IP address but without having to do (or explain) anything different in regards to your end's hardware configuration, then they would for anyone using a dynamic IP.
A 'dedicated IP' from the ISP (in this case at least) is going to be a DHCP reservation set on the ISP's side assigned to your router's MAC address. You're router requests an IP via DHCP, but instead of the ISP giving you whatever the next available address is (ie: a 'Dynamic IP'), it sees you have a reservation for a certain IP, so it always gives you (and only you) that address, since it's been reserved for you.
Aside from initial setup, it's also useful if you decide later that you don't want to pay for the dedicated IP anymore, or you'd like a different dedicated IP then can just remove or change the reservation on their end, and no changes will need to be done to your end.
There is/can be a semantic difference between a "Dedicated IP" and a "Static IP", and I think that's partly what's throwing you off here.
