The problem is my endpoints are not getting all the updates. They receive some and then stop. I would say that 50% of the patches have been applied. I try to do the Software update scan and still they do not see the updates when I know they are in the Software Update group and have been downloaded. Should I break these update groups down smaller into groups by date. Currently, I have an update group called All Office 2010 Updates. This was made by doing a search and filtering by product=office2010, superseded =no, and expired =no.
I've implemented SCCM 2012 in my environment and have been trying to get all endpoints caught up on their updates. The previous management for some odd reason thought patching computers was not high priority. I'm wondering how some of you SCCM experts would approach this situation: You have just set-up SCCM 2012 and your endpoints may not have been patched in over year! I've created Software Update groups for each piece of software that shows needs updates when I check online such as Visual Studio 2008, Office 2010, Windows patches, etc. I have deployed the Software Update groups to a test collection consisting of all healthy clients.
Should I break the updates out into groups by date, by every quarter since the product was released? I'm not finding any clear information on this topic. I have been using the SCCM 2012 unleashed book.
