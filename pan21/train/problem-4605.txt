I waited 2 days to see my test clients report in, I used 4 Servers and 4 desktops.  Only two have reported in, 1 server and 1 desktop.  I manually created the "Servers" group and "Desktops" group on WSUS but the server reported to "Unassigned Computers" and the desktop reported to "All Computers".  None of the others checked in.  When I looked at the %windir%\WindowsUpdate.log on each machine it appeared that registry settings were being ignored.
On the desktop (Windows 10) I ran Get-WindowsUpdateLog in Powershell and checked the generated file. these lines stood out:
Once again, Instead of Target Group being "Desktops" like in the registry it says Unassigned Computers. In this case it does not appear in Unassigned Computers on the WSUS server though it is in All Computers group.
In this case the server is ignoring the port at the end of the ip address.  When I originally set up WSUS I set the server url in the registry without the port because I didn't realize the newer version didn't use port 80 anymore.  I changed the registry to include the port but it doesn't seem to have taken the setting.
I installed WSUS on Server 2012 R2.  Installation went well on the server side.  I do not have an Active Directory environment so I have to use registry settings on the clients.  I used the following registry settings:
On one of the desktops (Windows 7) that didn't report in, the logs show the system validating signatures but then i see this:
The answer turned out to be extremely basic and embarrassing.  The WSUS setting do not require a computer reboot on the first time they are set however if they are ever changed apparently the computer must be rebooted.  I did not try this initially since the registry settings took effect immediately when I set up the server the first time without the proper port.  Once I rebooted the logs reflected the updated registry settings.
I run regedit and confirm that the settings are in the registry.  After adding the registry settings I ran:
