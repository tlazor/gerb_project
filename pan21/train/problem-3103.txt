And it's also available in Sid, so it looks like you might have some APT misconfiguration problem or the package for that plugin Fancy was renamed etc.
But the Debian repositories do not contain either the Dillo plugin or the  Gtkhtml2 plugin.  The stable code tarball for version 3.15.1 does not contain them either, so I can't compile them.  The git tree includes the dillo plugin, but I'm reluctant to use that as I'll have to compile the entire client from what appears to be a development snapshot.  
Is there now no stable HTML viewer for Claws Mail?  I am really hoping that this isn't true, because then I'll have to switch clients (the non-HTML display method just doesn't cut it when most emails are now in HTML), and I don't want to do that.
I use Claws on Debian, and recently the Fancy plugin stopped working because of what looked like a filesystem issue.  I uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it, only to discover that the Debian repositories no longer contain any installable candidate for 32-bit x86 systems.  I gather there have been security concerns with this plugin. 
I have been using Claws Mail as my email client for almost a decade.  It's fast, configurable and friendly.
The fancy plugin has been removed because it depends on libwebkitgtk-1.0-0, which has been removed from Debian 9: https://bugs.debian.org/790199
However, it does not natively display HTML mail.  For that you need a plugin, and three were earlier available - the Gtkhtml2 plugin, the Fancy plugin and the Dillo plugin.
