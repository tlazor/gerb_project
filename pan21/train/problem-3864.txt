The principle is that you write your configurations modularly in a domain-specific language. These modules can then be layered up in order to bring a host to a required complete or partial state and keep it there. They also form your documentation, since the DSL should be easy to read and re-use. When combined with Revision Control you have more granular control of changes. Most implementations include logging methods which can be expanded upon.
The only thing generally missing from your requirements is the ability to truly capture state and facilitate undo actions. CM can simplify this to some respect, by documenting changes and storing replaced files, but I'm not aware of any systems that will provide a snapshot-like rollback. You might be able to achieve that with virtualisation and backups though.
I'm looking for method or methods and automation tools to log the adjustments I make to a Linux machine.
Rather than approaching it that way, why not simply make all your changes to your servers via a configuration management system like Puppet?  That's how I manage my machines and this way I can be sure that all my machines in a load balanced cluster are identical.
