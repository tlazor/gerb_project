it should print a list of switches.  On windows 10 its showing me -l (lower case L) is for size and -f for "don't fragment"
It sounds like either something is interrupting the connection on BSNL.  Another possibility would be TCP Windowing and packet sizes.
A good test would be regardless of connection, try to ping google's DNS server with "ping -f -l 1300 8.8.8.8"
You can test the size difference with PING in a command line and also with the "don't fragment" flag set
You would manually set the MTU for that VPN connector/connection. It would probably effect both (since its the same cisco client) so you'd have to go with the lower value that allows both to work.
you'll probably have to play with the commands a little or re-google with your specific windows version.
FYI, TPLink has a good page demonstrating the above, and also notes that this is a common problem with VPN connections.
with your remote server host name or ip after the 1420.  If both fail, back it off to 1380 .. if both pass, increase by 5 .. like 1425 ... 1430 etc.. until you start getting a failure.
At home on comcast ... I'm getting 1272 with "dont fragment" as a working value, and 1273 I get "packet needs to be fragmented but DF set"
