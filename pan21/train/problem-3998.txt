I couldn´t find it in "/var/webmin", in "/etc/iptable*", "/etc/sysconfig/iptables", or in "iptables.up.rules".
I want to copy the firewall configuration for iptables from one server to the other. Both servers run Debian Squeeze and have Webmin 1.660 installed, so I want to copy the configuration that Webmin uses.
But! You can change the Webmin Module Config (see the link on top of the webmin "Linux Firewall" page). On this configuration page, there's a line "IPtables save file to edit". Change this from "Use operating system or Webmin default" to the second value where you can provide a path+filename (e.g. "/etc/webmin/firewall/iptables.save").
"/var/lib/iptables/active" is the current configuration and when I edit it, those changes won´t show up in Webmin. Though, when I click on "Revert Configuration" my changes are lost in that file and replaced.
Like @Satanicpuppy says in a comment:  It doesn't really "store" anything outside the actual config file.
Hmm, seems I must have done something wrong before, because you can simply replace "/var/lib/iptables/active" with the content or file you need and in Webmin click on the "Showing IPtable" button to have Webmin reload and display the new rules.
