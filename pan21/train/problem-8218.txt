I suspect it will come down to speed for you, in which case you should run some tests with a bunch of DNS lookups against several different options you're looking into to determine what seems fastest from your location.
That said, ISP DNS servers could also have these downsides.  The only way around them is to run your own separate DNS server(s), which will be more servers to support, or just leave your AD DNS servers with no forwarders and have them use the root hints.  The latter will almost certainly not perform as well, so it's probably not your best option.
The other concern is having your search queries logged or otherwise seen externally, which is up to the business to determine if this is an issue or not.
Since you did clarify that you mean using public DNS as the forwarders, and I assume you currently use your ISPs for this, then there are only 2 downsides I can see.  
First, as was mentioned, you may not receive NXDOMAIN records properly for non-existant domains, and instead be directly to helper sites.  I don't believe Google does this, and I know OpenDNS does this, but has an option to turn it off, but it's worth a test for whoever you're looking into.
