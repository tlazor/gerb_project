Did a quick google search and it looks like the default key for BIOS access if F2, not F12. If you tried that one, like Frank said, you're probably just not hitting it in time. Try spamming the bios key while turning the machine on if you're still having trouble.
Except in my case I didn't even have to remove the battery 4 bios reset. Once I turned it off for a minute, the bios allowed me to push the F2 key again for reentry.
This has nothing to do with windows 7 or ubuntu or multi-boot or grub. You're simply not managing to get into the BIOS. In your case, when you don't manage to get into the BIOS, the next thing is grub but that is not very relevant. If you took the hard drives out completely and tried to get into the BIOS then Grub wouldn't come up. All that nonsense about windows 7 and ubuntu and grub and multiboot is all irrelevant. And you didn't even mention trying keys other than F12 like F2 or DEL.
One of my friend had the same issue.At last the issue turned out to be with the keyboard of his laptop. If you are using PC, try connecting another keyboard. If using laptop, take it to the service center.
