If rEFInd doesn't help or if you want to boot your new installation in EFI mode, another option is to re-install Windows. You'll need to figure out how to force the firmware to boot the installer in EFI mode, though. You'll also need to wipe the partition table on the target disk -- not just delete the partitions, but remove the entire partition table, since Windows ties that to its boot mode.
If you're dual-booting with another EFI-mode OS, it's conceivable that my rEFInd boot manager can help, since it's an EFI-mode boot manager that can launch either EFI-mode or BIOS-mode boot loaders. Unfortunately, rEFInd's BIOS-mode loading options are rather limited, so I can't guarantee it will work for you, particularly on a two-disk setup. It might be worth trying, though. If it will work at all, it requires you to uncomment the scanfor line in refind.conf and add hdbios to the list of options.
Chances are you accidentally installed Windows in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode. It is possible to convert from a BIOS-mode to an EFI-mode installation, but the procedure is a bit tedious. (See here for details.) If your new Windows installation is your only OS, your best bet is probably to switch your firmware defaults to boot in BIOS mode. (It may be called "legacy mode," "CSM," or something else; firmware user interfaces on this point are woefully inconsistent.)
