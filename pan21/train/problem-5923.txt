I'd create a Task style module that bundles all your dependency listings into a CPAN style module.  That way you can use standard cpan tools to manage it.  For example, here's a bundle I often use (shameless plug)
I have found CPAN less than ideal for long running systems as updating modules over time seems to be less than ideal. 
If you need to do a from-source install of these modules (as I often need to, since I install them as a non-root user in a location other than the system standard) I recommend CPANPLUS as a worthwhile upgrade to standard CPAN - it handles dependency resolution and can automatically install all a module's dependencies while you get a coffee.
Before using CPAN check if some/most/all of the needed packages are not already available for your distro.
I would recommend using your system's built in package management system instead. By using a distribution specific repository you should have fewer issues with dependencies, and as modules get updated you will receive the new versions as well. Since you appear to be using Ubuntu, you may need to enable some of the extra repositories such as world, or metaverse, or uber-ultra-intraverse.
Failing this, there is a relatively new website called Linux Packages Search that attempts to compile packages for all manner of systems. I have had good luck with finding any extra packages that I needed on it, if it wasn't available anywhere else.
Also, if this big complicated application you're installing is also distributed on the CPAN (I'm going to make an outside guess that it's RT, everybody's favourite perl dependency nightmare), there's often a Bundle::AppName package on the CPAN as well which rolls up everything needed for a given version of the app.
Additionally consider using local::lib rather than the global perl include path.  That way you get better management of your deps, and you don't need root.  Here's a link to a good, free book that covers this (amongst other things)
