You can always load bluetooth spftware from broadcom. It will detect bluetooth adapter you have and install most recent HCL driver and suppoerting software. In case of BT controller included with keyboard - it is most likely limited in hardware to one single session to make you buy more expensive general-purpose controller.
It's not very clear what happened.  It sounds like you somehow damaged your bluetooth dongle, but it would surprise me if a bluetooth dongle could be damaged by unplugging it or that you could "reformat" it (unless it has both a flash drive and a bluetooth radio).  I think it is more likely something in your PC that is wrong.  If you had special drivers for your dongle, try to reinstall them.
To inform everyone I did finally get it fixed what happened was I turned off the radio using the windows drivers on a different computer then the one I had the issues with forgetting I did that because some time had passed since I did that I slipped my mind not to mention I didn't think it would literally keep it off even when plugged in to a new computer, Luckily I still had access to the computer with no changes made to the drivers etc and I reinitialized the dongle and away I went. thanks all for the assistance though I am glad I figured this out I didn't want to get another bt dongle
