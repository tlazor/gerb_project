`date`  (in fact, I had a bear of a time even writing the latter in SE MD syntax...) but this is unrelated to the ENV or any script...
I tend to prefix oft-used files and folders with the "accent grave" character (non-shift tilde, the back-tick, or plain-old accent, whathaveyou..), as it is easy to get at, and let's me sort things alphabetically, while letting me choose to show a few items on the top.  It works nicely, except when I go to access these files via the CLI or SSH/SCP.
If I try to run a command, calling the file unescaped ↝ it kicks me into an interactive session..  for example ↯
Note:  This is a Mac OS X environment, but that said, the GUI has never had a problem dealing with this character on a day-to-day basis, and usually, if there's going to be a syntax problem in the Terminal, Apple does a pretty good job of disabling the behavior in the GUI...  Not sure if this is a bug, or if the technique for dealing with such paths is simply obscure.. but so far, I have been un-able to find a way "to escape it"?
