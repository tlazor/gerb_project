I have tried deleting all Apple programs (in the order suggested in the support forum) and also tried to delete the temp folder. That did not work. 
 The codec pack installs some quicktime codecs that stopped the installer. I hope this helps someone out.
I had the same problem, it would not install. Quicktime uninstall would crash. I deleted everything Apple and Quicktime from my pc from folders to registry entries and I got it to install, but it would not launch, would crash. I had a thought... I uninstalled Ace Mega Codec pack and my problems went away. Apparently it was interferring with install and launch.
Maybe you can use QTLite to replace QuickTime. The current version is a bit old (released in December), but it uses a much simpler installer.
The first idea that came to my mind was to make sure that you have the x64 installer and not the x86 or even x86-64 installer.
I am trying to install quicktime (actually just need iTunes..but then iTunes needs qt), but it fails. There seems to be a problem with the folder C:\Program Files(x86)\QuickTime\ - Quick Time wants to write the file QTTask.exe, but complains that it does not have permission to do so. Same thing happens with \PropertyPanels\PanelHelperBase.qpa
I have run the installation file with admin rights and with different compatibility modes to no effect.
This is very annoying as I cannot sync iPhone/iPad/iPod while iTunes is not running - due to the stupid (sorry) idea of only have your device linked to one library.
I consider myself to be an experienced user - able to solve most problems - but now I am stuck. I need some input / fresh ideas on how to tackle the problem.
