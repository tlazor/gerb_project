PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'ext\php_curl.dll' - The specified procedure could not be found.\r\n in Unknown on line 0
When PHP is run through Apache, its bin directory probably takes precedence over system %PATH% variable and therefore PHP's curl extension uses libraries from Apache, resulting in version mismatch (Apache's libraries seem to be older than required).
I am unsure of what dependencies that php_curl could have, if you could provide any suggestions then this would be greatly appreciated.
However I have checked my PATH variable and the PHP directory is listed, the ext folder is set correctly and php_curl.dll exists in the folder.
I had the same problem, but it only manifested when running PHP through Apache. In CLI it was fine - cURL was shown in phpinfo().
After doing the dll copying above, make sure you have the below lines in your php.ini, and that the perm file is there. Don't forget to put your paths.
During my checking I have found that all of the following ddl's are present when opening them from run (to test they can be found from the PATH variable):
