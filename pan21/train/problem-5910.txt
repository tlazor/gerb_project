I want to know which is less used or which DB has less no of transactions or less active through out the day
Unless you have Systems Centre Operations Manager with the SQL Server Management Pack, a good way is to set up some sort of data collector that queries the appropriate DMV's.
Another good way is by the disk IO but this can be misleading too as a lot can show up and be caused by backups/maintenance.
Then run it again at the end of the day. Subtract one set of values from the other. That will give you the most transactions.
Assuming you are running SQL Server 2008 + you can set up a Management Data Warehouse on the instance using SQL Server Management Studio. The result is a graphical user interface in the style of a performance dashboard.
You can look for a similar counter for logins/sec but it may be misleading depending on how the app connects to the database and if it keeps the connection open or not.
Set up out of the box is easy and informative, and when you get bored of the default measures, it can be easily extended.
