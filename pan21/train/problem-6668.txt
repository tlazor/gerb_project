We have a decent-sized server estate: several ProLiants, plus IBM BladeCentre and SANs running a VMWare environment.  Due to an imminent premises move, we're not going to have enough space for a server room, so I've been looking at moving everything out to a colo.  My boss is more keen on the idea of cloud-hosting everything, which would include a couple of high-traffic websites (about 9m pageviews/month), our Exchange sever (about a million clean emails sent/received monthly), as well as file/print/AD/all the ususal stuff.  This doesn;t sound like a good idea to me, but I'm new to the ways of the cloud.  Can anyone offer any advice?
The main advantage of cloud for web hosting is the scalability, and not having to worry about having to drive out to the colo to replace faulty hw. Just remove a node, put up a new one, and add it into your load balancer.
But my point is, dont think one solution fits every problem. Hybrid combined solutions are where you get the most.
we are moving most of our "less used" data into the cloud for backup and sustainability/failover purpose. Our primarydata or mission-critical data is hosted locally and even some of it is automatically synced with cloudbased storage, so that we can have a total hardware failure and still be able to run on cloud data with some latency.
you may want to look into a hybrid solution. Hosting the large websites on the cloud could work, as you can scale up and down depending on traffic. 
My personal choice for a Cloud-host environment at the moment is Amazon AWS, but Microsoft's Azure might be worth paying attention to - Amazon is still in the lead for the time being though. Google Apps Engine is also interesting, but something I wouldn't put production critical data on yet.
