I assembled the system, powered it, installed Windows 7, restarted several times and everything was OK. Then, I decided to install a PCI WiFi card. After the installation the system did not produce any video output and no system beeps, but the fans were on and the power diode on the motherboard was lit in green.
On the motherboard there is a red diode that is said to be the "DRAM LED", which was constantly lit (something which did not happen before). I tried the procedure described in the booklet - holding the MemOK button until the red diode started flashing - but the system would just sit there blinking and nothing was happening. I then followed all of the advices in this forum post, but the same thing was happening. I then replaced both the PSU and the video card, repeating the same procedures as above, but the system still doesn't boot.
Since there are two RAM modules, I tried almost all combinations of these on the different slots and also tried with only one RAM module at a time, but the system wouldn't boot. Since I have eliminated all the other components (either by replacing them or removing them), the only thing left that could be causing the problem is the motherboard (also something that people on the internet say).
