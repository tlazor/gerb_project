This question is very vague it's hard to even begin to guess, but my initial reaction is your hard drive is flaking out. Try replacing it to see if that improves performance, or running some form of hard drive maintenance software (e.g. Spinrite).
Probably crap software. A perfect example of this is some Brother printer stuff I put on my iMac. Recently I noticed that a process "NETServe" (accessing a lot of Brother files) was using 60-70% of my CPU.
I agree with everyone else here that the question is quite vague, but I'm not sure the hardware may be the way to go.  What sort of maintenance has been run on the computer?  Have you run Disk Cleanup (Start --> Programs --> Accessories --> System Tools --> Disk Cleanup)?  Are antivirus, system updates, and firewall updates fully applied?  If not, malware or spyware can be slowing you down, and MalwareBytes or a similar application can help (search for spyware cleanup here to get some great guides).  Is there a lot of small files on your system?  Contrary to popular belief, defragmenting the hard drive CAN (at least) marginally improve speed as more fragmentation requires more time to read and access files, or lots of small files spread accross the drive mean more time required to access them all.  If these have been run, and the computer is still slow, have you done a search on google for improving windows xp performance?  There's a lot of good guides available to get more speed out of the system.
Check your running processes, and worst case backup anything important and lay a clean install of Windows down. I know people that do this like clockwork simply because of the crap the gets built up.
