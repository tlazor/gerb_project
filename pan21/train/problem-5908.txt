I'd say the biggest reason to upgrade to 11.04 is to keep you on track for the next LTS release (which should be 12.04). You cannot upgrade directly from 10.10 to 12.04, however once you do get onto an LTS release you can stay there until the next LTS, and then upgrade direct to that one if you want. So if your goal is stability and consistency, I'd say stay on top of the most current releases until you can get yourself into that LTS cycle.
I'm wondering what the benefits of upgrading to 11.04 for my ubuntu VPS. I'd stay with the last LTS release (10.04), except that my host doesn't have a template for it (I could ask, but I don't plan to wait for support. the company's support kind of sucks).
As long as you're not bound to specific/default package versions of your current install (Apache/Python/Perl/PHP/MySQL/PgSQL..), I'd recommend - upgrade.
FWIW, I just upgraded one of my servers from 10.10 to 11.04. A tad tedious going through all the "conflicted" config files -- especially since most of the "conflicts" were simply new/removed comments -- but it was hardly painful and I had no problems. I'll be updating another server to 11.04 over the weekend, and then I've got a third, neglected server I need to somehow get off of 9.04...
While I've never had any problems with any Ubuntu (and I typically run the most current version), I do recommend the LTS versions for business-critical servers, mostly because of the consistency -- you have at least 2 years, give-or-take, before you need to consider an upgrade, versus 6 months to 1 year (well, really, you can push that out to 18 months without losing security updates, but then that gets painful because you have to upgrade multiple times in sequence to get up-to-date) with the non-LTS releases.
