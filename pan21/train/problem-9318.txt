Agree with the alcohol cleaning tip. I opened the volume control housing and then used an alcohol pad I got from the pharmacy (very cheap); stuck it in under the volume control from different sides and turned the knob back and forth. Tried to wipe everything clean. Even without being able to properly get the pad into the insides of the volume control, it made a significant improvement.
As I write this, I've cleaned it up with Petrol drops. PCB is drying. I chose Petrol because Contact Cleaner is expensive solution. Am I correct or any other method could be used?
The contacts within the volume control are apparently slightly oxidized, causing the intermittent behavior you are reporting. A one time purchase of contact cleaner will last a lifetime (or until you lend it to someone) and is the best way to fix these common problems. Since oil is a non-conductive substance, using petrol drops may make the problem worse.
Due to dust or so, the Volume Control Wheel does not work properly. Volume goes to one speaker, and other gets muted. Vice versa. When I carefully turn the wheel sometimes the Volume works properly or sometimes with noise or muted one side.
