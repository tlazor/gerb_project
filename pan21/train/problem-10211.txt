What will the speed will each user get ? Will the 4MB be divided among all 75 users or will all users receive the same speed throughout the day ?
Com on, that is common sense. NATURALLY the limited resource (4Mbit bandwidth) will be distributed among the users that actually use it (which is less than 50-75 - not everyone will have the same demands at exactly the same moment).
Normally you would put a router on each end, shape the output interface of the router (which probably is ethernet) to 4Mbps, configure a QoS policy and apply fair-queueing, random-detect. You could also prioritize or reserve bandwidth for some applications.
This would be entirely dependent on what everyone was doing at any given moment. The minimum bandwidth everyone could get would be 1/75th of the 4Mb (everyone streaming videos for example). The maximum could be 4Mb, with only one person using the line.
Say that i purchase a 4 Mb leased line (Radio wave), and also i have around 50-75 users using the connection.
Well, actually it depends on the queue management on each end. If it is a FIFO queue, in case you have eg a big FTP transfer between the two sites, it will consume the whole bandwidth while connections to Internet will suffer and telnet will seem unresponsive.
