I've decided to RMA the board (not as a DOA, but trading it for another brand). I have searched a bit more and it appears some Z77 bios, in particular Gigabyte, contain a lot of bugs. Fixes are released every month or so, but progress is slowly and it's unlikely the next release will fix everything or without introducing new bugs. 
My solution was to break pin 20 in the cable connector (it's the bottom right pin looking in to the cable, with the 'U'-shaped grooves pointing downwards).  A branded cable would also work.  Maybe Gigabyte will also eventually update their BIOS to handle this (as of F14 it is not working), though it could also be a hardware problem that can never be fixed in BIOS.  Also the engineers may never reproduce the issue in the lab if they are using 'proper' cables...
I had exactly the same problem and figured out it is was the cable not the motherboard!  The spec for Displayport cables directs that pin 20 (power) should not be connected.  However, many (cheaper) cables don't adhere to this.  Some devices (esp Dell monitors and Gigabyte motherboards) fail completely in this situation - I assume other devices are somehow better configured to handle unexpected power being received, though it's hard to blame Gigabyte.
So for people experiencing similar issues, try updating your BIOS. By the time you read this, it may well be fixed. I'm not going to wait on this, if I can't normally boot my PC or enter my BIOS without unplugging devices, it's ridiculous. 
I'm going back to Asus, I have experience on 2 other systems that work just fine. Too bad, this Gigabyte board has a very complete feature set. The Asus equivalent sets me back another 30euro's($), but oh well.
