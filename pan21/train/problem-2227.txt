This may require a couple of more steps to position your picture properly but it seems to be simpler than changing the DPI and saving the image.
After five years of having this issue, I can gladly say I have finally figured out which key was causing the problem, greatly reducing my blood pressure.
What about using Insert File and attaching it that way.  It won't put it in the actual message, and outlook won't try to resize it.
Don't mean to be a necromancer on this question but none of the above solutions solved this issue for me.  The only way I was able to solve the issue was by deleting the following key:
The default wrapping mode can be set in tools, options, mail format, editor options, advanced, insert/paste picture as.
After inserting the picture set the text wrapping mode to In Front of Text instead of Inline with Text.
If you do need it in the bottom, you can right-click the picture and go to Format Picture.  From there go to the Crop tab, and you can adjust the size of the picture there.
