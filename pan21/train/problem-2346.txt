I had this problem.  I found if I unplugged the wired network from the router then all the wireless devices connected fine.  If I plugged in the wired network then some wireless devices worked and other didn't.  I diagnosed it by unplugging everything on the lan and re-connecting them one at a time, until I found that I had put the network in the wrong socket on my FON wireless access point.  I plugged it in where it said "internet" not where it said "computer", and all was well.
Sometimes our internet will "act up", meaning some of the wireless devices will register as being connected to the access point but unable to access any sites. In such a case the other devices seem to be access the internet just fine.
We have a wifi router set up at home connected to our DSL router. And a lot of computers using it...there's a desktop (connected to the router via a wired connection), 6 laptops, an ipad and a few internet-capable cellphones (yeah, there are a lot of us at home)
I'm wondering if there's some sort of limit or anything to the number of wireless devices we should be allowing to access the router that causes this problem? What things do I need to check?
