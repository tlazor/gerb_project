I need to add a last_modified column to a MyISAM table tbl_items. The crux of this problem is that tbl_items houses several gigabytes of data. Also of note, I am using a master-slave deployment with one slave. 
 * There is a brief outage when it makes the final switchover.  This is probably brief enough to be acceptable.
One way that might work is as follows.  It requires that you already have "dual-master, single-writer" set up.
Another possibility...  Facebook has a posting on how to do an online ALTER.  It does have drawbacks...
Obviously, running the necessary ALTER TABLE command on the master is unacceptable since it locks the table for well over a half-hour. I cannot afford this kind of downtime at ANY time of day or night, most unfortunately. 
Is this a viable solution? It would seem to me that all new tbl_items inserts would be lost between the beginning of step 2 and step 4; that is, is it possible for tbl_items data to replicate throughout the interval that it's missing the new column?
If that's the case, is there an alternate solution that eliminates the possibility of both downtime and data-loss? 
While the nonunique indexes are disabled, they are ignored for statements such as SELECT and EXPLAIN that otherwise would use them.
