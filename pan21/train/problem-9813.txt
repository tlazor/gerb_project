Are you sending emails from web form? If yes, you might not be using SMTP authentication which is causing hostname and IP to be taken from the local mail server from you sent the email. You should use one your email account for SMTP authentication. The following are the settings you need to use in your script.
The important thing to note is that your MX records ARE properly configured for G Suite. MX Toolbox is a great site to verify this on https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=mx%3amullanlighting.com&run=toolpage.
A client's email is handled by G Suite. When I check senderscore.org a strange sending IP and hostname (mail.jbsgroup.ie) appears amongst other Google-related hostnames. This particular domain belongs to another organisation in the locality. Can someone explain to me why is it appearing here and should I be worried?
If you do not recognize or trust the mail.jbsgroup.ie hostname that appears to be sending mail on your client's behalf, then you can use SPF records to add a great layer of protection. SPF records will allow you to specify which servers are allowed to send mail from mullanlighting.com, and can also tell email recipients' servers to ignore all messages that are sent from anywhere else. For example, you might configure SPF records to identify Google's mail servers as the only authorized servers for your email domain.
