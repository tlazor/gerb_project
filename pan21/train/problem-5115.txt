Option 1 is cheap solution. But how great the transfer speeds will be? Will i get around 20-30 MBPS . 
Now, I wish I could have fast file transfers between the PC and laptop. My desktop has obsolete hardware which limits the file transfer speed. 
Option 2 is good if i ditch WiFi . But in case if i use WiFi between laptop and router ( and of course LAN between router and switch) I will be limited to 100Mbps I guess. Isn't it? 
I also have my brother's laptop which contains Atheros AR5B93 WiFi module which has a/b/g/n specs (n could be draft2) . The laptop has Gigabit Ethernet.
Then I have an ADSL (modem+router) which has WiFi a/b/g/n support. The wireless speed is labelled as 150Mbps and it is not having any antenna. And it has 100Mbps Ethernet ports.
I have checked the WiFi link speed between laptop and router is 300Mbps , even though my router is labelled 150Mbps. And i have checked file transfers between PC and laptop (with PC connected to router via LAN @100Mbps and laptop connected to routers WiFi access point @300Mbps) and the transfer speed remains at 10-12MBPS. I think the 100Mbps LAN is the bottleneck here.
I currently have an obsolete WiFi G USB card on my desktop PC. And my desktop only has 100 Mbps Ethernet.
