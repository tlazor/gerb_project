Also, just copy-pasting configuration files from one system to another is one of the worst things you can do. Avoid this at all costs.
EDIT: I re-installed xp but can't find drivers for the machine, so I grabbed it's config files (like boot.ini) and re-imaged back to before the install. I copied over the files and now I get the boot options screen that seems to try to boot, but now it can't find hal.dll...
If you don't want to mess with the drivers you must install the windows version that originally came with the system and download them right from the manufacturer's website. Alternatively, you can connect to the internet and make the Device Manager to automatically install the drivers for your devices, but this doesn't work always.
I have an XP machine that is still used by family and it is not booting anymore. It stops at a black screen with a blinking underline. When I booted to a xp disk and got to the repair console, I did a fixboot and fixmbr and then it would boot to a choose your os screen, only listing the recovery console. I tried bootcfg /rebuild but it gives me an error saying the file system may be corrupt. chkdsk /f /r shows no errors. I booted to hirens and replaced the contents of the boot.ini file with ones i found online that are the defaults, but it sill just sits at the black screen with the curser.
Spinrite shows the drive is otherwise fine. The issue may be the file system i guess, it just seems that at this point, there is no re-install option.
