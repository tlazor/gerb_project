Get a soft movable wrist rest for your mouse, movable so that you can place it under your elbow if you start feeling pain there.
Keep your monitor at the right height so you're sitting somewhat straight when you're in your chair.
Get up and move away from your desk on a regular basis.  Exercise is important, but taking physical breaks are also important.
If you don't have an adjustable and comfortable chair, buy one yourself if your company refuses to provide one for you, though I would probably leave a company like that.
Get the most comfortable and adjustable chair you can find/afford. Having a rested back/legs will go a long way towards keeping you focused. Pain/discomfort = distraction.
Also, if you have glasses, there are certain coatings for the glass (like anti-reflective) that makes working with a computer all day easier.
If you have a second screen, don't keep it on the same side all the time, or put it above your normal screen or you will eventually develop neckpains due to always looking to the side in the same direction.
If you get into a situation that hurts, tell your boss.  In many juristictions you can make it a workman's-compensation or job health-and-safety issue if it is a real problem.
