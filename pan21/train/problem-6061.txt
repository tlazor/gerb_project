If you control a DNS record, one aspect of that record is the "TTL" which tells DNS servers (and properly behaving clients) how long it should cache that value after it gets it from the authoritative DNS server.
One is the time it takes for your domain registrar to place the DNS entries you've provided through some sort of web form / management panel on the registrars DNS servers. This 'update' process usually occurs within 15 minutes.
Yes.  Your ISP is almost certainly caching DNS settings for some period of time. They are supposed to refresh the records when the TTL expires. Unfortunately there are a large number of ISPs that seem to ignore TTLs all together in their DNS caching schemes.  If you happen to be on one of those ISPs it could be hours or even days before they respect the new records, even if you have a very low TTL set.
Also, if you're expecting to change your DNS records often, and you want those updates to take effect quickly, you should reduce the TTL of your records.  You'll see more load on your DNS server, but at the same time, your DNS chages will be seen faster.
Two there is the TTL field of each RR (Registry Record), which basically says: if someone asked about domain.com before, cache the domain.com -> IP address RR for TTL seconds (cache so I don't have to ask an authoritative server again / every time some host asks about domain.com). TTL values vary, usually they are set to about 1 day == 86400 seconds.
You can actually check if the DNS server of your ISP cached the result, by asking the ISP DNS server explicitly, using the commands:
Please note -- there is a tremendous distinction between your ISP and your ISP's DNS server.  There is nothing forcing you to use your ISP's DNS server.  You can run a recursive server yourself, you can use google's DNS servers, you can use OpenDNS.
