I'm assuming the easiest way to set the time of the last run is to touch a markerfile.  That I can do.  Where I am stuck is getting rsync to only sync files newer than the markerfile. I don't think rsync has a -newer option.  I'm assuming I might need to run some other commands that will create an include list but I am a real *nix noob.
I'm trying to get rsync just to sync files that have changed and or been created since it's last run.  This is an attempt to stop my NAS servers disks from spinning up every time rsync runs even when there is no file to copy across.
If the disks don't spin up how are you going to check for newer versions of the files stored on them? rsync will only sync files that are newer or have been changed on the source (unless using non-default option like -c, --checksum              skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size.
If you don't want to spin up the disks you can, as you say use a marker file on another disk that is always spinning I suppose. So you could write a simple bash script that fudges this together but is sounds like the wrong approach to me.
try using rsync with the -u option, only sync's files which have been modified. Still causes disk to spin however reduces that actual execution time.
