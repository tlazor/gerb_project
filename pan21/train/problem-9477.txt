These errors are exactly correlated with reset TCP connections when someone is attempting to connect and logon through port 3389 ms-wbt-server. If the person fails the system security "black box", then the incoming connection is aborted with a reset packet. The error message you are seeing is then thrown up to the Windows Systems Log.  If you are experiencing a lot of these still, then you might want to change the listening port from 3389 to something else, and see if the errors diminish.
