Ideally, you shouldn't be hitting loads > 2.0. Since small instances have only one CPU, any load above 1.0 means you already have half of your processes waiting for available CPU slices. A medium instance should be enough.
I am using 2 workers on Ubuntu, with latest nginx (stable), the network throughput is around 2Mbps and system load average is around 2 to 3.
I want to know because if my nginx is cpu bounded (e.g. due to SSL), I will need to upgrade to a faster instance.
Be sure to turn off gzip compression and also i suggest to add SPDY patch http://nginx.org/patches/spdy/README.txt (firefox and chrome supports SPDY) which will greatly increase load time of SSL pages.
If your top shows that nginx is the only process eating CPU and your instance type is m1.small, thats for sure means that nginx is in BAD state. 
A good article explaining how to measure system load: http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2009/07/31/understanding-load-averages
The problem with EC2's small instances is that you don't have 100% CPU time available, only bursts. Once your instance starts keeping the CPU busy consistently, it gets throttled.
