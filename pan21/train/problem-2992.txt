There are ways to do the high level testing, but I'll throw in my 2 cents about this approach first! I think if you instead implement unit testing on each aspect of your game, it would be a better test. If you make some test that runs whatever function is called when you input that key sequence, just provide the unit test with all key sequences that you think might break the function. If it works for all key sequences, then you know the internals for that function are good and you can go on to test the link between the input box and that function. That test is easier and you only need to make sure the data gets passed to the function. After all of that works, then the testing above that is usually done by play testers, or in your case you. The top level test would need to be done either way.
Now, to answer your question, before I knew what unit testing was, I used something called workspace macro recorder to do exactly what you're asking. Given, your program may need some sort of testing that I'm not thinking of, but if your program fits in the general scope that I'm thinking, my previous approach should be more helpful.
