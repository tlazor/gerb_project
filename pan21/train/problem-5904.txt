Manual updates mean that ownership usually needs to be reset, though this can be automated to some point: with in-place updates (e.g. Git/Hg or rsync or such), you can set the "setgid" mode on the webapp's data directories using chmod g+s, and the group (the :nginx part) will be automatically applied to all new files inside.
For the main location, /usr/share/webapps is fine. You don't always need symlinks, often it is more convenient to configure the location directly in httpd.conf; for example:
This sped up updating our two Moodle installations from 30–60 minutes (downloading; extracting; making a backup; re-adding modules; re-applying local patches) to just 1–3 minutes (git pull).
For manually installed apps, consider downloading the Git or Hg repository if there is one. You'll be able to update to the latest (stable or development) version with one command and keep track of your own code changes if you end up making any. (And if someone finds a way to litter your files with malware, that also takes moments to clean up.)
For configuration, it depends on your download method. The system-packaged webapps usually have their config files symlinked to /etc, mostly to conform better with the Linux filesystem hierarchy.
Alternatively, you could create your own packages for pacman, which will then take care of removing the old files and extracting new ones to the right place.
