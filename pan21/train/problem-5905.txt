It turns out that the Client switches had a VTP Password set.  Unfortunately, there is no way to know what the vpt password is on a client switch ("sh vtp password" only works on the server switch).  To fix, I reset the passwords on all switches, then made a VLAN change, which was successfully pushed out.  For future reference, here is how it was done:
SO.... what I was looking for was an answer as to if we were to just remove the password from the client switch would we hose the vlan database and have to recreate and reconfigure interfaces.... I did a test with 2 switches I had here in the office and set it up exactly as I had in the office but in PRODUCTION and the answer is NO... You're SAFE to remove the password. Once I did so the VLAN that was created before and didn't propagate to the client "did" once the password was removed. I also created new vlans on the server switch to test and it propagated to the client.
This discussion helped me out when searching for a similar issue and how I resolved with switches in production..
I recently replaced the switch that was functioning as the VLAN server for the rest of the network.  Since the replacement however, I have not been able to push any new VLANs to the Client switches.  Is there any way to force the client VLAN database to be updated?  The old VLANs are all working fine -- it is just not receiving new ones. 
* Any new VLANs created on the server switch did not propagate to the client switch. after searching and coming across this discussion I found that the client switch had a VTP password set while the server did not. This "2nd switch", the client was from another office and added to this office with only the one switch. Our VLANs standard across the board at each site and this client switch was a client at the other office it came from. So when added to this office/switch the previous vlans were already there and interfaces could be added but again nothing newly created populated the client switch.
