I do not know if I had a faulty installation of AVG Free to begin with, but I do know that I have had no further issues with this particular problem.  Also, it was not only PowerShell and the NuGet package manager being hung, but in the end, my iPhone also refused to sync in iTunes during the issue (though I could open the photos on the phone within Windows Explorer at the same time, and I would have to reboot to resolve the issue temporarily).
At any rate, I seem to have resolved my own issue as well as a couple others.  I thank everyone for their suggestions, and I hope my own issue's resolution helps someone out there running into a like problem.
OK.  I am absolutely certain I've resolved the issue.  After careful consideration, I uninstalled AVG antivirus as a last resort.  As it was no longer completing scans at the same time the PowerShell hang would be happening, I figured I had nothing left to lose.
I've had over a week uptime a few times since uninstallation, and the issue with PowerShell hanging upon opening a window has not recurred since then.  So it would appear in my case, AVG Antivirus (Free edition) was the culprit.  My earlier confidence that AVG wasn't causing it was incorrect in my case, and was more peculiar as it persisted through a later version update of the antivirus software as well.  I also had to use the uninstaller program from AVG's website as the initial attempt at uninstallation failed (and the PowerShell issue was persisting before I made the first uninstall attempt).
