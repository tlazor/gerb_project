Air compressor is great as long as you're holding fan blades while cleaning around them - else it can get pretty expensive.
Also, you'll get your computer the cleanest if you open the case and get really close to the dusty parts.  A few years of dust can encase the boards, cards, and other hardware in there!
If you use a blower (like canned air), rather than a sucker (like a vacuum), be sure to use it in a well ventilated place.  You may want to consider even doing it outdoors.  Otherwise, you'll just blow the dust into the computer's own environment, and it will become dusty again more quickly.
Compressed air is definitely a must for all the computer components, but it does have the problem of sending dust all over you case. So, for cleaning all the excess dust from the case, which I never forget when doing yearly cleanings, I just use a lightly damp paper towel to do a quick clean on your case only. You can also do this on your fans, just make sure you remove the grills first and make sure that they are dry before putting them back in to your case. 
Although it might not be the safest option, I just open the computer up and get the vacuum cleaner and suck all the dust up. I have never had any problems with that.
Keep in mind, fan blades inside of the computer shouldn't be allowed to spin while you're cleaning.  This could cause damage.
