This would suggest a MTU issue (Wikipedia link) where your router is sending large packets that another router is not capable of handling.
Hence the normal recommendation is to use the default settings except when you are having trouble and in that case you keep reducing your MTU settings (in steps of 10) until you find a value that works reliably.
But a problem can occur if your router sends a large packet to another router that is not able to cope with. In this situation, your router will assume the packet got lost and send it again and since that will also fail, it sends it again and again until it gives up). 
The default setting can depend on what type of network connection your are using. For example the default on an internal windows network is 1500, whereas the default for internet connections using PPPoE is 1492. 
So why doesn't everyone use a small MTU setting that everyone can cope with. Well every packet sent has an overhead , eg information about who the packet is from and who it is to be sent to and also it must get a reply back indicating that the packet was received correctly. Hence the smaller the packet size, the more packets you need to send and the greater the overhead and that slows down your connection. (For example, for performance reasons I understand that XBOX live requires a MTU of at least 1364)
Reducing the MTU on your router would mean your router would send smaller packets that the other router can accept and everything starts working.
In laymans terms, all communication across the network/internet is broken down into little packets, but the size of the packet is not fixed. The MTU (maximum transmission unit) is the maximum size that a device (eg your router) is supposed to send. If you try to send a larger packet, your device should split the packet into two packets and send them separately.
