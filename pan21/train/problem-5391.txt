This would look through the /home/user/storage directory and locate files greater than 1MB. You can also add -exec to the line to perform actions on the files found.
One of the systems downloads large files and creates symlinks in the shared space. The other system (a windows system) thinks that there is not space left.
You might also limit the total size of a directory by mounting the directory from the virtual filesystem (a file):
Another method I thought of would be to schedule a cronjob to run on the linux machine every minute or at an interval of your choosing that executes a script that looks for any files greater than 1M and either removes them or moves them to another directory for review.
I'm affraid that it's possible to set the maximum file size limit for the whole system only (for each and every file).
What I would like to do is to limit the size of files in one folder in linux. In other words, the directory (and sub-directories) will only contain files up to say 1MB. Anything larger than that will be disregarded. Can that be done?
