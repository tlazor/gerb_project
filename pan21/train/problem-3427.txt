There is lot of debate on this whether MySQL really and completely follow ACID properties , and everyone have their own opinion . As per MySQL doc 
A large caveat with ACID compliance is that for performance reasons most databases use an isolation level that does not guarantee the "I" part - this is within the ANSI SQL specs. To offer proper Isolation you need to guarantee that transactions are serialisable, an isolation level that some DBs don't even support. For example MySQL+InnoDB defaults to "repeatable read", while MS SQL Server defaults to the slightly more strict "read committed", both offer "serialisable" but it is not the default. Why isn't is always supported and usually not the default? Performance: a full isolation requirement can significantly limit concurrency.
Based on my knowledge MySQL is ACID  compliance ...however hope this answer will give you more clearification enter link description here  .
But we should not forget that with the newly versions , MySQL has improved a lot and i personally appreciate Oracle that they are optimizing it in a very good way. So previous version may not follow ACID , but today it is. 
However , Let me try to put all properties one by one how MySQL with Innodb  follows these properties :
If you use InnoDB or a similar storage engine then it should be ACID compliant (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InnoDB). myISAM, the old default and still very commonly used, most definitely isn't ACID compliant. If you mix the two (you might find simpler table types perform better and are acceptable for volatile data that can and will be reproduced again, such as staging tables for ETL processes) then you solution will not be entirely compliant.
There are a few good articles on the subject. For one example http://www.bailis.org/blog/when-is-acid-acid-rarely/ is a short and informative place to start with some interesting discussion in the comments.
