I don't have a full answer for you but some experience that might help round out the discussion. We initially used the emulated drivers on our Red Hat machines but the linux admin complained that network performance was abysmal. Eventually we got the synthetic drivers working via the Virtual Machine Additions and that made a big difference (I don't have proof or details, so take that with a grain of salt). 
Separately, we sometimes image VMs over the network and when we do that we must use the emulated NIC on a Windows box because the synthetic NIC doesn't support PXE booting. Once the imaging is complete, we replace the emulated NIC with a synthetic one. Again, I'm talking about Windows here (not linux) but it's another difference.
In general, my understanding is that the emulated devices emulate older, more established or more generic devices that pretty much every OS or distribution will have built-in support for. In this regard they are more universal. The synthetic devices don't emulate any other devices that your OS or distribution would recognize and thus, you need Microsoft-provided drivers for them the likes of which you get by installing the VM Additions.
