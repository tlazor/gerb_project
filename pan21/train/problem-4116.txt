So, unless you have 400,000V emanating from your server room, you're at no greater risk for cancer than when you're taking a trip in a plane or spending a day at the beach.
As for static electricity; it could be that your server room is generating the static electricity, or it could be that you're as dry as sand paper and should consider using lotion more often.  If it really bothers you, convince your boss to remove the carpeting from your office or get a humidifier.  Note, your server room should be mostly dry; running between 45-50% humidity.  Anything less than 30% puts your server room at high risk for static discharge issues.  Anything more than 70% puts your server room at risk for indoor rain.
If you're really concerned about it, get an electrician in there to check stuff out.  They'll tell you whether or not your server room is safe.
Static electricity has not been known to cause cancer.  I've read a some articles that summarized studies claiming static electricity led to increased cancer risks, but they also prefaced the research by studying people who sleep right next to a meterboards, junction boxes, substations or power lines with 400,000V.  Note: most of these articles reference studies done in the 60's and 70's, during a time when one computer was the size of your server room, and using vacuum tubes.  If you're really paranoid about it, schedule a sleep test with a local sleep clinic; exposure to high levels of static electricity over long periods of time have been suggested to mess with internal bio-rhtymics/bio-electricity.  Have them monitor your sleep patterns; if you're wavering between insomnia and restlessness, you may have a valid concern or you may have a medical issue you need addressed.
