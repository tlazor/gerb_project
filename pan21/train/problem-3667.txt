I have a NAS wired to the WiFi router. Since the WiFi router distributes IP on a different subnet than the wired router, only WiFi-enabled computers can access the NAS.
But when PC1 send a packet to PC2, the WiFi router will see that there is no client connected with that MAC address, so it will broadcast the packet to all of it's ports.  
The question could be restated as If my WiFi access point is in bridge mode, and I attach a NAS to it, will packets going from a WiFi-connected computer to the NAS transit through the main router?
When PC1 sends a packet to the NAS, the WiFi router will check what MAC address the packet is bound for. Seeing as it's for the NAS, the Wifi router will route the packet to Port 2 on itself.  
If I change the WiFi router to bridge mode, will the transfer speed between WiFi-connected computers and the NAS decrease? Or will the WiFi bridge route packets going to the NAS directly, without going through the main router? My fear is that changing to bridge mode might force all traffic to pass through the main router (computer -> WiFi AP -> main -> WiFi AP -> NAS instead of computer -> WiFi AP -> NAS).
The wifi router will keep a map of MAC addresses within it's memory so it knows which port to send packets to.
The Main router will then receive the packet with the destination MAC address of PC2, and see that it's bound for PC2, and send it to port 1 on itself.  
My current network configuration comprises two routers, one of which [main] takes care of the wired part of my home network, the other of which [wifi] provides WiFi connectivity. The wired router is also connected to the internet.
