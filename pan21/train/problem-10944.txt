What limits the data transfer rate over a single lane/cable? The maximum data transfer rate depends on quality/robustness of signal encoding in the channel (pre-emphasis and eqilization, link training, 8B/10B or 128b/132b encoding, etc.), and amount of effort devoted to quality of cable interconnect (uniformity of transmission lines, low signal loss, low cross-talk, and interface impedance matching across connectors). This means cost.
So you naturally have 256 > 20 >10 >5 for PCIe16x ->Thunderbolt3 ->USB3.1_Gen2 -> Gen1 lineup of interfaces.
USB Type-C is not "faster" than USB3.0. However, USB3.1 Gen2 data rate (10Gbps) is faster than Gen1 speed (5Gbps), all over a single full-duplex data lane. All these rates can be implemented over Type-C connector, including all USB2.0 legacy rates. So it is incorrect to equate "Type-C" with USB3.1 Gen2 speed alone. USB3 uses only one lane.
Thunderbolt-3 is designed with two bi-directional lanes for up to 10 Gbits/s raw rate per lane, with up to total 20 Gbps full duplex over two lanes in parallel, and 40Gbps one-way for video display applications.
For the PCIe all transmission line matching can be done at simulation level within a single mainboard with well-characterized slot connectors, all under control of one developer. With shorter trace length and standardized matched layout of add-on cards, this allows for faster data rate per channel, currently at 16Gbps (GT/s).
PCIe 16x has 16 lanes for data per a device (card), running in parallel. Each lane is running at 2.5Gbps/5/8/16Gbps (depending on implemented version of the interface, v1x - v4x). It makes the throughput of the latest PCIe 16x v.4.0 interface effectively at 256Gbps.
When longer distances are involved, and third-party manufacturers (of cables) are involved, resulting reliability of transmission on realistic cable-connector combinations decreases, and the data rates have to be decreased.
