Lets assume that it does work okay with just your pc using the cable in the modem (without the router connected). Now test the cable through the router and see if you still get the good speeds. If not, your router is doing something or one of the clients is.
Test if you have good speeds if you place a device very close to the antennas of the wifi. If its not good, its a configuration setting for wifi that is slowing things down, either on your client or the router. If it works okay, then it is either the distance to the router that just is too far or there are surrounding interference signals.
Lets assume that with the cable in the router, and the router connected via cable to the modem, everything is working perfectly, you have a wifi problem.
Wifi can be your cause for slowness. A misconfigured wifi network, as well as how far you are away can all degrade your performance. To fully thest this, you should connect using a cable to your router and do a speedtest. If possible connect directly to your modem and do a speedtest. If the speedtest is still slow, the problem is not at your side, but on the internet service provider (ISP) side. In this case, you'll have to contact support.
