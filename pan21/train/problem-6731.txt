There are only two ways to have multiple domains secured that use the same IP. Either use different service ports for each cert (this option sucks) or find a CA that allows SubjectAltName within certificates.
With SubjectAltName you can define as many DNS entries per certificate as you like. Meaning one certificate will authenticate several domains. This is beyond wildcards as the domains don't have to have anything in common. As an example of this you can check out CAcert which allows this.
That's no longer the case if using Apache 2.2.12 implementing SNI, a single address is no longer required per certificate. Hopefully we'll see more of this available to shared hosting now.
Does your host not allow you to have Dedicated IPs. You should be able to find a host that allows you to purchase a plan with shared hosting, but dedicated IPs. We are doing this with Server Intellect www.serverintellect.com for example right now. Basically, they just charge us a separate small fee for each dedicated IP we require.
