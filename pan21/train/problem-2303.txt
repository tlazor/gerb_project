Try using adobe premier, Sony Vegas, Avid etc on your pc installed on Windows, there are plenty of Windows editing programs that are equally as good if not better than Mac software. 
Unless you have a crazy powerful pc its not going to happen even if the vm did support the graphics card, you have to think that when the vm is running it isn't using all the memory / cpu the system has, because some of that is allocated to running Windows 7 itself, and the VM host software, where as if you run editing software on windows itself you will be getting a hell of a lot more of the pc's memory / cpu allocated to the program as your not having to run Windows 7 AND the VM host software AND the mac OS software AND the video editing software, you only having to run Windows 7 AND the Video Editing software.
Is it possible to use the native graphic card of my pc (Windows 7) when I run my vmware 7? I am trying to run Final Cut Pro X on my guest OS (Lion) but it says the graphic setting doesn't support Final Cut Pro X. Any fix? Thanks.
No, this is not currently possible.  'They' are working on this with the VT-d extensions to CPUs, but almost no software actually supports this yet. AFAIK, only Vmware ESX has support for this feature, but this is an Enterprise product and would not be useful at all on your desktop.
You will get on a lot better than trying to virtualise your video editing, as running a virtual machine takes quite a lot of overhead to start with so you would be far far better off just running the video editing software on your physical pc and turning off the virtual machine.
