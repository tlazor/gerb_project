There are $p \times q$ stars in that table. You might relate this to the area of a rectangle. Make sure you draw all the cells as identically-sized squares (unlike my figure above!), say that the length of the side of the square is the length unit, then the total area not including the labels is the number of cells and that's $p \times q$.
In the special case where $p = q$, you get $p^2$. If you add a third choice that also has $p$ possibilities, you can still present it visually as a 3-dimensional model, although it's harder and you can expect some students to have a hard time. Show how three choices with $p$, $q$ and $r$ possibilities respectively give you a total of $p \times q \times r$ possibilities. With the same number of possibilities $p$ for each choice, you get $p^3$.
This doesn't call for a metaphor from programming. It's rather the opposite, you get it for programming applications such as the number of times through a nested loop because you get the math.
At this point you've discreetly planted the seed of the idea of recursion. “When you add another dimension, …” — that's the induction step. Each time you add a new dimension, with $p$ choices in each dimension, the total number of choices is multiplied by $p$.
There are $p^2$ choices with $2$ dimensions, $p^3$ choices with $3$ dimensions. Oh and by the way there are $p$ choices with $1$ dimension, and $p = p^1$. $1 \mapsto p^1$, $2 \mapsto p^2$, $3 \mapsto p^3$, can you see a pattern? (You may or may not mention $p^0$ at this point, depending on whether you think students will get it.)
For the product rule, there's a pretty natural geometric presentation. If there are $p$ choices for A and $q$ choices for B, place the choices for A in rows and the choices for B in columns:
The numbers increase pretty fast, so it soon becomes unwieldy to count them all. Now is a good opportunity to demonstrate how to go from the two-choice case (two dimensions) to the three-choice case (three dimensions). When you add another dimension of length $r$ to $p \times q$, the number of choices is multiplied by $r$. When you add another dimension of length $r$ to $p \times p$, the number of choices is multiplied by $p$.
