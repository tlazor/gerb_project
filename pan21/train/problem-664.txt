After some while my manager asked me to files that might be on that laptop. So I searched the backup disk but only found the records and photos of children aged 11 to 14 and only the female ones and only of a particular hair colour. 
...and no, I'm not a system administrator but that's what happens when I have to spend one weekend installing Vista on all the laptops and computers at the company.
A user knew that he couldn't get around the firewall filter for web browsing, but found a way around it.  He had a group of 5 friends, and they would email a dirty picture in an email attachment in a ring between them all.  
I worked as a sys/app/net admin at a high school (age 11 -> 18) and discovered that the laptop I got was the one my predecessor used (he was on sick leave), before formatting the machine I made a backup of the HD in case there was anything on that shouldn't be deleted.
Its been two months since I did this. Many have already changed their user picture but the guest picture is still there.
For the guest picture, I have set up Pedobear with a thumbs up with the words Pedobear Seal of Approval
Nobody in the company knows who is Pedobear and they just assumed that the bear is a cute cartoon character.
