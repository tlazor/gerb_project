this logs the output of the program from print and also the logging information, but all the tracebacks are sent to my local terminal where i excecuted the the script and my script gets stuck waiting for any exception to happen in the remote program.
You almost had it... However, all three pipes need to be re-directed to background a process via ssh.  Std In, Std Out, Std Err.  Thus:  
This gets me almost exactly what i want, loggin information and python tracebacks, but i do not get any of the information displayed using print from python, which i need.
I have a python app in a remote server that i need to debug, when I run the app locally it prints some debug information (including python tracebacks) that i need to monitor.
Im trying to redirect all the output of the program to a file so I can monitor the remote output using tail -F, here I found the following command to redirect the outputs:
note:  &> is the equivalent of redirecting std out and std error at the same time. In other words, it is the shortened version of ' >> /var/log/myapp.log 2>&1'
