.. it's just a nightmare. :-/ Torrent(s) can NOT be stopped, during the check, and deleting .old files doesn't bypass the check. I have it not to auto-start downloads, so they can be launched one-at-a-time; but, it's ridiculous having to wait a few minutes every-so-often (and only one HDD, so the system is pretty much locked during that time) 
What I get, using uTorrent 3.4 (build 30635), is a few ~30GB files keep having to be re-checked (for one reason, or another; looks like program crash, due 2 memory crash most probably) and this is taking AGES on an ok-system: 
Another solution is to downgrade to a previous version. I know for certain that 3.3 (build 29333) works fine. But you'll have to search for that yourself (plus i'm not sure if there will be any problems with your current torrents when you downgrade)
As mentioned above, a sure solution is to update to version 3.4 (Alpha). I just did and it is working fine.
a work around that seems to work for me is to stop all torrents, start them again then exit UTorrent - go to your AppData/Roaming folder under your user folder and delete all the .old files then restart UTorrent - all of my 6 downloads running now.
