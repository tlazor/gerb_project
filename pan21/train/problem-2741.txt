That's not to say that I won't convert parts of my diagrams into pretty pictures for powerpoint time during budget presentation to the suits.  But those diagrams have a different purpose.
The problem with putting everything on one diagram is that it gets messy.  In our case the layer2/layer3 jumble made everything too complicated that we just had to split them out into separate documents.
It might for example make sense to diagram the logical layout of your network but things like services may be better dealt with in a database, which makes management and searching so much easier. If you still want to have pretty pictures of everything create as many diagrams as are necessary to illustrate what you want but don't try to put it all in one diagram.
I also dislike specific object templates because when you have them you either waste all your time trying to get symbols for everything (oh no!  I don't have a symbol for my HP thing!) and then trying to scale them all so they look right.  With box-and-cloud you are forced to concentrate on the information, not on making it a pretty picture.
Each diagram has a different purpose.  By limiting diagrams to a purpose, you stand a much better chance of being able to communicate important information.
There is no one answer that can fit all our needs and situations but I suggest you first decide whether or not a diagram is in fact the best method to document what you're interested in. Then diagram exactly the information you need. No more, no less. Too little tends to make the exercise pointless, whereas too much just makes it harder to read and use.
All of my diagrams are typically viso generated, box-and-cloud diagrams, in that the only symbols I use are boxes (for routers or computers) and clouds (for "networks", either specific like a particular subnet, or general like "the internet").
