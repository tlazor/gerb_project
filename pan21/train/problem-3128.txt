It should output detailed information about all of the hardware it sees, one of which should be the wi-fi adapter.
Trouble is, my "advanced" tab contains no such setting. Fair enough, says I. Off I go to track down the "official" wifi drivers for my system on the HP site. Which shows this;
I have  a pavilion 17z-p100. I did a reinstall recently and when I tried to use a couple of freeware mac spoofers I didn't get too far (various crashes, and TMAC was working fine before reinstall). Finally, I ran across a youtube video showing a "locally administered mac address" setting under wifi adapter properties>advanced tab. 
Now, obviously I could keep cycling through various adapters until I strike it rich, but that is... suboptimal. Tomorrow I will of course reach out to HP support. This may or may not be productive. And I am aware that both windows networking and command-line ipconfig return a make/model for the adapter. But, if they fail to produce the soft mac address setting (which was working before) why in the world should I believe them?
