This is handled differently by different versions of Linux [ Ubuntu creates a lot more files then CentOS/Redhat for example ] and can be quite easily changed.  (Look at /etc/syslog.conf or /etc/rsyslog.conf).
Compounding this is that some programs (fail2ban for example) monitor logs for activity and act on it - having multiple logs provides for better responsiveness and easier configuration.
Similarly if a particular application is not behaving as expected, cranking the debug information up might be desirable, but you don't want this level of debug information mixed in with your logs.
Ya they pretty important thing for bug fixing if you have problem with your user application,kernel,hardware or shell you can prefer using 
In addition to different services (which can be logged to the same or different places) there are different levels of logging.  
The rationale behind this flexibility must be to allow system administrators to get the right balance for their needs - for example if the system is a mail server, it may be useful to split off the incoming mail and outgoing mail from the general server logs to make tracking what is happening in certian cases easier.
