Today I tried to connect to my ftp account with Cyberduck. There was a popup screen saying that I had an "Unsecured FTP connection" and that "The server supports encrypted connections. Do you want to switch to FTP-SSL?". I clicked on the "change" button which led to another popup claiming that the certificate was not trusted.  I didn't take it seriously - I know it was wrong! - and connected to the server. I was trying to download a file, but the file could not be downloaded. I managed to disconnect and connect again several times to download the file, which was to no avail. I decided to read the contents of the certificate upon which I came to know that I did not know the cert. It was not mine, because I had not made any ssl certs at all for my ftp account.
Now my question is if my FTP account is compromised? I changed the password, but I do now know if any malicious codes are injected into my server. 
You are making unsecured FTP connections, so anyone who can intercept your packets can compromise your account.
