Is there any technology that I am not aware of that can simplify the setup process for the end user? The perfect scenario would be a virtual machine or container containing the whole environment that can somehow be converted to a single binary which can be installed/executed.
Currently there is no smart way of deployment whatsoever at all. Everything has to be installed manually. Depending on the system I also get issues regarding networking and so on from time to time. I also created another question here where I first thought about using Docker.
I am developing a piece of software which consists of a Node.js application which controls a virtual machine that runs Android-x86. Also there are some pieces of the Android SDK like ADB the software depends on.
While researching if I can solve this using Docker I came up with solutions that require Kubernetes as well. I want to deploy the software to non-tech savvy users as well. So I cannot afford to have Docker and Kubernetes as dependencies due to the complexity of the installation process.
