Last week I took my T410 open as it overheated once again and I expected the fan to be full of dust. The fan was clean and the only way it can suck ambient air seems to be from above, that is, through the keyboard assembly.
If you have an external graphics card, ensure your using the onboard intel one if you don't need the graphics power. The PCI Express ones can get really warm.  If your doing video stuff, depending on the encoder, you might not need the GPU, just the CPU.
My T-410 overheats while on the dock when performing intensive tasks, such as rendering video. Is there a piece of hardware I can purchase that will actively cool the bottom of the dock? Something more powerful than just a stand with fans built into it (maybe something with some kind of refrigerant looping around inside it).
Sorry for necro-bumping â€“ even though this is an old question, there are still quite a few T410 series devices around as low-end laptops.
Also, we have had two T410s's recently (based on the same components) that have had similar problems. The tech that came said there wasn't much thermal paste, but when I called Lenovo and mentioned heat issues, they quickly routed the ticket to another group, which sent out the tech with a new motherboard and stuff.. (although we have onsite support)
