To troubleshoot this I'd suggest using PING in a CMD window - first to your gateway, then to your DNS server, and finally, to the target address. 
If it says "Waiting for" then that means that it has already resolved the host name into an IP address.
The reason it seems to go on forever is that you are getting SOME packets through during this process. 
Then the web page itself, being comprised of many more packets, could be having to have a lot of them resent.  This can cause long delays.  
I'm running Firefox 3.0.6 on CentOS 5.3, I have an ethernet connection to a WRT54G v5 router that is connected with the radio modem (Wifi).
I don't know if this is a very generic question, but I want to know if it happened to someone else out there.
What you are describing could be a marginal connection, where the packets to DNS can get through because they are small and few, so a few retries will ultimately give the result.  
There is a strange behaviour in my laptop, sometimes when I want to open a site, say stackoverflow.com, my browser stays "looking for" or "waiting for" that domain. Apparently doesn't find it right away.
What I usually do is ping that domain and after a moment the browser responds (sometimes its necessary reload the page).
