Failing that, I would give Dell technical support a call and explain your problem as it is still under warranty.  It would save you some time if you ran through the diagnostics (F12 on boot up and then select the diagnostic option) before calling.  It might save them getting you to do it while on the phone.
In the first instance, maybe give the keyboard a damn good blow with a can of compressed air, in case there is debris under the keys.  Biscuits are GREAT for screwing up keyboards.
(sorry if this does not apply to you-) Over here in the UK, if you tell them that you're comfortable changing the keyboard and ask nicely, they will just send the part and let you do it yourself.  Not sure whether this will work in your neck of the woods but worth a go nevertheless, nothing to lose right?
Trying to fix it yourself might end in a completely broken key.  If you are lucky enough to remove the key without snapping the plastic, the scissor mechanism is a pain the backside to put back together again.
