We don't know why, but email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird) are downloading again all the mails that were stored. Is there any way to force the clients to download only from now?
It is entirely up to the client whether to delete old mail from the server once it has fetched it, or to leave it on the server.  If it is configured to leave the mail on the server, then it avoids fetching it again next time by keeping track of the mail UUIDs.  If you configure the client to fetch  mail from a different server, it throws out that old list of previously fetched UUIDs.
We have two servers with Merak Mail Server, serving a considerable number of accounts (15000). We had a terrible problem with our storage server, and we've been forced to move the mails to other server.
As Doon stated in his answer, the most likely cause is that the UIDL has changed due to the fact that the messages have been moved to a new server. I'm certain the server would assign it's own new UIDL to each message and as a result, the client believes (rightfully) that these are new messages and proceeds to download them all again. I don't see any way to avoid this with the way that POP is implemented other than for the client to use TOP, which may not be implemented in the client.
Leaving the mail on the server with POP3 has several problems and so is not recommended.  If your users want to keep mail on the server, you should switch to IMAP instead.
Does the new server have a different name and IP address?  If so, then the clients don't believe it is the same server as before, and therefore, the email it contains aren't the same ones it already fetched.
