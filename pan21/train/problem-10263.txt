Remember that MySQL grants go from most specific to most general (e.g. if user@10.0.0.1 connects, and there are users user@10.0.0.1 and user@10.0.0.* which have different grants, the most specific matching username is used).
For reports I want the user to only be able to see reports database and not main database. I created A user  'username@%' for the reports plugin in the server and gave it vie,select,execute privileges on reports db.
If you have multiple rows returned, you've created multiple  users with different host portions.  Check these and remove/fix if necessary.  
I would suggest starting by checking you haven't created multiple users with different host portions accidentally:
What should I do to prevent them from seeing the other database. In short: when developer logs in from reporting plugin, they should only see the report database.
 Now when the developer connects to database using those credentials from reports plugin, they report that they are able to see the other database and all it's tables as well.
