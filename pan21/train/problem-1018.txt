Instead you should invent your own. Use a different grid and different block sizes to help provide some uniqueness.
I'm not a lawyer so take my legal advice with that in mind, but I did make a version of this game. It's an Android game called Obstruction and I used it as a project to teach myself programming. I did not seek out any kind of licensing because, with so many clones available, it seemed that this wasn't an issue. I realized the puzzle doesn't have to use the usual 6x6 grid, so I made levels that are a little more abstract. Any shape works as long as it's made with right angles and the puzzle is solvable. I hand drew the designs for the 100 levels in my game, so I, personally, would recommend doing the same as opposed to copying other puzzles. Also, Obstruction has 7 different themes, none of which have anything to do with cars. The cars concept is what the very first game of this kind, Rush Hour, used and it's very over done. So my advice is don't worry about being the same, but try to be different.
I don't think there is a whole lot of complexity behind the type of game. It's a relatively simple block sliding puzzle where the goal is to free some specific block from the play field. You aren't likely to find deep tomes of lore on such a simplistic concept.
You could look for solutions or spoiler guides for existing games (for example, all of the solutions for The Heist, an iOS game that has a sliding block puzzle mini-game, are available online. But I wouldn't recommend that because you'd then be copying their puzzles. 
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice; you should consult a lawyer for proper legal advice. That said, the idea itself for the game is unlikely to be protected in any capacity as it is very difficult to do so. What you want to avoid is copying the name, artistic assets, and probably the puzzles, of any other instance of this game that is out there.
