Suggestion: Obtain a machine that you see has this problem. Make sure this is not a priority machine, where if the hotfix causes a problem will adversly effect anything. I suggest having all the latest windows updates period, especially the service packs but doing 1 at a time can better help troubleshoot the issues and cause less impact to the company.
One of the biggest issues that cause what you are facing is the fact you probably have computers that are using Microsoft Outlook 2003 that have not been updated since BEFORE Outlook '07 has come out. This would cause an error due to the older software not knowing how to communicate to '07. The best possible solution is to have all your computers updated with the latest Microsoft updates. I know in some environments this isn't always possible due to the fact an update has the potential of not being supported by certain software you are running in your environment...
I would suspect that one or more of these files are out of date, perhaps through a third party program or unsuccessful updates.
The latest KB that I have found at Microsoft is from October 9, 2011. As you can see at the below website, the exact error message you described is listed. Please remember this is a "possible" fix... not guranteed to solve your problem.
