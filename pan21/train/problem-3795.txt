Check out Sumo Logic, it offers a cloud to cloud integration with Akamai, with rich out-of-the-box content, utilizing cloud monitor. Setup is a breeze, and you don't have to concern yourself with batch downloading/processing anything on-prem.
Perl can be great for repeatability, but be careful, when dealing with large data sets (I've recently been playing with BGP dumps from a DFZ router) it's really easy to push even a big machine into swap if you leak any memory.
You can configure the Log delivery option to send you logs in "Combined" format. So you can use any standard tool of your choice (such as awstats or similar).
Tools like Splunk etc. seem like they might be nice for ad-hoc stuff where a simple unix pipe might not work, but don't appear to be a good solution for more permanent reports.
You could simply use Awstats or similar, most web log processing tools can be told to to use a different input format.
