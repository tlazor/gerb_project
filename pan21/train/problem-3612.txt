You could add this to complexity to your game in later levels (or as bonus levels). Two characters start in different areas of the level, and the player controls both with the same buttons. 
If you have ever played LittleBigPlanet 3, there are some bonus side levels which are side-scrolling puzzles where the controller controls 2 characters with the same analog stick. I can't find a clip at the moment.
Obviously having the player control 2 characters simultaneously would require really thought out level design, but it could add that extra layer you are looking for. Hope that helps.
Anyways, you hold the stick right and both characters go right; EXCEPT, if there is a wall to the right of character B, only character A will move to the right, while B walks in place.
Here's how this could work with the scenario you described: character A is hiding in the closet, with the closet door to the left and the rest are walls. The player can input patterns of up, right, or down to move character B (while keeping A in the closet) to advance the guard's patrol, and navigate character B to his or her destination. Once the guard moves past the closet, the player can move character A out of the closet.
