I've been looking up after market coolers for my CPU since it has been running hot recently. I see a lot of forums saying that this-or-that product will "Extend the life of your CPU" by making it run at lower temperature. That go me thinking, what signs and symptoms occur before a CPU hits end-of-life?
In short: the end user can't determine it. You'll need in depth knowledge of the architecture and test methods used to test silicon. A complete test might not even be possible anymore once it has been packaged. (Eg: put on little board with heat-spreader)
The symptoms can range from blue screens of death to the occasional retransmit of a network frame or miscolored pixel. Basically everything has bit that could fail, and the function will determine the severity of the symptoms.
Anyway, please let me know when you've worn out a silicon chip by using it inside specifications. The bathtub curve rising section is many years away from the point it becomes obsolete and slow.
The symptoms are most often linked to bad memory, which is more likely to suffer from problems due to being on a separate board, build to a price and often lacks self correcting mechanisms. (ECC)
I don't have a specific problem with my computer, I just want to know what to look for if/when my 3 year old 1g i7 starts to go.
To make matters worse, this is also the same behavior when the power supply is unstable, the clocks are too fast, or its running too hot.
