Scouring the internet, the difficulty lies in not having a uniform format standard for annotations in PDF files, and so far Adobe has supported FDF/XFDF export/import. Other PDF readers have their own ways of tackling annotations.
(And if anyone has an idea, how are annotations stored anyway in PDFs at the file-structure level? Can it be exported? I'm on Linux by the way and am comfortable with advanced command line tools if need be.)
So, as of this moment, we're stuck to FDF/XFDF. Adobe XI/DC delivers that with some loss of formatting. Yet if there are other alternatives, PDF-XChange Viewer (or it's newer cousin, the PDF-XChange Editor) works with exactly the same limitations. But they have a real upside: They don't slow down at all even at 2k+ annotations, which is so unlike Adobe Reader.
Is there a way for me to export my annotations from the old version of the PDF and import it to the new one?
I have a few hundred pages of highly annotated PDF file, which is mostly text, in the form of underlines, highlights, and (more) text annotations.
