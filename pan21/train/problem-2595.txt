The term "network performance" means different things to different people. As AdamB said, it depends on what you want to do. Testing what in some ways is a vague concept is, to say the least, a bit difficult. As far as the choice of OS goes, I suggest making that for reasons other than network performance, as it's unlikely any OS will perform significantly worse than the others in that area.
Running a web server? If it's Apache I'd suggest running it on Linux as the Windows versions are always a little behind in development and don't always run quite as well. Of course if you want to run IIS there's no choice and it has to be Windows.
File server? Base your choice on the clients. e.g. Samba shares on a Linux box using Active Directory authentication is still less than perfect. Windows to Windows, Linux to Linux or Mac to Mac simply makes sense.
I'd argue that network performance is unlikely to be a bottleneck for the majority of things that you're likely to be doing, and you should use other criteria (familiarity, support, cost) to choose your operating system.
Not trying to create a "holy war" thread, but I am trying to make a reasoned decision on whether to use Linux or Windows for network applications. To that end, I would like to gain a better understanding of the network performance of a Windows XP host and a Linux host, with proper metrics to make a good comparison of the two.
What would I need to do (or have) to effect that sort of performance comparison? Assume the same hardware specs for the machine and no unnecessary applications or services running on either machine.
