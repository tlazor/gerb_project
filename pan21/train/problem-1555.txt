My guess is that if you had the option to standardize the servers you are going to deploy to, you would have done that by now, so I am going to skip that suggestion.  What you are going to need to do is build scripts/MSIs etc. to automate the deployment process for the operations team.  It will take some time to setup, but removing the Ops team's manual intervention from the process is the only way to make it run smoothly.  Now I am not insulting their intelligence, far from it.  The problem is that they don't know how the code works.  They don't know what a config file with a bad value will look like.  They depend on you knowing that to help them and the reason why automation is key to solving your problem.  
My suggestion would be to setup virtual machines locally which mimic the various servers, so you can test over and over again how the install is going to work.  If your IT department is anything like mine, getting new servers will be difficult, as it involves budgeting and resource allocation etc.  Virtual machines remove a large part of the headache as you don't need new hardware, and input from anyone will be minimal as you'll only need to know how the servers are configured and then you can probably do the rest yourself.  VMs also allow you to quickly reset the machine to it's original state and try the install process again.
