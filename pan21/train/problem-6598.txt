The image will look blurred, which can strain your eyes on the long run. But it won't harm the display itself.
(None of this applies to old-school CRTs or other monitors with variable pixel size (pitch) and thus no native resolution. Also, some CRTs could actually be physically damaged by feeding them signals beyond their capabilities.)
Some monitors and/or display adaptors will stretch the image to fill the monitor's native resolution. Depending on how well they do so, you may not notice anything except a slight loss of sharpness. If this stretching is done badly, you will see entire lines of pixels doubled, distorting text and sharp curved or diagonal lines.
Other monitors and/or adaptors will just display the lower resolution image with a black border around it, wasting some of the size of the monitor but not distorting the image.
I have a LED monitor, which is used with a computer running Windows. What are the downsides of not using the monitor's native resolution?
In any case, there isn't much reason to use less than the native resolution of the monitor, but it isn't going to damage anything.
