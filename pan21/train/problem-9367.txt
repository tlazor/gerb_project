In my experience, the ones that haven't been updated for Lion support by now usually didn't work very well with OS X anyway (poor system integration).
My IT department restricts my access to the Screen Sharing part of Lion's preferences so I needed an alternative.  I was able to get RealVNC running as a server with a free license (phone and email required).  This was using 5.0.1 and Lion 10.7.4.  Very easy.
Actually teamviewer 7.0.11067 have a bug which provide to black screen view when you connect to your mac when it were in Economy Power mode... and it is sad.
Lion's built in VNC server works just fine, they just changed the authentication process and many clients are no-longer capable of logging on, especially ones that haven't been updated since Lion came out or where Mac compatibility is a low priority.
These days there are plenty of Lion compatible VNC clients available. I use it all the time with an iPad app I found, and it works great.
An alternative VNC Server could be RealVNC, an alternative to VNC itself could be Team Viewer it works fine on Lion and it is free for moderate private use.
