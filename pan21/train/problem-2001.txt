Say you want to get traffic from VLAN 7 to VLAN 8. A switch will happily carry the VLAN 7 traffic to a router, which will route it onto VLAN 8. Then the switch will happily carry the VLAN 8 traffic from the router. So the switch will do its part of switching inside each VLAN to allow the router to do its job of interconnecting the VLANs.
The switch will switch, no matter what. If that allows the VLANs to communicate with each other because the proper routing is in place, then it makes no difference whether the switch has an IP address or default gateway. All it's going to do is switch, and it can do that without a default gateway or IP address.
Something has to route between the VLANs, and the switch won't do that. But the switch will happily switch packets to and from the device that's doing the inter-VLAN routing.
I know that a router is necessary for VLANs to communicate with each othe, but I would like to know if both IP address and default gateway need to be configured on the switch in order for different vlans connected to them communicate with each other?
