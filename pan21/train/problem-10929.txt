Lets start with the gorilla in the room. Hard drives do fail - and gradual wear is the least of your worries since you might still have time to back up everything and restore it. That said, enterprise drives are designed for 24 hour duty cycles, and lots of companies use large arrays of consumer drives for storage. Google has a paper on this, and the part of interest to you is 
I've tended to see 3-5 year lifespans on consumer hard drives (and they run 24/7 with a lot of disk activity, so there's periods where they're constantly reading or writing, or not doing anything), and when they don't have major electromechanical failures (which are often unexpected), they just slow down gradually. Keep an eye on your drives (smart tests are nice), have backups (all hardware dies) and you should be fine.
In short, drive wear dosen't really matter as much in terms of reliability as you'd think, especially where you may have other failure modes. Considering you're using a nas, it should be monitoring for wear related failure modes (using smart) and have some mechanism for replacing the drives.
