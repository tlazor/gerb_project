First, if you've got devices running on two different subnets on the same logical/physical LAN, then you are going to have essentially zero security on that LAN between subnets. While you ~think~ the devices will be unable to access anything, you cannot be sure you won't have a rogue device. Because of this, I'm going to straight-up assume that this is not the case. Following that, it's fairly easy to set up a Linux Box with IPTables as a router. It's fairly detailed in the configuration of the linux box and some of the specifics may depend on exactly which distro you are running, but the basic box is two NICs, one plugged into each network, followed by some software that will do routing (Easy to find, even included in some distros) followed by your IPtables configuration. Plug NIC1 into 192.168.0.0/24 and NIC2 into 192.168.1.0/24 and you have a bridge between the two subnets for traffic that needs to travel between them.
Here's that second part: It would be far simpler for you to purchase (even a used) router from a reputable manufacturer than it would be for you to assemble and configure this linux box to do the same task. Most real routers are capable of doing ACLs, which is really about what IPtables would be doing for most of the config, and some routers are capable of doing Zone-based Firewalls with packet inspection. A used Cisco 1841 would not set you back much, and would be about as "legit" as the Linux RouterWall combo you're asking about. A little bit of google-fu and you can probably find enough Cisco CLI commands to straighten you out fairly quickly and get that box up and doing what you need it to do within less than twenty minutes. I'm not against anyone ever doing something the "hard way" just for the fun of it...but unless that's your goal, it seems to me like you're trying really hard to fix a problem with an answer that's more complicated than the problem itself.
