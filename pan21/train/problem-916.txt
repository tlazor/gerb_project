Due to a re-installation, my Windows 8 doesn't activate. It has been working without activation for a year now. The prompt comes up every couple of hours, but it seems to be actively stopped by streamlining programs such as Razer. You're fine to go indefinitely, methinks.
With all the uncertainty and doubts, I decided to conduct an experiment. I installed a clean Windows 8 Pro copy (a copy that I own and with a key that wasn't used anywhere yet) on a computer without Internet access. Here's what I found.
So... I guess that's it. There are no other differences from the activated copy of Windows 8 Pro that I found. Of course, because I didn't enable Internet access, online-related activities like installing new apps from Windows Store or obtaining system updates obviously don't work.
I also noticed Auto Play settings are all set to "choose a default", not sure if this default settings for an activated system. They can be changed however.
Activating it will just allow locked options to be enabled. And to ensure that you do have an original copy of windows 8.
Don't expect your life to be easy, though. Microsoft will try to encourage you to activate your copy of Windows 8.
