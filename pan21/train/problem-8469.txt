If GoDaddy does not provide archiving as a hosted service upgrade, you have limited options. Many other mail hosters do provide this service for an additional fee per mailbox. Typically, the company compliance officer(s) is given access to a web interface through which they can do discovery and review messages and typically there are some basic filters/reports built in. 
Many companies have legal obligations that require they keep a copy of messages sent and received by their employees. Because this is such a common request, pretty much every viable, business-class email platform has some form of archiving either built in or they provide the necessary hooks for third parties to add those features.
It sounds like you're looking for something less formal and more ad-hoc and that the employer doesn't have legal reasons for this access but is instead a control-hungry pig. Luckily for his employees, implementing something like this at the client level is tough. I can imagine some ways of doing it but without knowing a lot more about the customer (are they using GoDaddy's POP/IMAP hosting or their white label Exchange hosting?, how are the clients configured for outbound mail? etc), I can't give you any more info.
