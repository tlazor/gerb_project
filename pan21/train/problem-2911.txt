And adapters that catch fire (or simply melt down, with the possibility of fire or exposed wiring) should be reported to your national safety agency.
Yes, it's relatively "normal" for a charger to spark when plugging in.  Not all will do it, but many high-current chargers will.  You may also see a similar spark plugging in a desktop computer.
I've never totally figured out the reason for this phenomenon, but I suspect it's related to the high capacitance inside the charger or power supply.  This is the opposite of, eg, an electric motor, which is inductive and where you will see the spark on unplugging.
The cause of this spark is capacitor used to separate circuits in transformer part of charger. It is initially discharged and has "will" to charge as fast as possible - thus the initial "inrush current". IT IS SAFE AND NOT AVOIDABLE although if there is voltage spike at the same time you plug in the charger (low probability-may be caused by shutting down or unplugging device with high consumption at the same time somewhere else in same branch of electric distribution) it may break the condenser and potentially damage the charger.
You should be able to plug/unplug the charger in either order, or leave it plugged in while not connected to the laptop.  
My original Dell laptop charger did not have a grounding prong and it did not spark.   I recently replaced the original with a compatible replacement charger which has the third grounding prong and with this charger I do get a spark each time the plug is about to be plugged into the socket. But I've never had any performance problems using either type of charger.
