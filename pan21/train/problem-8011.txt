After connecting with the new cable, windows recognises the monitor is connected and the back light on the monitor powers on but the screen stays black. Thinking I had a dud cable I returned it for a new one, same issue. My next thought was that I had been a bit too ambitious with 5M so bought a 3M cable from another supplier, same issue.
I've been running this setup for 2+ years with no issues. Until I had to change my desk setup and move the monitor further from my tower. The DVI cable I have been using is a standard DVI-D Dual Link 1.2M, obviously 1.2M doesn't give you a lot of maneuvering room, so I bought a new 5M cable. 
I have a GTX 670 connected to a "Matrix Neo" 2560x1440 monitor see here for a background on the phenomenon that is the "A- 1440 Panels" with interesting names. The reason I mention the specific monitor is because they come with very little processing built in, no on screen menus only one input etc.
My next, next thought is to try a 2M cable, but cant find any information to suggest that 3M is in any way excessive. The only alternative that i can come up with is that I have had the bad luck to get 3 bad cables from 2 different companies (I don't have another DVI monitor I can test with).
