If you need to drill down into one of those top levels, to report allocation under the parent, simply add the sub directory to the original command. I can easily see elasticsearch is the culprit behind 18G of allocation within /var on my system:
@fpmurphy suggest the yum directory may be involved with your problem. To extrapolate on that, whenever you work with yum all the packages which are downloaded to update the system are retained under /var/cache/yum by default. You may want to check the contents of the file /etc/yum.conf and check for the keepcache setting. What you post suggests that keepcache has a value of 1.
If /var/cache/yum is indeed filling up, you may be able to runyum clean all to fix things for now. There is evidence this command may not work as advertised however so take heed. I would suggest allocating more space to /var if possible.  
First of all, the pipe on head -n10 is only going to print out the first 10 directory entries in /var. If you have more than 10 directories, they are not being reported on. Secondly, du -h is not quite the best tool to use here as it is reporting duplicated allocation because child directories are being reported on.
