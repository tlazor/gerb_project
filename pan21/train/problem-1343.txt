When I try to resolve the domain, I get random records, from 1 of the 4 dc's. So it could be that, when you try to authenticate against ldap on site BEZA, it actually uses a DC on BEOM - That's a bit of a red herring. Querying the domain name in DNS using something like nslookup or dig isn't the same as locating a domain controller against which to authenticate. Querying the domain name in DNS via nslookup or dig should return all Domain Controllers regardless of site. That's the normal and expected behavior. That DOES NOT mean that your clients or your applications are going to use a random DC to authenticate against.
Do you have your subnets created and associated with the appropriate site in Active Directory Sites and Services?
Domain Controllers will register site specific records in DNS when you have ADS&S configured correctly. When an AD client queries DNS for the location of a DC, a local DC will be returned based on the client subnet if those subnets have been defined in ADS&S. The client will then create "affinity" with that site so that subsequent logons use the DC's in that site. This applies to the Domain Controller locator process. How your applications behave may be a different matter altogether.
