The best method would be to do a complete clean install on the new box and transfer the existing database across. The simplest way to move the databases would be to detach them all of the original server and re-attach them to the new server. 
You could migrate the system to new hardware and then perform the OS upgrade but it's almost guaranteed you will have no end of trouble afterwards. I agree with the others - do a clean install. As you are changing hardware as well you can run the two in parallel until you are certain the new system is ready to go.
The change in hardware and the new environment is going to cause more headaches then what it is worth.
Backup Exec System Recovery (link) will let you image a server and restore it to different hardware. It strips the HAL from the image before restoring it, which might help the Windows 2000 server better adjust to the new hardware. You could try using that to move the Windows 2000 server to the new hardware (just remember to shutdown as many services as you can before you start the backup).
I agree on the clean install. But, how about doing the software upgrade first on the old hardware then do the migration to new hardware?
