If what you are trying to do is just font scaling, I don't think this can be done smoothly. For Chrome you can adjust the text size directly in Chrome without changing the zoom level. If you go to the Settings -> Advanced Settings, under Web Content you can change the text size. Windows doesn't allow you to change DPI settings or font scaling on a per-program basis. It is determined on a system basis (or user). Windows 7 allows you to scale the desktop to 125% and 150% but that doesn't always work well. There is also a custom DPI scaling setting that's not so easy to find. If you go to Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalization -> Display, then on the left side there is an option for "Set custom text size (DPI). This will allow you much more fine-grained control over the DPI settings. Although this may increase the Windows system font as well, you may have more like finding a sweet spot between your Skype and games font and Windows system fonts. I hope this helps. It's also extremely likely that since it's a game, it doesn't adhere to Windows system font settings. You may just need to play at a lower resolution, or get a larger monitor with a lower DPI count. 
If the given program's Settings can change the font, or its User Interface lets you zoom-in, you are in luck.
