TLSv1 could also be used in the second case (in place of the more specific versions), but this way, you ensure the order of preference.
The reason why you need to turn off spectacularly insecure protocols like SSLv2/3 is because of downgrade attacks; an intermediary can modify the SSL connection negotiation to force the use of a less secure protocol.  There's nothing you can do about that except to not support the older protocols, because you never get told that the other end supports a better one (because the malicious intermediary has removed that information).
is default, your rule of server specifies about ssl protocols is configured to support those out of the box:
The highest protocol version supported by both ends of the connection will be used.  So, by default, TLS v1.2 will be used.
See Mozilla's TLS config generator for an set of recommendations about your more general TLS setup. 
Unless you have a specific reason for believing otherwise, generally systems that support TLS would support TSLv1.2.
Is there a way to set this up to force the use of TLSv1.2, and if not supported by the client then to fall back to TLSv1.1 / TLSv1?
