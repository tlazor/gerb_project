I've used unetbootin  from windows to bootstrap installs before - assuming you have sufficient hard disk space and ram (i'd recommend using a minimal install disk) and preferably a wired internet connection. No cds or floppies required, but you will either be booting a disk image or using said disk image for a 'proper' install
I would guess you have a second computer available, and that is what you are using to access superuser?  Why not temporarily pull the DVD drive from it, and attach it to your old box.  Do the base install, and the return the drive.
Is the hard drive IDE? You can get devices that allow you can plug an IDE drive into and then plug it into a newer computer via USB. You could always try and get a hold of one of those and use the new computer as "proxy hardware" to install the OS on the HDD and then move it over to the old hardware once it's done.
I ran out of options and patience for this. I scraped the computer, saved the hard drive, RAM, floppy, and disk drive, and got rid of it. Even after trying to boot from a Ubuntu LiveCD, a Smart Boot Manager floppy, and a DSL CD, nothing has worked. Niether has the proposed solution of unetbootn. Sometimes hardware is too old to easily salvage. I now have a different old computer that runs Linux like a charm (its an old Dell). The one I scraped was Sony, so that might have something to do with hardware support. But I also have an old Sony VAIO that runs Ubuntu perfectly (Xubuntu 10.04). Gotta love hardware computability with Linux.
Sorry if I'm misinterpreting your post here, but if the old computer only has a CD-ROM drive, have you tried buying some CDs to make a liveCD? Are you in a time crunch and can't make one?
