Unidirectional ethernet is actually something else entirely. You are asking about full-duplex ethernet vs. half-duplex ethernet.
Most modern ethernet ports support auto-detection for things like speed and duplex, and will negotiate the fastest speed, and full duplex (if available). Negotiation is optional in 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, but mandatory in 1000BASE-T.
The reason you shouldn't mess with the speed and duplex setting has to do with the default duplex settings for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. Both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX have a default of half duplex. When on side of a link is set to fixed settings, negotiation is disabled, and the other side can detect (not negotiate) the speed, but the duplex will be set at the default, half-duplex rate. This results in one side set to full duplex, and the other side at half duplex. This causes serious problems with the link, slowing the transfer rate to a crawl.
Alternatively, you can set fixed speed and duplex on a port, but this is not recommended, and, since auto-negotiation is a requirement for 1000BASE-T, some vendors have opted to remove the ability to fix settings for that speed.
This isn't a problem for 1000BASE-T since the default duplex is full. In fact, when the standard for 1000BASE-T was debated, there was a large contingent of engineers who wanted to completely eliminate half duplex from the standard. Unfortunately, half duplex was left in, but the standard for 10GBASE-T finally eliminated the half-duplex option.
