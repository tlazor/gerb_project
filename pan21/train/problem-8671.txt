I have 10 scsi drives which are used. How do I test them to ensure they are working correctly? Some have red stickers presumably indicating they are faulty. The server I have access to is an IBM with ServeRAID 7k controller.
The server has a serveraid support CD for configuring the raid controller, but not any specific diagnostics software. Can I run diagnostics for the drives from Windows Server 2008 which is installed on one of the servers?
The other tool to use is sg_senddiag which can utilize SEND DIAGNOSTICS commands to tell the drive to test itself and then to monitor the test state with sg_logs again (forgot the page number for test results, use page 0 to find the page number).
I'm only familiar with the Unix world tools, you can use sgtools and mostly sg_logs to peek at the disk status. You can see different pages where the most important is page 0x2f which shows "Informational Exceptions", esssentially SMART. If that page shows asc/ascq of 0x0 than the disks don't think they are dead. Beyond that you'll need to have better understanding of disks to make a decision.
