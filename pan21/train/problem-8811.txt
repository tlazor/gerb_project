The 1st option does not work for me. Latex always adds extra padding and margin to the image, so the image is not readable anymore.
Download one of the PDF printer drivers, such as Nitro or PrimoPDF, and just open your image in Photoshop and print it with the PDF driver. We use these a lot to make excellent quality, small PDFs to email to customers.
I have a JPG file, scanned image of a document. It is a 2-page document and I united them in Photoshop. Now the JPG file is only 500KB, and the image quality is good. The JPG file's dimensions are 2481x5152 pixels
But the application form I'm uploading this document requires a *.PDF file format. I can think of two ways here : 
In output tab, I choose image quality as Minimum, so that dimensions and resolution are preserved but the file size is nearly as the JPG size.
Does somebody know a good setting in this menu, that will produce a PDF file less than 5MB, and with good quality?
The second option, I tried, but photoshop Extracts a 40MB file, or a 130KB file (Smallest File Size in the PDF settings), but then the image in the PDF is not readable anymore.
