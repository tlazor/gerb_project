Check anything you (or anyone in the household) knowingly installed in the last two weeks. Check antivirus status to make sure something else didn't install itself in the last two weeks. Sign up for any new services/"features" on any sort of social media? etc...
Someone turned on or installed something that "checks in" every minute, I'd guess. What, exactly, I don't know - email, horrid crudwear (weather-checkers, various spybots, etc.)
I have been having lag issues when I play online games (Mostly League of Legends). I've been suffering from lag that occurs exactly every 60 seconds and it lasts 1-3 seconds. I called my ISP and they cant find the issue on their end.  We use a wireless broadband service due to the fact we live out in the country. They are usually very good about finding and fixing problems that occur. I am thinking it may be a router issue, but I am not sure. What could cause this and how can I fix it? I am wired in with an Ethernet cable and everyone on in the household gets this lag. It just started happening one day and its been going on for about two weeks. My router is an Asus N65R. I am not the best at problem solving the computers, but I can navigate through one pretty well with the right instructions. Thanks in advance and let me know what more information you need.
Check if it happens on each computer with all the other computers turned off, to see if you can isolate it to a particular computer.
