Come up with scenarios that you would have to deal with in terms of acceptable use on the computer systems and then talk to your boss about it; unless you have the authority to fire someone you should work on the language of the policies with other heads-of-departments or supervisors. If you have a legal department you will want it run through them as well to make sure you're not stepping on legal issues involving privacy or termination in your area.
Ideally your business already has some employee handbooks or materials that employees have to be aware of and prop their desks up with, so there could be some idea of a template in there to work from for you.
You've already received some great advice -- a few thoughts specific to the medical field (not all IT-related, but if you're storing patient data electronically there is a LOT of bleed-over):
You should work with your boss/HR people to have a series of written policies, adopted by the supervisors, that outline how various issues are handled and what is expected of employees. These can vary depending on the business, but basically you would have documents that specify what is and isn't allowed on your network and computer systems and what the followup (how remediation is handled, what can lead to termination, etc.) actions are. Then your employees are given the material as part of an employee handbook or memo, possibly to sign and keep on file.
