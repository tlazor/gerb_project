I'm assuming it's a RAID array because it's still working. If you're getting that error now, unfortunately I don't think it will go away when you swap the disk. If the RAID controller can't recreate the block from parity data (I'm assuming that's the cause of the corruption), then it won't be able to write it to your new disk either.
I would consider that database to be suspect and the only way you can really be 100% certain it doesn't have any underlying and unnoticed corruption is to fix the array (probably blow it away and start again), restore from yesterday's backup and roll forward the transaction logs, which are on a totally separate array.... right?
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Others might give you some solutions that will get you by for a bit, but personally I wouldn't trust that database now. Holocryptic's solution of eseutil might work, and if it does, again I wouldn't trust a database that has been eseutil'd and would move mailboxes off that store rather quickly if you do get it into a mountable state.
