Patrick is basically correct, but there are tools you can use to try to recover your data yourself. Depending on how you partitioned your disk, TestDisk may be able to recover some of your partitions, although they may have some damage. The PhotoRec utility, or similar Windows-only tools, are more likely to be able to recover a subset of your files. In both cases, the fact that you've re-installed the OS means that the chances of your recovering all your files is minuscule, even if you hand the disk over to a specialized and pricey shop.
If your data are at all important, it's better to hand the disk over to an expert than to try to do it yourself. The low-level recovery tools I've just suggested can be tricky to use. You can easily make matters worse or simply fail to recover data if you're not an expert.
To maximize your chances of success, power off the computer immediately. (Don't even use the shutdown option; just pull the plug.) Any continued use of the computer runs the risk of overwriting more of the data you want to recover. Also, this type of operation is inherently risky, so you should have a complete low-level backup of your disk before you begin. This means you'll need a spare disk that's at least as large as the one you want to recover.
