Yes this is possible. All you need to do is follow the same advice you were for a pod specification, but rather than applying it to a YAML file for pods, you apply it to a YAML file for a deployment. 
You need to add the 'hostAliases' section in the deployments 'template: spec' field which allows you to configure the template for the pod/containers. So to demonstrate this visually, here is the YAML for a deployment I am running in my project that I can edit by running the command I mentioned above:
If I want to add 'hostAliases' to the pods within this deployment, I need to add this information to the pod template spec section as demonstrated below (notice it is in line with 'containers' (***important- it's worth noting that there are two 'spec' sections within my file- I don't want to add it to the first spec section, but rather the template spec section which defines the pod template):
For example, if you are already running a deployment you can edit the current deployment by issuing the following command.
