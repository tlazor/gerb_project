If you're planning to create realistic looking portraits you'll have to have pretty solid art skills and they abviously require a lot of work. The fastest way to get there would probably be: Downloading an existing 3d model and modify it, or paint over a photo.
It's hard to give you an advice since you didn't tell us anything about the art-style you're going for.
Of course this is going to look out of place if your other game-art is completely different. IMHO the key is consistency in your art-style. Keep things simple. It's going to look good, if you can keep the same level of simplicity and art-style throughout your game. And if you're not happy with what you can do, ask somebody who has got the talent... better waste your time on things you're good at ;-)
Luckily, we only need some very basic shapes to recognize something as a human face. You could use that to your advantage (and also give your game an unique look). Take Nintendos Mii as an example. There are only a few basic elements available to create portraits from, yet you can create almost every portrait and expression you want.
