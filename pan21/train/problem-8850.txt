avast! Professional Edition has some nice features like creating a preconfigured installation, background scanning (doesn't hog the hard drive while the computer is under load) and can be configured to be user-friendly in not dropping millions of notifications on him. There are some server products avast! authors offer, like avast! Distributed Network Manager.
At my side IT job I only used the client Professional Edition, without the management server or DNM and it worked very well.
I always use Malwarebytes for spot removal since it just seems to remove what Symantec often can't - has anyone tried the pro version?  The site doesn't list any centralized management features...
AVG professional. In my experience AVG does a good job is keeping their definitions up to date and does a thorough job.
We use NOD32. The main reason for choosing it was because it was less of a resource-hog than the others.
One of the features i quite like about the site editions is the push functionality, it works quite well as long as there isn't a firewall in its way and easy to keep organized.
