Just randomly throughout the day my computer will just go to the desktop. I could be in a full screen game and it will just immediately alt tab and present the desktop. Or I could be watching a movie and this happens.
PS: I doubt it's a virus because I never download illegal software and pretty much only browse Reddit and Stackexchange and play games. If it was a virus it would be a pretty lame one.. Hah..
My FireFox add-ons: Adblock Plus, Download Statusbar, Firebug, FirePHP, lazarus form recovery, tree-style-tabs, yslow.
Sometimes it happens once every three hours and other times (just today actually) it did it twice in the span of 30 seconds.
Whew. Okay. That was a lot of information. If someone could diagnose this I would be most grateful for this has been around with me for years.. Thanks for reading!
I am positive I am not pressing a hotkey because I launched a game, sat idle, and noticed it alt tab while cleaning up around my room after about 20 minutes.
As for user processes I have running: VCDDaemon (context menu for virtual clone drive), razerhid (mouse), OSD, taskhost, dmw (desktop window manager), anyfullscreengame, audiorepeater, netsession_win, explorer, razerofa, tsvncache, firefox, plugin-container, and EKIJ5000MUI (printer).
I doubt FireFox is causing the issue but I figured I'd include it anyway because it is the only application I have running when it happens.
I'm not sure when this began, how it happens, or why it happens, but it is quite bothersome and apparently random.
