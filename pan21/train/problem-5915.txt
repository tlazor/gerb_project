Bottom line, for collaborative work, it is generally necessary for all parties to use compatible tools that work nearly identically with the same format.  That or you need to choose a limited feature set that will interconvert with minimal fuss.
I often share documents with colleagues. I use LibreOffice (and OpenOffice). But my colleagues use Microsoft Office. My documents always look differently when opened in MS Office (.doc and .odt format). Converting them to pdf is not an option as the documents are also edited by my colleagues. Online office software like Google Docs is not an option, either. 
It is a cloud solution and, since you will need to be doing your work in a browser, not necessarily as convenient as being able to work on the desktop.  You can also try uploading ODF documents into Skydrive for sharing with your colleagues that way.  This involves some level of conversion at the Skydrive end, especially if someone uses Microsoft Office to edit them on their desk top.  
You can try learning how to use both Word and Writer and start using proper formating for your documents, Styles, tab-stops, page breaks, sections...
So based on your experience, is there a document format that will make my file look more similar in both software?
You might consider using Microsoft Skydrive and working within the feature limitations of the Skydrive implementations for Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, https://skydrive.live.com.  You'll be able to control who else can access the Skydrive documents and also control whether it is read-only or editable.
