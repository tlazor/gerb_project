Disabled secure boot and UEFI mode and in legacy mode select first bootable device USB device or DVD and restart the system. Now you can install windows easily. 
1: The Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool is not compatible with USB 3.0. To create a USB stick that is compatible with USB 3.0 using the native boot experience of the Windows 10 Technical Preview media (or Windows 8/Windows 8.1), use DiskPart to format the USB stick and set the partition to active, then copy all of the files from inside the ISO to the USB stick.
2: UEFI (CSM disabled) requires the USB stick to be formatted FAT32. If your stick is formatted NTFS, it would explain the behavior you have described.
However, when I try booting in CSM boot mode, the USB boots just fine. I tried installing Windows 10 in CSM then setting the boot mode back to UEFI mode, but I can't. I'm trying to dual-boot Windows 10 with Windows 8.1 (already installed) and I'm currently using GPT, so I need to format the drive to MBR but I don't want to go through that trouble.
I have formatted the USB (tried MBR and GPT - same result), and restored the ISO using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. When I try booting the USB, the laptop simply ignores it and continues booting Windows. I have tried changing the boot order, or manually selecting the USB with no positive result. It seems like it's not even recognizing it (it's not showing the USB's name in the boot menu).
Many of the hurdles that you might face when making a Windows installation USB drive are overcome with the right tool.  The most versatile one at the moment is Easy2Boot.  By following one of the tutorials out there, you can keep your USB drive (even large USB hard drives) formatted as NTFS, rather than limiting your options with FAT32.  Even UEFI is possible.  In my case, I have an NTFS-formatted USB 3.0 stick that I use to boot multiple installation ISOs in UEFI mode, and some ISOs are larger than 4 GB, which isn't possible with FAT32 formatting.
