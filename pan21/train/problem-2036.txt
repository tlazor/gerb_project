Is there a way to get to the files that were backup under c:\windows.old\user\? I am thinking that because the helpdesk created a domain account and then added the machine to company domain those files still exists somewhere on the machine under different account.
Today when i tried to navigate to c:\windows.old\user\ I cannot find any files under desktop, documents, favorites.. etc. folders.
I recently upgraded my machine to Windows 10. I had windows 8. The upgrade did not go well so I had to reinstall Windows 10 on my machine. It was a clean install. I had opted to wiping out all the app and user settings. Luckily, when windows 10 was installed, it back all my old files under c:\windows.old\user\ folder. After I installed Windows 10, my account was created as a local account for that machine and I saw all the files existed under my older profile under c:\windows.old\user\
Because it is a work machine, after everything was setup, the helpdesk people created a domain account and changed the default machine and added that machine to company's domain.
