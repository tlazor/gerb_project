A userform with fields will collect strings with the fullpath to the workbooks, and perhaps some dropdown lists with possible months and years for
So I often declare a Type whose elements are all the workbooks I'm going to need, which will be the parameter I'll be passing around the processes. In this case, like this (variable names have been deliberately changed to hide the privacy of the actual report I'm making here):
I have this very recurrent pattern at my VBA macros, where I have to ask the user to give me certain information that will be necessary for the processes to come. Most often for example, I need him to give me some workbooks and maybe a date.
As I've tried, the UI will only verify that the four files have been selected on the OK button, and if so, assign the workbook references to the struct and then hide himself; so far this is the "only" interaction of the UI with the Data, which I've tried to separate as much as I can. But here is where I see all this UI Architectural Patterns appearing on my Stack Overflow reseach and I'm not sure of the approach to take.
