My internet through my internal wifi (intel wireless-n 1030) on my laptop slowed down 2-3 weeks ago. I used to download 2 MB/s. Now it is 20KB/s and barely reaches 150KB/s. Youtube buffers sometimes at 144p. I used to watch 1080P. It was really wierd because my other devices were fast. I tried changing my MAC address (MadMAC) to check if my ISP is slowing my connection to no avail. I changed the router's channel to a unique one to no avail. I bought a cheap usb WIFI. And voila 2 MB/s speed on the external.
If you downgraded your driver to your WiFi Card, the external one is working and nothing changed as the speed decrease happened, maybe your card is damaged. 
I tested wifi speed through my nexus 5's hotspot (4G). I got the same speed on both my internal wifi and external wifi at 500 KB/s. So I can safely eliminate that the hardware is damaged. 
Sounds to me like the problem isn't with your ISP, if an external card is working at the nominal speeds I doubt it could be them. If they were going to throttle your connection, it would affect all of your devices.
My question: Is it possible that my ISP can slow my connection even when I am using different MAC address, different ip address, and different wifi display name?
If it is poor in a location where the USB adapter is strong, it may be the antenna which is damaged. They usually run up around the screen bezel, so they are easy to damage with a knock.
