So find out how the resolution of the hostname to its IP address worked in first place (with dhcp) and continue to look on the machine that is mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf or the answering entity in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
Your router is probably acting as a DNS server for the local network handing out information about hosts that received an address via DHCP.  Or to put it differently, when a DHCP request is handled out, the router dynamically updates the local DNS database.  DNSMasq, is a common DHCP+DNS server on routers that does this.  
If possible you should set a DHCP reservation in your router, not set a static address.  If that isn't an option, then you simply are going to need to update your hosts files on all your machines, or run a local DNS server.
Also, the file /etc/nsswitch.conf defines in which order your hosts file, mdns, DNS and such are tried. It's the line beginning with "hosts".
By setting a static address, you are basically robbing your router of the information it needs to respond to DNS queries about your host.
This is not about DHCP but most probably about DNS. You have to have an address in /etc/resolv.conf where the hostname of your server is known so the resolution can work. I think the DHCP offer inserted something here that is missing (or different) when you are assigning the static ip.
