In a Windows VM, I would run Microsoft Security Essentials as the virus program.   The reason is obvious: most people "playing" with a non-production VM wouldn't afford the license for any sort of costly anti-virus solution.
If it's Windows it should have antivirus protection, regardless of whether it's a VM or a physical machine. Your comments regarding performance tells me 2 things.
1 word.  YES.   Using something like the "xp-mode" in windows 7... or most other desktop-based VMs will use a NAT for sharing the network adapter... and makes that machine vulnerable to anything your desktop machine doesn't pick up.  If it isn't NAT'ed... then it has a dedicated IP... and is fully vulnerable... and even more likely to pick up a nasty bug.  The only time I would say go ahead without some AV... is if you were running without any form of network access at all.  Even then... you could still inadvertently transfer something over (through some sort of shared directory setup... or through shared drives)
