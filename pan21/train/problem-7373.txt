But given that you need this on a laptop, it's more complicated. You could try to find something like Microtech 1M USB To SCSI Converter DB25F/USB but they are extremely expensive compared to a SCSI PCI card you can get from old recycled PCs/servers.
It's going to be far easier if you can get a rescue OS booted up on that system and copy the files from a running live Linux CD or similar.  Linux has great support for older SCSI hardware so it should recognize the drive, assuming no physical issue with the controller or drive itself.
But you will also need a SCSI drive enclosure, to power the drive, as only the hotswappable server variant of SCSI provided power over the SCSI connection itself.
And if there was such an adapter, would I be able to access the HDD? I mean in terms of drivers etc. will a modern laptop (preferably Ubuntu) be able to communicate with it?
USB to SCSI adapters do exist.  Search "IOMEGA JAZ SCSI USB ADAPTER cable -SCSI USBA converter 04089800" as an example.  These look expensive, and they may only work with Iomega hardware though.  There are others if you search hard enough.
My girlfriend has an old computer that she didn't use for MANY years. It has some important pictures on its hard drive, so I tried to access that data. The HDD is an old Seagate ST34520W with a 68pin SCSI. What are my options? I didn't finds any SCSI to USB or to SATA converter/adapter...
You connect it to a PCI slot, connect the SCSI drive to the card. Such cards have a SCSI interface. They also support booting from them.
