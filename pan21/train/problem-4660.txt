This blog post (How I Recovered my Firefox Tab Groups) describes a way to extract them from sessionstore.js, using the linux commandline and Python.
That said, I just hope that I didn't miss out on any tabs. (If I can't tell the difference maybe it doesn't matter all that much... :P) I have also backed up my sessionstore files, and will take my time to process them to verify that I have indeed recovered all my tabs. 
Additionally, you can use an addon like Conex to import the TabGroups backup file, converting tabs to Container Tabs.
(PS I know Stackexchange prefers an answer on the page rather than a simple link, but it didn't feel right to copy & paste that person's work from their blog on here)
PS: All credit to @trrocket, but  I thought it was was worth putting this as an answer instead of having someone panic on looking at the other answer, without reading the comments. +1 to @trrocket :-)
If you're freaking out about losing your tabs, and simply want quick assurance that they're not gone forever, the easiest thing is to install the Tree-Style Tabs extension, as suggested by @trrocket. I can verify that after installing it, I was able to find the "lost" tabs in the sidebar. 
This Quantum-compatible addon offers similar functionality and will magically find all those missing tabs from your old Groups. I can't speak for how well it works as a replacement as I've only just downloaded it myself, for this very reason, but worst case scenario you can get the tabs back, bookmark them and get rid of Conex, so you've at least got those tabs backed up wile you work out how to cope without Groups.
