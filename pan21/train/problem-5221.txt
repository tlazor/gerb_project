Unlike a version control system like Mercurial, rsync won't keep history or backups, so it is very easy to accidentally delete files (or very hard, depending on your point of view - a sync might just download your deleted files again.)
For the first sync it will explain what is going on, then each time you run the same command it will show you changes and sometimes conflicts. If you want it in cron, set up passwordless ssh authentication and run with the options "-batch -silent".
There is lots to learn about unison, and the configuration file format is a little weird. But I highly recommend it, as it really replaces dropbox and similiar services. I synchronize terabytes between lots of machines and it works great. The 2.27.57 version is available on most platforms (linux, windows, osx).
I use Unison for all such synchronization, when I feel a DVCS would be overkill. Essentially it works like an intelligent two-way rsync of two folders, often through ssh. A simple example:
These options can also go in a configuration file. If you create "/home/pi/.unison/myserver.prf" you can then run "unison myserver". Check out the online manual and for a good primer "Setting up unison for your mom".
A quick solution would be to use rsync, which makes a local directory look identical to a remote one.  Unlike DropBox, you would just have to perform the sync operation manually when you wanted things up to date.
