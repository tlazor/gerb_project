Just recreate your connections from within PuTTY instead. It will almost certainly be easier, less error-prone, and less risky than trying to overwrite the registry. Even if you do manage to import the old registry file, there is no telling what odd problems might crop up in the future due to unexpected or unsupported registry values.
I would expect that upgrading to Windows 10 made numerous modifications to the registry. Windows 10 might also use a different on-disk file format that Windows 8.1 simply doesn't understand. (Microsoft regularly make either superficial or actual changes to internal file formats between versions. Compare SQL Server, where you can't even take a backup from a more recent version and restore it onto an older version of the same product. Upgrading is a one-way path.)
Blindly overwriting HKLM in particular with a copy from a newer version of Windows is bound to cause issues. Remember that many of the values stored in the registry are not bound by any contract to have particular meanings, and the meaning of different values can change even with a simple update, let alone a whole operating system upgrade to a new release.
