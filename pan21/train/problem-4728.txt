If you downloaded all these files, they are most likely compressed - particularly if they end in .gz, .tgz, .zip, .deb, .gif, .jpg, .png.   Go out and purchase an external drive and move the data onto it.
It's probably because there's this one folder I have with a bunch of files I downloaded from the Internet. I still need them, and I still need disk space too.
Without knowing the file contents, its hard to advise a strategy to compress them - and its unlikely to do much any way.  7zip most likely offers the tightest compression, but I'd be very surprised if its worth the cost in time and CPU.
There is 1 exception I can think of - if there are lots and lots of tiny files, compressing them all into a single file can save significant space because of unused space at the end of each block - this doesn't seem to meet your objectivie though.
Another approach would be to look at your drive as a whole - it may be that your home directory is full, but other parts of the system are on different partitions - in which case you can make changes to where the data is stored to free up space - either by creating symlinks, a union-fs type solution or something else - but we would need to know your disk setup to advise this.
