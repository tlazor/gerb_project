Another thing to watch for is partitions still reside on the same physical disk (if you only have one disk, that is) so you don't have any protection from disk failure.
It is purely personal choice. If the partition fills up and you need to install or update software then you may need to resize the partition. Be careful, however, as resizing a partition can lead to data loss.
For convenience it is much easier to use a single partition spanning the entire disk - so you don't have to worry about moving/resizing partitions, however, you don't have the separation between an OS partition and a separate "data" partition - in case you have to re-install your OS, for example. With two partitions you can keep your data on one partition, re-install the OS that's on the other partition and your personal data will be fine.
If "I" were doing it I'd use one large partition (the full disk) and make sure I've got a regular backup of my most important files (cloud storage, USB, NAS etc.) - but that's an opinion based answer so you must make a decision that works for you.
