The credentials can be stored in the user accounts, or they can be stored in a system-wide location so the machine can be on the network even when no user is logged in (like for remote management and overnight backups). 
PEAP has options for what kind of login credentials it uses. It can use usernames and passwords or it can use public key certificates and their matching private keys.
If the private key you need was marked as non-exportable when it was installed, Microsoft's tools won't let you export it. However, there are third party tools that can help you extract non-exportable private keys out of the certificate store, if you have the right level of access to the PC. IIRC, you need to know the local admin password. 
You can see what public key certificates are installed by using certmgr.mmc, which is the Certificate Manager snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console. You can use that tool to export certificates, and, in some cases, also export their matching private keys, which are a necessary part of the login credentials. You can't use a cert to auth to a network if you don't have the private key that goes with it.
