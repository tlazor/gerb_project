It is not clear exactly what you mean by having your drive split up, but I don't think it could have any benefits.  One thing to note though, is if you use storage vmotion to move the files, all files will be migrated at the same time to a single datastore.
It's also possible to do this in VMware using Extents which is probably what is going on here - these are used to combine multiple LUNS into a single VMware VMFS datastore. It would be a standard practice but it's not necessarily a bad idea. The same caution applies to this as for the earlier example - if the two LUNs differ significantly in their performance then there might be performance variances across the datastore (and within your D-Drive) that are undesirable. There is also a slightly elevated failure risk - if either LUN fails then you lose the whole lot but if all the storage comes from the same SAN then that's not particularly serious. 
Another way that I can think of that might cause this is if the D drive had another drive mounted as a folder on the D drive.  You could verify this by looking at the settings of the Vm and see if there are 3 drives listed.
SAN backed storage can combine space from separate RAID sets in a number of ways. It's possible to extend a LUN by either concatenating or striping it with capacity from another LUN that is not in the same RAID set. The SAN abstracts this so that your host system just sees a bigger block storage device. It's not all that unusual, but if done poorly (say by simply concatenating capacity from two LUNs with very different performance characteristics) it might cause undesirable performance variances from the host OS perspective.
