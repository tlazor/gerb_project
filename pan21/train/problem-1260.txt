I already checked the tasklist and Apache is really not running. But there is no process listening to port 80 still even if the IIS restarts successfully. Any ideas how to fix this?
I have installed Oracle 9i HTTP Server together with the database. After restarting the PC, even though i restarted the IIS and stopped the Oracle HTTP Server. When I go to http://localhost/ The starting page is already the Oracle HTTP Server index page. Also when I look at the port that inetinfo.exe is listening to, it no longer listens to port 80 and the SSL port 443, even if i restart the IIS and World Wide Web Publishing service. 
Then check what port and IP IIS is listening on. if memory serves, you can see that by right-clicking on the default web site node in IIS manager and check the properties.
I think I already know the cause. I looked at the the remaining services installed by Oracle 9i. [OracleOraHome90Agent, OracleOraHome90TNSListener, OracleServiceORCL] I started stopping them one by one and restarting IIS after each service is stopped. The IIS finally worked when I stopped the OracleServiceORCL service. I guess the database needs to be stopped too. Which is weird, in my initial guess I should only stop the OracleOraHome90HTTPServer service.
