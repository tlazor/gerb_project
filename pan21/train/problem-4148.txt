Although that link is specific to the Raspberry Pi, it should work on Ubuntu machines the same way.  For other Linux distros that don't use apt-get, just adjust apt-get to your appropriate package manager - e.g. yum for Fedora and CentOS)
From there it automatically begins using your computer's hostname plus the .local extension as it's domain name.  So if your machine's hostname is mediaserver, then you can access it on the network by typing mediaserver.local into the URL bar of any machine that has Bonjour/Avahi on it (i.e. all Macs, plus Windows machines with iTunes installed).
Local name resolution is a simple feature and it's been part of most routers that I used. It's also implemented in DD-WRT firmware. Netgear doesn't care for this feature that is constantly requested.
So, the answer that is much simpler than the others posted here - avoid the trouble and change your Netgerat router to something that supports local name resolution. Or, if that's not an option, and you feel the strength and got the time, flash DD-WRT on it.
I found the Avahi daemon to be the easiest way to do this.  Note: if you are using Windows machines to connect to the .local domain, you need to make sure those machines have either iTunes or another Bonjour client installed on them.
