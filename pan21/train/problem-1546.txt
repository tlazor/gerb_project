P.S. Since KB article states that there is hot-fix available, you can just call Microsoft support, give them KB article number, and they will give you hot-fix. This would probably be least painful solution.
I've had the same issue with an MP3 player. The solution was the same, also (change the device to MSC).
I have a Canon Digital Ixus 990IS. The PC (running Windows XP SP2) sees the camera fine. I can copy images and movies.
You can try FileSaver. Advantage of this program is that it copies data in stages. Each stage will only copy parts that haven't succeeded in previous one.
However, this is a setting that is set on the device, not your computer. If your device doesn't have this setting, you are forced to use other suggestions such as use a card reader to mount it as a drive, etc.
However a large movie (900mb) fails with no message. This MS KB article describes the problem in detail. I face "Symptom #2" (as they call it).
Most of file copiers will copy same file each time from start, they will stop at same place each time.
