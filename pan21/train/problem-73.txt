Now we introduce this harmonic onto our medium with a restriction of 3000 Hz (ordinary telephone line) and we want to find the highest number of this harmonic we can pass on this medium. We have already found that the first harmonic for this example requires 10 Hz, so the highest number of harmonics we can pass on this medium is 300 (3000 Hz/10 Hz). Or to follow the math as it is laid out in the book, 3000/(80/8) or 24,000/80, which both give us the same result.
This seems pretty straightforward to me, and I am not sure where your confusion is coming from at this point. Perhaps it's the math and if we made the example a bit more concrete you might pick up on this?
To change it up, let's now change b to 10 bps. This gives us a first harmonic of 1.25 Hz, and the highest harmonic on the medium of 2400.
Let's set b to 80, or 80 bit/sec. This means that the time it takes to send 8 bits one bit at a time is 1/10 second (8/b sec). Or to put this into terms of frequency, this harmonic requires 10 Hz (b/8 Hz).
