The question you've posted is fairly generic in nature and I would recommend you do some research yourself on certain components before asking a question - specifics are better.
You will do what people describe as light-work, which describes web browsing/emails/general usage. I can think of only one intensive operation: code compilation, which usually only takes long with large projects.
You want, in general, a fast CPU (Multi-core is best, but don't go crazy - quad core is more than enough). This defines how fast your computer can run. Then, you want a good amount of RAM - this can get expensive, but from experience I would say that 8 to 16 gigabytes would sort you just fine for now and 5+ years (RAM defines how many programs can run simultaneously, eg chrome tabs, music players, etc).
You don't want to splash on a graphics card at all - you won't be needing it! You can get by using integrated graphics from the CPU, or if you need one, any cheap GPU should do you fine, provided it can support resolutions of upto 1080p or so. A hard drive may be useful for long term storage, but thats beyond the scope of the answer.
Storage isn't of the essence, and something like 128GB (or even 64GB potentially) would do you fine. I recommend an SSD - it would seriously speed up your computer in terms of loading.
