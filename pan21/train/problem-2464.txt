Don't do that. A non-administrative user by default is able to join several computers to the domain (the specific number of computers a non-administrative user can join depends on how the domain administrator has configured active directory)
So if you are "trying out two different configurations" then create a different VM for each configuration you need to try. You will need to give them different machine names, but realistically speaking there is no reason that using different machine names would keep you from testing. If you need to test how group policy applies to different configurations then simply give each VM its own machine name and place them in their own OU in AD and then link the GPO to that OU.
Bottom line is you can't have two machines with the same name joined to the same domain. I strongly encourage you to look at using visualization software to test build environments.
Have you through about building two VMs using virtualization software (e.g. VirtualBox) and configuring the network adapters as NAT so both VMs would use appear to the network to be using your host's static IP address?
Again, please keep in mind the IP address has nothing to do with the trust violation. Having two computers with the same name joined to the same domain does.
