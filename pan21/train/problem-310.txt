Most of the time, PC starts running slow by lots of reasons. Corrupt registry, unnecessary applications, as well as too many start-up items would be the major reasons contributing to this problem. Many PC users simply utilize PC yet never consider how to maintain and optimize PC performance. I would suggest you to download any reliable program to fix registry, to manage unnecessary applications & start-up items like am using Reginout since 2011. Many programs are available in market which can perform these steps, but don't believe on free products. Now its up to you. :-)
Just use CCleaner it will asks which files have to be deleted which are not.And also fix and clean your registry.
Have you significantly reduced the amount of available disk space ( = Have you added a few Gigas of data on your hard drives ) ?
Since you know more or less "when it started", you can try to see what changed since that moment to find the culprit (which might be the result of one of your direct action on your system).
Just like @werner-henze noted, the best question to ask yourself might not be "why my computer hangs" but "when my computer hangs". 
Have you been doing something different (using a new program that is memory-intensive, running something in the background) that you didn't before? 
Go to the Processes tab, then click view from the menu and select Columns.  tick the I/O Read and Write boxes, you might find that something is using the had drive, possibly a virus scanner.
