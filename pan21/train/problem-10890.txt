does iperf automatically discard packets that arrive out of sequence with UDP? You might be looking at a little bit of jitter on the connection.
Well, with TCP there are mechanisms to maximize the utilization of one flow, with UDP there aren't. So each application have to create their own mechanisms, so probably each application use a different approach to do that. Probably, Iperf will allow more packets lost because is trying to reach the maximum available bandwidth with out care about if the information is received or not. The other application probably will try to not lost many packets, and will reduce the packet rate to the available throughput in the connection.
Have you used tcpdump to check the packet loss when using iPerf to make sure the packet loss you calculate with tcpdump matches iperf?
I tested a line for its link quality with iperf. The measured speed (UDP port 9005) was 96Mbps, which is fine, because both servers are connected with 100Mbps to the internet. On the other hand the datagram loss rate was shown to be 3.3-3.7%, which I found a little too much. Using a high-speed transfer protocol I recorded the packets on both sides with tcpdump. Than I calculated the packet loss - average 0.25%. Have anyone an explanation, where this big difference may be coming from? What is an acceptable packet loss in your opinion?
