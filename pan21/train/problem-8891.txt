I recommend to glue some tape on the cutting zones, not only to mark the cutting places, but also to helps to avoid breaking the plastic when cutting.
There are a range of pre-made RasPi cases on the market, as covered in This article. I bought a clear one from element14 a while back but they have since gone up in price, adafruit also stocks a range of RasPi accessories but if you look around you can probably find a local distributor close to where you are.
Got any LEGO bricks laying around?  Plenty of people are using them for building Pi cases.  And then you can add room for drives, usb devices, etc. And there is no need for an adapter, just place the Pi up against the edge of your case and leave an opening for the cable.
Well, this IS my case, but I think higuita has an excellent idea to use tape to protect the edges of the plastic when cutting holes in the audio cassette case. I used a Dremel tool and it did not take a lot of time or skill. Just a willingness to sacrifice a Peter Frampton cassette.
Its a simple case, but easy to build and manage. grab a transparent cassette box and you have a pretty case for free!
