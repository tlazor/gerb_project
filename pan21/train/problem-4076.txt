more circumstantial evidence for this, more recently (~2010) it was shown the phase transition shows up for lower bounds on monotone circuits for clique-detection on random graphs.
expert researchers in this area basically assert that phase transitions are a universal feature of NP complete problems although this has yet to be formulated/ proven rigorously and it is not yet widely regarded/ disseminated in the larger field (it emanates more from an empirical-oriented branch of study). its nearly an open conjecture. there is strong evidence. there are no plausible candidates for non phase-transition NP complete problems. here are two refs that support this pov:
Here is a table of coloring results, that I will be submitting to SAT17.  Note that 3 coloring of 6 regular graphs is impossible except for a few examples.  Likewise 4 coloring of tenth degree graphs...  C3D5N180 graphs are mildly difficult.  The C4D9 Golden Point is only tentatively at C4D9N180;  C4D9 graphs are the hardest 4cnfs by size that I have encountered, so C4D9 qualifies as a "Hard Spot".  The C5D16 Golden point is conjectured to exist, but would be in the hard spot region from 5 coloring to 6 coloring.
here is a rough sketch of the truth of the assertion. it has to do with P contained in NP complete. an NP complete problem/ language must have instances that are solvable in P time and others that are solvable in exponential (or at least superpolynomial-) time if P≠NP. but there must always be some way to "group" the P instances from the "non-P" instances. therefore there must also always be some "transition criteria" between the P and non-P instances. in short, maybe this phenomenon is intrisically coupled with P≠NP!
Take graphs such as $G_{n,m}$ graphs, which are graphs chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs which have $n$ nodes, and $m$ edges.This kind of graph has expected edges-$\binom{n}{2}$$m$. The phase transition for the random graph $G_{n,m}$ graphs is not hard for finding the hamiltonian cycles. The paper is http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.5443.pdf. Phase transition in this paper is not defined  as above but they show that there is a correlation between hard instances of hamiltonian cycle problem with the hamiltonicity, and non hamiltonicity. 
another rough argument: all NP complete problems are interchangeable via reductions. if a phase transition is found in a single one, it must be found in all of them.
full disclosure: Moshe Vardi has studied phase transitions particularly in SAT and has a contrasting more skeptical view in this talk/ video.
C coloring of D regular graphs have a series of Discrete transitions, not particularly phased, unless you stretch.
