All your previously opened tabs will be present and the default page position/size will be restored.
First make sure you close the Chrome application (since it still running and writing- and overwriting your changes- to the "Local State" file even though you can't see the maximized Chrome window).
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --window-position=200,50 --window-size=1400,900
To apply these switches, right click the Chrome shortcut and choose "properties". Add the switches to the target textbox. Start each switch with a space followed by -- and then the a switch as shown above. A second switch can be added by leaving a space and then writing the next one. The switches used here are--window-position=200,50
First, close all Chrome windows (and make sure that there are no CHROME.EXE instances running in Task Manager). Open your Chrome profile (the User Data folder) and look for the Local State file. Open it in a text-editor and look for the window_placement section inside the browser section and delete that—this is a structured file, so make sure to get the quotes and braces correctly. (There are other window_placement sections for other things like the Options dialog, Task Manager, etc.) Finally, save and open Chrome; it should open at a “default” location, but should remember where you set it when you subsequently close it.
No, Chrome isn’t a normal window, so ShellBags has no effect on it. Instead, Chrome handles its own window-positioning (well, normally, when it works; sometimes it gets stuck or reset/forgets).
To permanently set the Chrome window size and position add the following switches to the shortcut that opens Chrome. You can adjust the path and numbers to suit your own situation.
What worked super simple for me.  I just right clicked on the close red X and then hit restore.  And that worked.
