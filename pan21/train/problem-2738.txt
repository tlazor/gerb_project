Use a tool like Core Temp or Real Temp to monitor your CPU temperature under idle, light and heavy loads. If the temperature goes up to unsafe levels before your computer BSODs, it means that your heatsink (cooler) hasn't been mounted properly or isn't receiving adequate ventilation.
There is no way to answer this question without it being an opinion...so I will stick to facts and the fact is you can't run a computer without proper cooling and expect it to survive...I am surprised that the computer even booted up. Most computers that I've worked on will try to protect itself by shutting down when the cpu reaches a certain temp and 80 degrees celius is way too high for any machine...I suspect that while you were running the computer without the cooler it damaged the cpu so naturally you will get errors and bluescreens...I would take the cpu out and give it and the heatsink a good cleaning and re-apply the thermal compound and see if that helps... here is a wiki on cpu cooling... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cooling
