As to moving the others, all you've got to think about is it processes them like a list so anything that hits will be processed by the first rule it hits. You can move lo to the top as well but your other rules are probably unlikely to collide with the loopback rule, especially as they are about other destinations/sources.
Having a statefull firewall with the -A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT rule as the first on the external interfaces makes a lot of sense as that is traffic that has already traversed the firewall rules previously and successfully, making the connection approved and nothing is gained by processing those subsequent packets too. On most systems with any significant amount of legitimate traffic that rule will match the vast majority of packets. 
You then typically order the rules on the likelihood they're relevant, i.e. on a webserver you may want a rule that is triggered often such as -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j ACCEPT to come before one that is triggered rarely, such as one allowing access to a management port from your office network.
You can, I have related/established at the top of my iptables chain. It won't allow anything extra in, just anything related to established connections like high port responses or established connections themselves.
Depending on default policy you may or may need the rule allowig all traffic on the lo loopback interface -A INPUT  -i lo -j ACCEPT and -A OUTPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT as the first rule. 
Look at the counters every now and then to check and see which rules are matched frequently to confirm your configuration is somewhat sane. 
Netfilter processes the firewall rules in order. For both security and performance you want packets to transverse as few firewall rules as possible before they are either approved or rejected.
