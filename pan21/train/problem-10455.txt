AFAIK, the only safe way to convert from "dynamic disks" (aka a Logical Disk Manager, or LDM, setup) is to use a Windows tool such as EaseUS Partition Master or Partition Wizard. Note that I've never used either tool, and I may have misremembered one or both names, so check the product descriptions for the ability to convert an LDM disk to a conventional setup before using it.
All my disk partitions including system reserved and c: have become dynamic, due to which I am unable to boot linux. I wish to make some primary partitions. Ubuntu cant help since pc wont boot it even from usb. I have tried using disk management utility but it wont delete c: and system reserved for obvious reasons. But what is surprising is that even if I try to delete those partitions at installation time using bootable win 7 usb, it wont permit me. solution suggested elsewhere is to use a dos dvd. Is there a better way?. Can I use the win 7 command line at install time to do this.? Does working through usb or dvd create a difference.? What commands should I get familiar with?
