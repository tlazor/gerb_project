As this is about new workbooks, the easiest way would be to create a default template that is automatically used by Excel.
I've looked in the usual places, page settings, and printer settings, but unless I go to Page Layout and select A4 for each new sheet, it opens as letter.
Create a new workbook and set all settings you want to have, especially the paper size. For testing purposes I would also suggest that you add some text to a cell in the first sheet so you can easily see when Excel is using the file.
Means, if you are using an English Excel, the file should be named Book.xltx. Since you want to use DIN A4 paper, I’m assuming that you are using a German Excel – in this case the filename has to be Mappe.xltx.
You may find that this issue also shows up in Notepad and Wordpad, but not another Office application like Word.  If so try this.
If it does not show up, it can be because a user default template exists (Excel favors user templates over system templates). The location of the user default template is C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART.
Save this as “Excel Template (*.xltx)” and copy it over to the XLStart of your Office Installation (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\XLSTART). The file name is a little bit tricky since Excel will use a localized filename. 
Exit Excel and restart it. If the new workbook shows the test text you have entered, it has successfully picked up the file.

I've found a few workarounds, but they all require more steps than I can rely on my co-workers to remember everyday.
