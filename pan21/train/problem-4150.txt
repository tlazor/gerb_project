Finally, your secondary DNS server doesn't exist, and is also on the same subnet if it did exist. This effectively breaks the redundancy that having two or more nameservers is supposed to provide. Consider locating your other DNS server somewhere else, for instance on another server in another country, or with a third party provider.
Once you get that straight, you'll find that your zone has no A (or AAAA) records, thus you can't look up the address for, for instance, www.chrisrjones.com. Be sure to add the appropriate A and AAAA records.
So I have been trying to setup BIND / named as a primary / secondary name server for a domain name I purchased a while back because I switched my hosting plan from shared to VPS recently.  I think I have everything setup properly (for the most part) but when I go to ping the domain name I have registered, the command prompt just says unknown host.  I made sure I registered the name servers with the domain name registrar, and I can ping the name servers.  So I know that part is working but for whatever reason I can not ping my domain name.
OK, let's start with your nameserver that's up. In the options in named.conf you have, among other things:
For a proper authoritative name server, you should allow access from anywhere and turn off recursion.
