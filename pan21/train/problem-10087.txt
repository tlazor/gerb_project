I have two DSL lines coming in to wireless access points and then running to a RV082 Gateway/Bridge. The gateway then runs to a switch, which runs to multiple PCs and a Printer (See picture below). Normally, I would set up the wireless access points behind the gateway, but they are also the modems for the dsl.  I have found that I can not print to the network printer if I am connected to the wireless network, but only if I am connected to the wired network.
Get a real Wireless Access Point, preferably one for each band that your users will be operating on. Connecting an 802.11b will take your 802.11g down to 'b' mode.
How can I configure the Gateway and APs (Routers) so that the PCs and Printer are all on the same internal network?
If you really need the wireless units to offer DHCP, set aside a subset of the IPv4 addresses in your network to each WAP. The WAPs should have the default route set to your Gateway. Tell your DHCP server on the wired subnet to not offer IPs in the range set aside for the WAPs.
Also note that it might be saner to disable the WAP transceivers and get a WAP to place on your LAN.
I have tried turning DHCP off or redirect on the APs and redirect them to the Gateway. However, neither of these worked.  Furthermore, I tried pinging the Gateway from the AP but got no response.
You need to determing the subnet that the WAP(s) are using (192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0, for example), make a static route in the RV082 for those subnets and route traffic for those other subnets out the proper interface. Note that both WAPs are probably set to use the same subnet. Either give the WAPs different IPs on the same subnet or different subnet numbers.
I'm familiar with the RV082 and its dual WAN ports. I'm also familiar with DSL modems that have WAPs baked in. What is happening is that your WAPs are on an entirely separate subnet from your LAN.
