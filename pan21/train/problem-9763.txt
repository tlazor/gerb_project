Traceroute works by explicitly setting the TTL field to different values on outbound packets and observing which routers send the ICMP TTL Exceeded errors back for the different TTL values.
If all that is blocked is ICMP Echo Request/Reply ("ping"), this does not inherently block traceroute. However, one possible implementation for traceroute is to send specifically ICMP Echo Request packets.
I am using an isp where I cannot ping google or any other website, but only the name resolution works.
But if you block incoming ICMP packets traceroute won't be able to receive the ICMP responses from the routers in the route and then it won't work.
By default traceroute sends UDP packets to track the route to a given host, while ping uses ICMP. But traceroute works processing ICMP packets returned by the routers in the route to the destination host.
Check the documentation for your traceroute program what it does send. Some implementations have an option to select sending either UDP packets or ICMP Echo Request packets.
Also , if I block ping on my network - at the router level/layer 4 maybe - then is it true that traceroute will also fail ?
