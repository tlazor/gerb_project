Dual booting Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 (Currently on ubuntu so can't check those other keys). 2GB RAM. Sound Card-Realtek AC'97 Audio.
Apparently, this beep sound dates all the way back to the DOS age. If you press a lot of keys, the PC speaker (back then, there's an actual speaker inside the PC) will make a loud beep sound.
If sounds are made when you press the windows key ctrl key and alt and shift it's probably the Sticky Keys function, invoked by quickly pressing the Shift key 5 times in a row. To disable it, press the Shift key 5 times again.
So I just want to know by curiosity, why does this happen. Can I change the sound as per my needs? Or do some fun stuff with it?
Atleast, on my and a few of my friends' PCs, when I press and hold all the arrow keys together on Windows 7 and the System sounds are on in the mixer, a beep sound starts playing until I release the keys. On experimenting, I found the following key combinations do the same:
There is no easy way to change the sound if it is Sticky Keys without third party software or registry/system file hacks.
