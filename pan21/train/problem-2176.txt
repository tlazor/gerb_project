In top, try commands F o to sort by virtual (total) image size. Then you'll see the largest processes up on top.
Is there a silver-bullet method to determine what's going on here?  I'm watching 'top' and while I see the available real memory decline over time I don't see an obvious culprit.
I keep a Ubuntu 7.04 VM running at Linode.com to host a few web sites, e-mail lists, etc.  It was working flawlessly for a long time.  I don't patch it or really pay attention to it.
Perhaps configure a cron job to mail the output of something like ps auxh | sort -r --key=4 | head -5 to you every 30 minutes or so?
You can also remove the requirement for reboots by installing swapd which will automagically create swap files in case of low memory. 
Recently (past few months) and with increasing frequency, the box runs out of memory and I have to reboot it.  Its configured with 350MB real memory, plus 64MB swap.  It runs Apache, Mysql, Postfix, and mailman.
That will let you know the top 5 consumers of memory on the thing, which may help track down the culprit process. The 4th column is the percentage of memory consumed by the process.
