Can I have the same for the internet accounts section, or is there a way to sync the contacts but not the notes, or the mails with my gmail account?
The computer is occasionally used by colleagues, so I do not want to sync my emails or notes. They are personal.
It's easy to export your contacts from your gmail account and import them to another account (https://support.google.com/mail/topic/3397465), and [if necessary] you can set your personal device to sync with your work account [instead of the other way around].
If possible, I would just use another account at work; personal accounts have a nasty reputation for trouble in the workplace.
I believe you would need a separate piece of software to sync just your contacts without leaving your mail and notes just as easily accessible.
In some other sections of the settings app, there is a padlock in the left bottom and you need to unlock this first to make any changes in that section.
Even when I setup the google account as a CardDav account, It is displayed as a standard email account in the internet accounts settings. Here I can choose to sync the mails or the notes without any authorization.
