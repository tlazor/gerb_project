Consider what happens if some construction workers cut an important cable from your ISP. Going to the fallback location just to find the cut cable also breaks internet there? You won't see a happy boss if that happens and both locations are down.
If you really only have a single Provider in town, there's no real technical way to get a backup, after all even the fallback location (assuming it's in the same town) depends on the same uplink provider. There could be another choice, that is swapping fallback location and main location, but I'd only consider that if the current fallback office geographically nearer to the datacenter than the current main office.
If moving to the datacenter is not an option, have the datacenter move to you. That is make a few calls to see if there's any viable option near you.
Aside from that I can't quite believe that there's no second provider in town, if not wired you could (depending on how much your downtime costs you) try to contact a network provider that goes with a satellite link.
Contact your datacenter and ask them what the connections are they have, very often they will not only have large backbone connections but you might find a second ISP for a location near you (given you are already somewhere near the datacenter)
As others have pointed out, a better long term solution might be to get an office in the datacenter so that you have a direct connection
