So, I gave up on Chrome and began to use Firefox.  It worked just fine at first (for the most part) but then it, too, started to do the same thing as Chrome.  Now I use Microsoft Edge and I have a feeling that it's a matter of time before it follows the course of the other two.  What is even more problematic at the moment is that I can't open any Microsoft Excel worksheets either.  (Same problem as with Chrome and Firefox.)
BTW, the computer I am inquiring about uses Windows 10 Home. MS Office 2007 is installed on it.  There are only two users on this computer, but I am not the main user.  If more information is needed in order to answer this question, please let me know.
Out of curiosity, I decided to try to switch my screen to analog and that is when I saw the full windows of the Chrome pages and Excel workbooks I had been trying to open.  Trouble is, I can't get a cursor to appear while using analog mode.  Occasionally, I can get it to click on a cell on the spreadsheet that happens to be open, but other than that, it's pretty much just a ghost of a cursor.  How do I work my way out of this predicament and how do I prevent it from happening again?
Occasionally I work on a desktop computer that uses a Samsung screen.  The screen can switch between analog and digital mode.  I've only ever worked from the digital screen.  Recently, though, I discovered something really strange.  It first started out with not being able to open up Chrome.  I'd double click on the icon at the bottom of the screen, but all that would ever appear is a thumbnail image of the page and one that would never open to a full size (or even minimized) window.
