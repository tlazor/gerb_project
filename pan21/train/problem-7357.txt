OK, I know I just posted this question, but that was at the end of several hours of frustration and it turns out that the one other thing I was going to try actually fixed this issue. 
Test by removing the the USB decoy drive, and restarting Outlook. You should find it no longer complains about not being able to find the OST file. 
After doing that, I exited back out to the main Account Setting dialog (which opened in Step 4). When I went back into the Offline Folder File Settings box, Outlook had already filled it in with the correct path (C:...), and appeared to have re-enabled offline use (the "Disable Offline Use" button was available for clicking again rather than being greyed out). 
That allowed me to access the Data File settings that I was previously blocked from. I then disabled Offline Use because Outlook won't let you change the location of an OST file currently in use. Then I exited and reopened that dialog and found that Outlook had automatically switched it to C:. Seems to be working now. 
... but since you did, you should now see a small settings dialog box with the incorrect pathname listed (D:... for me):
So, if you're having this problem where Outlook is looking for an OST file in a location that does not exist, do the following:
Because Outlook was hellbent on looking for the OST file in D:..., I put in a USB drive and renamed it D:\, then added the path that Outlook was looking for. When I restarted Outlook, I saw an OST file get created in that folder.
