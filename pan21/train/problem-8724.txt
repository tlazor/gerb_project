You can then manually work through that file (/tmp/keepfiles) removing any files you don't want to keep.  You can pretty much remove anything that's not in the /Users directory.  What's left can be copied over to the external with a reasonable amount of confidence that it's not infected.  It's still not guaranteed though.
1 I haven't tested this command, so you may need to tweak it to get it to work right.  Read the man pages.
You're on the right track. Copy it to an external hard drive with a Linux boot CD, then scan it with everything you can.
First off delete any files that could contain a virus - EXE files, VBS, SCR, COM, BAT, CMD - basically anything that can be directly executed.
If there are any other file types you know you'll not be wanting to copy over you can delete those as well - files such as *.ocx, etc.
What I'd do is a partial cleanup of the hard drive first to reduce the chance of getting anything infected.
it will clean your system so you can transfer your files safe. Use it in safe mode with networking  if you can
Once that is all done you can then remove the external drive and clean your hard drive and install Windows a-fresh.  Once you have done that you should install a good anti-malware program - I recommand [Malware Bytes][1], but there are many other good ones around.  Only when one of these programs has been installed should you even consider plugging in the external drive.
Install the compromised drive in an external case or conenect to a system with good AV and antimalware tools.  Scan fully.  Copy the files and avoid any exe or other files that could contain malware.
