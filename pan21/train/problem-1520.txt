Running a graphical desktop will eat a small amount of memory and CPU.  My desktop of 1920x1200x32bit colour takes less than 9MB.  Double or triple that for the applications and if you're having RAM problems the you should look at buying more RAM.  That said, on unix and linux you can shutdown the graphical display to reclaim that small amount of memory.
Well, it might, depends on what your configuration is of course. Do you run Xorg? Do you use a graphical shell with, some compiz/beryl effects to spice things up? Othet than that, I can't think how a plain old ssh connection could affect your server performance. After all, all that is exchanged that way is text.
As others have already said, it makes absolutely no difference whether a monitor is plugged in or not, nor whether it's switched on or not. Even if your system uses "plug and play" to detect monitor features that only kicks in for a very short time when the monitor is first plugged in and takes up pretty close to zero resources.
Having a monitor powered on, powered off, or not physically attached should not affect your server in the slightest.  If anything does happen when you plug/unplug/power on/off a monitor then you should be looking at electrical problems.
Apache is perfectly capable of running continuously without crashing, as demonstrated by several million web servers. I've had it run for a bit over 2 years on one machine. It was only shut down when the office was relocated.
If you are experiencing Apache crashes, as your message suggests, you really need to investigate why but I can assure you it has nothing to do with your monitor unless that monitor is very seriously defective electrically and is causing spikes or overloads on the video port.
