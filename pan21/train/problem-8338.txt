Can I use ordinary bank account? I don't know, ask your bank. You will need routing information, like bank name, account nummber, SWIFT code and so on. Double check what Valve asks you, and ask your bank if they can provide this information
Is "Sole proprietor" legal? I am not qualified to answer this question. Ask a lawyer in your jurisdiction
Is "Sole proprietor" acceptable? If Valve lists it as an option, then I guess it's acceptable for them. I don't understand why they would provide such an option and not accept people who use it, but you should ask Valve instead
What currency should I use? Supposing both options (USD and RUB) are available to you, you can legally use either, and you can provide routing information for either, then I guess that boils down to personal preference. What makes more sense for your needs? You may also want to ask your bank and a lawyer what is better for you
I am based in Japan, and I registered on Valve as a sole proprietor, with a secondary personal bank account (to keep the numbers separated), and with the default tax settings. I have not ran into any problems yet, but I'm not qualified to give legal or financial advice either in Japan, and much less in Russia. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE
As you can see, none of the questions you asked can be answered by game developers. Ask Valve, ask a lawyer, ask your bank.
