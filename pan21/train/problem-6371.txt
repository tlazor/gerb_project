EBS volumes cost per-GB, per-month regardless of their usability. So yes, you are still being charged for that volume.
As it is brand new, you may want to detach it, blow it away, create another one, and reassociate it. If that shows a garbled name as well, see if a reboot causes the name to become less weird.
The first problem isn't on your instance at all... it's your terminal, which isn't correctly configured for utf-8, so you're seeing characters other than what's supposed to be displayed.
Your second volume is xvdf.  If you add a partition table and partitions, you'll see xvdf1, etc., and this doesn't incur any billing above the charge for the volume itself.
The second problem is that you are confusing volumes (disks) and partitions.  xvda1 is the first partition on disk xvda.
What is this garbled name duplicate? I can't find any information on it.  Does this count towards my billing as well?
In many cases in Linux, you don't actually need to partition a disk; the filesystem can just occupy the entire disk (EBS or ephemeral volume in EC2) so you won't have partitions.  The root volume, though, typically does have a partition table and often boots from the first partition.
You are not being billed separately for xvda1 -- it's a partition on xvda -- note how it is labeled part, not disk.
Googling ââ linux will find many examples of this, such as https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=517447
