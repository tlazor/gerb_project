Once the sale of the business closes I won't have access to the DNS records for the domain. As a result I won't be able to control those MX records. I know I can simply change the MX records away from Google and point them to the business' domain mail server. But how do I do this without losing emails?
All of the email from my company domain has been routed through Google Apps for Business (the old Gmail for Domains) for about 8 years. So, MX records for my domain all point to Google's email servers.
So, I'm trying to figure out how to switch off Google Biz Apps handling of the mail to the new server without losing a bunch of emails. Especially, now with all the activity involved in the business sale.
When I started using Google to handle my domain's email I set the TTL to 5 mins, changed the DNS MX Record and waited. It took about 20 hours and I'm sure I lost about 30% of my incoming emails as the MX records moved through propagation.

But now I'm selling my business - including that company domain - and need to migrate all my personal emails away from the company domain to my new personal domain name.
