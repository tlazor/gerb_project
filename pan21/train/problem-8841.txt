But then, I want to change this 50.104.113.XXX into domain name ==> domainname.com. I want to create my own domain name, without leaning on or going anywhere like GoDaddy or any other website and spend money to get one.
After installing everything necessary samba, apache2, webmin, mySQL, etc... through Terminal -- sometimes through ssh root@192.168.1.6 in My PC and sometimes directly in the Terminal of the server.
Finally, now I want to access this website from outside. So, I try to spend sometime how to do it and I finally find an answer by forwarding it.
Then, I went to the browser and typed 192.168.1.1 which is the router IP -- the brand is fronter. So, I went there and forwarded my web server that has the ip 192.168.1.6.
It is fine for me if I need to buy some materials or hardware to setup my web server. Please, help me if you know. 
I have set up my own web server with Ubuntu server 16.04, I am actually using another laptop for testing the web server.
But, this only work on the computer I added it ( for example if I did this in the actual file inside My PC it working) but if it's on the web server it is not accessible.
I did so many researches, read the ubuntu server guide, watching so many tutorial, and forums. But, I am totally stuck. I tried to set up by using Bind, DNS, apache inside webmin. But, it's not working.
So, after I did that, in order to access it outside, I need to know the web server public ip address.
Now, when I browse this 50.103.114.XXX i can see the apache home page and 50.104.113.XXX/mywebsite/index.html for my website.
Then, I create my own web and save it in var/www/html/mywebsite/index.html and I can access it locally under any browser by http://192.168.1.6/mywebsite/index.html. 
Now, when I browse 192.168.1.6 through Chrome, I actually can see the apache home page. everything here seems successful.
