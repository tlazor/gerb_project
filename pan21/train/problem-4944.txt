Just temporarily move your known hosts out of the way and the try ssh -vvv to the host a couple of times there should be a clue in the log.
(I connect to dozens of SSH systems daily, and admin some of them.  But this one I really dont understand the behavior.)
Maybe there is some kind of proxy or weird routing going on?  This is a remote datacenter in europe.  I have the same problem no matter the machine I try to connect from.
Recently, when connecting to a remote machine via SSH, I'm not able to get a stable SSH connection.  It was working OK before, then the system got updated and its not stable anymore.
If not, and you say the machine has been upgraded, then perhaps you just need to delete the old key and re-accept the new one (Usually the warning message displays the local key and line number is known_hosts)
You mentioned that the system got updated. Maybe the SSH keys got re-generated in the process (for example if the system was clean installed). This may be something to consider also, in addition to the other things mentioned.
Are you sure you are connecting to a single host on the remote side, it could be a round robin with different hosts keys on each host ?
