What is the best way to deal with spam or virus infected hosts in wireless network with personal laptops (like personal students laptops in university)? What polices and tools use your company? 
Block their ethernet port as soon as you see problematic activity, take the machine and clean the virus or wipe if necessary, have a "come to Jesus" with them about clicking on email attachments.
Many Wireless Routers and APs support wireless separation, which stops any communication between wireless clients and obviously prevents nasties from spreading, in case your users are not running firewalls.
In fact if you are setting up a small "Hot Spot" with just a Wireless router and a broadband connection and no other hosts then this is pretty much good enough security.  If you want to protect your own hosts that's another matter, I'd NAT against the wireless network and only allow HTTP.  In a sense clients that come at you from a wireless network where people are using their own unmanaged hardware, even if access is controlled, should pretty much be treated as traffic from the Internet and should be firewalled against with only tried and tested protocols like HTTP being used.  I wouldn't use SMB in the scenario for instance.
