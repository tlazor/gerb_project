Even with the above values you can still shutdown the system from the commandline, so in that case just restrict that file.  If you want to get a little complicated and messy create a wrapper/script for it.  By default set shutdown.exe to not be executable, then in your wrapper set it to executable, execute it, then reset it to non-executable.  Place this file in your home directory or use powershell and run it with elevated priv.  There is no need to play move/rename games.  Most users will not go into the commandline(if they even know it still exists) to shutdown a system, and in cases where they do you probably have a bigger issue.
In the OS edit the registry and add/change the following values to prevent users from shutting down the system using the Start Menu.  Make a backup copy of your registry before doing this, just in case.
Then follow my comment above by removing the power button and replacing it with an Aircraft toggle switch.  The power button is just a momentary switch, it you really cared then cut the switch off and then to turn the machine on/off touch the two wires together, but that is an ugly kludge.  The cover on the toggle switch will prevent accidental use and will serve as the giant proverbial red button that you don't want to touch. 
I routinely do similar things on 2k3/2k8 machines that are in a datacenter to prevent accidental powering down of a physical machine and then having to drive out there to push a stupid button.
