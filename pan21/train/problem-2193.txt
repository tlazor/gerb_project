When you're on battery, the computer is likely throttling a little bit to conserve battery life.  This would result in lower temps and lower FPS.  Once plugged in it removes the throttling, raising the temps and FPS (plus it probably has charging heat added in as well).  
In my experience, laptop manufacturers value quiet performance over low heat, so they keep the fans off or on low speed as long as possible.  If you want to preemptively speed up your fans, you might try installing SpeedFan.  For most machines, this will allow you to set your own temps for when to turn on the fan(s), and you can even force them to be on at all times.
As for what temps are too high, you would have to check with the manufacturer of the laptop to be sure, but from the laptop model number, I'm guessing that you have an Intel i7-4720HQ processor, which according to Intel, has a max temp of 100Â°C.  There should be a thermal cutoff in the processor and/or motherboard preventing it from passing this temp, and thus probably preventing any thermal damage.
