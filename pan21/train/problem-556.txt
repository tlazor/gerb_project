The IP we pick to use for our live broadcast is selected from the multicast range, which is goverened by RFC3171. The 239/8 block is for 'internal' use and is not routed over the internet, similar to RFC1918 addresses. Multicast works best when your network has been designed for it. Ours was since we had a dependency on the Service Location Protocol for a long time, and that's a multi-cast based protocol.
Once we pick an address for our broadcast we then assign a DNS name for it. At that point publishing the broadcast is pretty simple, whether it is an all-campus email or posted to the front of our web-page.
The multicast address is chosen arbitrarily out of the 239.0.0.0/8 range (if the application is enterprise-internal, at least). It is then configured on the source(s) and all subscribers.
Windows Media Services has the option of broadcasting live events over multicast. As Lloyd Baker pointed out, this is something that ends up being local to a network. On our University network we would multicast things like Commencement and speeches by the President, which would allow anyone on the network to tune in (which could be thousands) without hammering the snot out of the media server itself. Those who are off-campus would be stuck with unicast to get the live broadcast.
So, there is in general no "directory service" within the network, it relies on human interaction, to configure the applications correctly.
