I've been running x64 Vista since February, and the only hardware that I've found not to have drivers are digital SLR cameras. There are workarounds for getting the files off (memory card reader, or putting the camera in PTP mode), but you won't be able to do anything like tethered shooting.
The main advantage is of course more physical memory for the computer. The disadvantage is that applications tend to use slightly more memory due to the implementation of 64-bit architecture. Most people going 64-bit usually upgrade the amount of memory anyways so this isn't that big of a problem. If you don't multitask that much it shouldn't affect you either way. The majority of your 32-bit applications should work fine.
You will need x64 drivers for all of your hardware. This is not much of an issue anymore as Windows logo certifications requires manufacturers to provide an x64 driver and all Vista drivers are binary compatible with Windows 7.
If you have 16-bit applications or any 32-bit application with a 16-bit installer, you won't be able to run it on Windws 7 x64 (except via "XP Mode", VMWare, VirtualBox et al). I ran into this problem once in 3 years of running Vista x64.
Some manufacturers are yet to commit to creating 64 bit drivers as well. As I see it, this is a bit of commercial suicide as it is photographers with fancy DSLRs that make the most out of having large amounts of RAM available...
