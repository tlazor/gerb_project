Try this, from the windows xp box, run the following command "nbtstat -a server"  (server being the name of your windows 2008 R2 box).  if nothing comes back, netbios isn't working and thus your network places will not work.
Is the firewall on the server using the Domain profile and is the Network Discovery service allowed?
Even if you've started the Browser service on the Windows Server 2008, it may well be that it is somehow prevented from sending or receiving the NetBT browsing announcements and request packets - if you are using a firewall or have the Windows Firewall enabled consider disabling it for testing purposes.
You should use the browstat.exe tool from the XP SP2 support tools for further troubleshooting - especially to determine your current subnet's Master Browser and the Domain Master Browser.
Do you have more than a single network / broadcast domain in your setup? If so, you will need to have a WINS server and set up your clients and your servers to point to it in order to have them all correctly appear in the browsing list.
Sounds like the XP clients are configured to prefer NetBIOS name resolution.  Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) on the clients.
As mentioned, WINS helps out a lot with this.  Does your windows 2008 box have any WINS servers configured under it's TCP/IP properties?  If you're not using WINS, and the server / client are on different vlan's, then I don't think the XP client will be able to see Windows 2008 box.  Netbios works by broadcasts, and broadcasts aren't passed across vlans's typicaly. This is where WINS comes into play.  If they're on the same subnet, check the TCP/IP properties of the network adapter (on both boxes) and ensure that netbios is set to default.
