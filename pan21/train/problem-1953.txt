I can't really say if there is an easy way to do collisions without knowing everything about your game :) Anyway, it depends on your definition of word "easy". It looks like you knowledge about collisions is rather limited, so chances are that it won't be very easy. 
If I guessed right and you're aiming at a simplest form of collision, 2D rectangle tile collision, then there is a simple and quite complete tutorial series. There you will feel how basic things are done with tile-based collisions, jumping and platforms included. No need to code it yourself in Flash, just read it and remember terms for Googling later.
Onto the next question, I highly doubt that MegaMan and SuperMario used .txt map file format considering the fact that games back then were often written in assembly language and had limited memory, so they were probably just storing tile arrangement in some segment of the ROM. Game developers use any map format they want within platform limitations, I've seen bitmap file formats where pixel colors represented tile types, but it's usually some kind of a binary format.
Seriously though, investigate topic of collisions by reading that tutorial link and using help of mighty Google, think and let it sink for a while, come back with specific questions later. For a map file either save/load your data manually into/from any format you want or use serialization.
