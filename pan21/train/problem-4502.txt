Unfortunately there is no such a solution for FreeBSD. There are many solutions like dummynet/ipfw or altq/pf which are used to limit network usage based on different patterns but not on pids.
lsof the process to get the network ports that the proc is using. Once you know which ports are being used you can use IPTABLES rules to rate limit these ports. These articles should give you a better idea: 
In Linux, even combination of iptables and tc could be a hard problem, since the "--pid-owner" option was abandoned from "owner" iptables module (see note below the table here). In fact, only this association (packet--process) seems to be complicated, while we can easily do the rest, i.e. filter and limit packets quite efficiently. 
Crudely, if you nice the process down to +20, then anything else running on the system will get priority and the job will be scheduled less often, so will find it harder to fill the buffers or process packets, which should lead to some TCP throttling.  It will be sporadic, but might help enough.
