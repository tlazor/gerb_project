This leaves quite a bit of possibilities out there.  Widescreen is a plus, if you can get a desk to accommodate the additional space needed.  It's also a setup that is within reasonable reach of mom-and-pop, i.e. it's a realistic goal that can be achieved by them if they want it.  Spending thousands for ultra-high-end monitors is nice but frankly not everyone can plunk down that kind of money, especially if they have a house, kids, cars, cards, etc.
3x 21 inches. It gives you a clear "primary" monitor to work on with a couple of secondary monitors to integrate with. Too much more than 21" and it is hard to fit it on a desk.
I like multiple screens for gaming, or be able to dedicate different screens to different things (like VMWare sessions or video)
I'd love to have three 1280x1024s, but for space and pocketbook reasons I have one 1280x1024 and one 1024 x 768 at home at the moment.
I'm probably in the minority in that I'm not a huge fan of going larger than 1280x1024. Any larger than that and I start having to do desktop window management instead of just maximizing everything. Kind of a pain.
