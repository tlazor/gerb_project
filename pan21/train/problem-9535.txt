Since laws do change unpredictably, the best thing to do is to consult a qualified lawyer who has experience with "intellectual property" in your country (or countries) to get an interpretation of the law that will be useful to you.
Yes, under the DMCA it is illegal  if you had to break the copy protection in order to do so. The Wikipedia article on the DMCA describes it this way. The bit that applies to copies is in bold. 
There are exemptions to the DMCA which are listed in the linked article. As far as I can tell, it doesn't include making copies for private use.
The DMCA is a U.S. law and applies only in the United States and its territories. It's based on provisions of the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties. Many other countries have laws that implement these treaties, although in different ways. 
Simple answer is if you are breaking the copyright protection then yes it is illegal. It is one of those things though where if you are only ripping them for your personal use and not distribution then you are not going to get in trouble for it. So, yes it is technically illegal, but you will be fine in your scenario.
It depends on which country you're in.  If you're not in any country at all (e.g., you're on international land, which I believe can be found at most aeroports/airports), then there may be other requirements you have to be aware of.
