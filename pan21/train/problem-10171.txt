You can look for other indicators of a bad line - check your ADSL router's administration interface.  Some indicate the ping there, you may also see the number of (corrected) errors that are occuring, etc.
Because of successive interruptions, I contacted the ISP.  At first I had a vocal robot on the line leading to automatic checks on my line even before talking to a real person.  Then first level support did checks and indicated that the issue was in my building.  We agreed that the ISP would send a technician.
In the mean time he had verified that the signal level arriving at the premisis was within the guaranteed levels, and did several measurements with his specialized equipment.
The technician then did the local verification and determined that line was unbalanced because of an issue in the connection of the RJ wall connector.  Once resolved, the line was balanced again.
I do not think that they will need/understand these reports.  You can say you have a high ping and they'll surely proceed with verifications.
So you should give your ISP a call so see how it works - you can always abandon and do further investigations before you request a techician that may be at your charge if the issue is not from the ISP.
