The actual change that is done by this is that the lower checkbox forces Windows to replace the current permissions for the folder contents recursively with the permissions of the folder you rightclicked, so all broken permissions are fixed. Worked like a charm for me, and is also really quick (only a few seconds for a lot of files).
In german, you do: Rightclick on the parent folder of the folder where I used sed, "Eigenschaften" (context menu), "Sicherheit" (tab in the dialog), "Erweitert" (button), "Berechtigungen Ã¤ndern..." (button with UAC prompt), now I just check both checkboxes (the upper one is set already, but the lower is not, but has to be). Now I click on "OK" for three times.
I had exactly the same trouble after using find in combination with grep and sed under cygwin to process a folder full of Java source code files automatically. Sed messed up the NTFS file permissions of my files, which was still persistent after a reboot, so I searched for an easy way to fix this.
I actually found an easy way to get the file permissions back to the old values. It can be done for a whole folder recursively, which is important to me, since I have modified so many files at once (several hundred). Sadly, I only know the german names for the menu entries, so I'm not sure how the menu entries (in the Windows Explorer) are called in correct english.
