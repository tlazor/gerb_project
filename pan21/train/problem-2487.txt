As virtual mentioned, regular VMs in azure are not tied to run on a unique physical host, they can be moved using what in hyper V is called "live migration" feature to any host in a pool of resourced defined by them (A very large pool from what i can tell).
Regarding the second question,it's a new service in preview, there is no much info but based in experience with other providers, if you decide to provision only one host, if it fails, it fails. If you provision more than one host, the VM is moved to any of them.
The storage is separated from the physical host so in a over-simplified way this mean that the virtual machines is no other thing that a large memory block, they freeze (quiesce) for a second that block, and then move it to another physical host. Unfreeze it and voila.
This live migration can be triggered by a number of reason, maintenance windows, lack of resources, or even certain host failures and You as a user, can trigger a Live migration anytime using the "redeploy option" in the azure console.
