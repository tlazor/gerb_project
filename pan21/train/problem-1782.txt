Just had this issue myself. j_foster's idea seems to work well. However it's better to use the Entry ID of the appointment item to identify the index of the notification. Then one can use remove().
It appears that the application reminders macro needs to finish to be executed in order to dismiss reminder event.
According to the MSDN  the Applcation.Reminder event used Slipstick's macros is executed before the reminders dialog appears. But the Reminder.Dismiss method requires that a reminder (not sure if it has to be the same one) is already displayed in the reminder dialog. That's why this is not working. That said, AFAIK there's no guarantee that Reminders(1) will be the reminder that just fired; you may be trying to dismiss the wrong reminder.
I was able to create a recurring email via a code in vba that triggers every time that a reminder with a certain category fires.
As a possible solution (which I must emphasize, I have not tested), try using Reminders.Remove(Item.Subject). The documentation seems to indicate that Reminders.Remove requires the numerical index, but it's worth a try. Also, if two items with reminders have the same subject, there's no guarantee that you'll get the right one.
