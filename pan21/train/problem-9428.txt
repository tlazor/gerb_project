Second; Its totally up to you to take those IPs into different VLANs. As I mentioned above, if you want to secure your network using basics or if you think that there will be wrong usage of the network that may create problems you should do that.
However our previous network was without a VLAN and we have secured the iSCSI, local and management network by using dynamic firewall rules and by programming switch using SDN methods. So if you can manage you dont need for VLANs. (As far as I know, your switch does not support this)
You could put all of the internal traffic (including the iSCSI traffic) on a single VLAN but that's not recommended and isn't considered best practice.
First; We are in the same situation right now. We are building a new design on our cloud using Force10 and Juniper networks and we created 7 or 8 different VLANs. This is because we are planning a massive amount of servers behind this network and we wanted to secure network starting from basics.
That being said, your design looks perfectly OK. You're segregating your public and private traffic and you're isolating your iSCSI traffic.
On the other hand; you should also look from the management perpective. The more standart network you make, the more ease your job in the future. Do not forget to think about learning curve for your design for other system admins. If you are the only guy there and will be, its okey to make complex architectures but if you are a system admin, you sould think about other admins coming behind you. Plus if your system admins are dumb as ours you should again create a network that does not create problems to you :)
