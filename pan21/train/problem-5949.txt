What you are looking for is called a comparator. This will "compare" two analogue inputs (call them "A" and "B") and output a "1" if A > B. Typically you'd have an adjustable reference voltage on "B" and your sensor on "A" and the output into your Pi GPIO (with appropriate level shifting etc.etc.). You can then use the hardware edge detection on the GPIO to trigger your callback.
If the signal you are measuring, once over the trigger point, tends to hover and then drop back down then it might be worth considering a Schmitt trigger, a special type of comparator  with a well defined hysteresis between two thresholds. It will "latch" on when the input first crosses the upper threshold and stay on until the input drops below the lower threshold.
If you are concerned about catching "fast" events you may want to think about using an RC network on the output to lengthen short pulses (or a NE555 in monostable configuration).
No, the ADC can't be used to trigger an event. It's only function is to represent some analogue input as a digitally quantized output.
