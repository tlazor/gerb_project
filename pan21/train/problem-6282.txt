I am worried about db performance if the server having swap. But I do not know how to stop the Mysql ram usage. I can not see why it gradually use so many RAM.
Could somebody give me some hint for make sure mysql server not gradually having high RAM usage? Or is there something I need to consider. Is the ubuntu have some setting which will cause RAM consumption?
If you can't manage that yourself then hire a professional (DBA/Sysadmin) who will probably end up being cheaper than you trying to do it yourself anyway\
Because original Mysql innodb_buffer_pool_size(49G) is so big that the server use SWAP. So I set the innodb_buffer_pool_size to 35G then restarting the server(10/12). However, the RAM usage gradually get high, almost 90% of physical RAM after two days. I think it is no reasonable since innodb_buffer_pool_size is 35G and other Mysql operation will not use so many RAM.
Set buffer pool as high as 50G if it's a dedicated mysql server, check for NUMA settings and configure accordingly.
There is no magic 'use less RAM switch' so the usual sysadminly things apply understand what is happening and take appropriate action. Scientific method is your friend
