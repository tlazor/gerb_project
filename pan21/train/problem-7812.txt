Does Otis pick up the SSL sessions that Milo had automatically? Does my browser start to communicate with Otis and Otis says "Hey, we should probably shake hands first."? Any and all comments/answers about this would be appreciated.
I have two servers, let's call them Milo and Otis. Now Milo and Otis are setup to be an active-passive pair of highly available servers where Milo is usually the master and Otis stands-by waiting for the unlikely failure of Milo when Otis will take over the shared virtual IP. I have a question about what happens to the SSL connection during the failure.
When failover occurs, currently active connections will break. This will happen the TCP level however, so SSL/TLS won't even enter the scene. A TCP connection requires that both endpoints know about the connection and have the right information (sequence numbers, window sizes, etc.), and so when the IP fails over the backup machine will have no knowledge of the TCP connections which the master had established. When the backup machine receives packets which are part of previous TCP connections it will reply with an RST packet, which will cause the client to close the connection.
Even if TCP connections were recovered, a similar situation would occur with SSL/TLS. Each session requires state at each end, including the session key (which is what actually secures the application data). The backup machine won't have this session state, and so existing sessions would be terminated.
