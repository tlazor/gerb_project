And after reboot, the file is not present, and adapters still sometimes switch places. Any hint or idea how to fix this annoying issue is greatly appreciated.
What sometimes (1/10 times) happens is, after reboot, the adapter names switch places, and all of a sudden eth1 has a MAC address that eth0 had before reboot, and has a DHCP obtained address. This happens in the initial ram disk as well.
Now, Debian Jesse and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS both had /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules which clearly stated which MAC belongs to which interface name. This file does not exist on my systems, I never removed a single package nor deleted that file from those two systems. I tried recreating the file with:
I have two server systems, one running Debian Stretch, the other Ubuntu 17.10, both of which have two network adapters, configured in the following way (/etc/network/interfaces):
On both systems, the first adapter is always connected to the local network, and the second one is almost never connected to anything, but occasionally used for testing network equipment.
Also, initial ram disks on both systems have the same IP addresses (yes, I an using the "old school" interface names) configured with (/etc/default/grub):
