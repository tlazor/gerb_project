Unfortunately for all of us, you can't just install one of these clusters and watch your WoW framerates multiple by a factor of 15!
HPC seems to be built on Platform Computing's packages, so there should already be a subset of applications that run on it.  Stuff like chemical analysis and advanced modeling and whatnot. All of which would be written to take advantage of the multi-node environment.
So there is more than one flavor of cluster out there, RH Cluster provides just one... HPC the other.  A quick from-memory run down:
As your interest seems to be more HPC, the applications will have to be written to take advantage of the cluster grid.  This is a lot like the older Beowulf systems, which used to have a series of system calls which let users move processes between nodes (bproc_move, et al). You then had to have a way to correlate the result sets.  
Assuming you're using the Lucci/Ricci style clustering, you're getting #1.  It's meant to provide classic high availability. Applications do not necessarily have to have been written to take advantage of clustering, as to your apps, resources are all local.  There are some things that help, though (such as being able to bind a server to a single address).
