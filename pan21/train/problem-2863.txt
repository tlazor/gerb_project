Then open up Excel and paste.  You might have to do some formatting for dates & such but that will be a lot less work (and easier for a person to read).
First a partial answer to your question.  You could use dynamic SQL.  This would be a starting point:
That said .. based on your comment wouldn't it be easier to generate an SSRS report?  It would be far more attractive and is what it's actually there for. That's of course assuming you need a report you want to run on a regular basis.  If not and if you don't know SSRS, don't have time to learn it, or don't have it installed, another option is to just run your query and save the output as a CSV with headers.
The output of this will give you a CONCAT string for each column.  You could then dump them into a query and wrap a CONCAT around it (eliminating the first comma).  It's possible to do this completely dynamically but even this much is going to give you fits if you have any collation issues.  The more dynamic you make something the more careful you have to be to cover every possible variation.
Run your query, select all of the output, then right click on the output and select Copy with Headers (or Save Results As .. to save a CSV)
