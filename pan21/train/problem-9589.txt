So, the solution, in my case, was to safely shut down the computer, remove the USB device, access Windows Explorer settings (advanced section of them, I think) and turn off the default showing of recent files. Maybe I even turned off the Quick Access section, I forget. Having done so, I was then able to open Windows Explorer and plug in the USB device, and right-click it, go to Properties, and toggle the "Optimize for Quick Removal" property off and back on. This resulted in the device working properly, being accessible, and no longer causing problems.
Sadly the problem reoccurred after some more Windows 10 updates a month later, but I figure the default Windows Explorer behavior probably just got set again and I expect the same fix will work this time too.
What happened was, I had not tried copying newly taken photos from my camera memory cards, via a USB flash-memory card reader, to my computer's drives, since several Windows 10 updates ago. During that time, Microsoft changed a policy or a behavior, such that certain USB devices that formerly had the "Optimize for Quick Removal" policy set and associated with the device's ID, lost that setting. But that alone was not enough to cause Windows Explorer crashes (and associated problems such as Adobe and other image-processing software hanging indefinitely upon attempting to access the USB card reader). The other step that made the problem show itself was some kind of minor change in Windows 10's Windows Explorer behavior -- specifically, that Explorer's defaults changed such that it automatically, by default, lists recently-accessed locations in the left sidebar up there in (I think) the Quick Access section. And in doing so, unfortunately, it also tries to scan some metadata about the contents of said locations (I'm not exactly clear on the details of this part, but the general idea is right). Finally, there's some kind of interaction between those two issues such that the USB device causes Explorer to hang.
