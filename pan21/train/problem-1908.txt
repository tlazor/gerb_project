I have a production server running vmware server 2.0.  I want one of the VM's (company intranet) to power on automatically if the host server is rebooted.  I searched online and found references to an autostart setting for the global configuration file and/or the local VMX files.  However in all cases, the advice was given 4 years ago, so I am not sure if this even applies anymore.  Should I just put a shortcut to the .vmx file in the startup group?  Is there a better/different way?  Thanks all!
In the VMWare Server GUI, select host in the "Inventory" panel (root node of the tree), to the right "Commands" panel should appear with "Edit Virtual Machine Startup/Shutdown Settings".  There will be an option to autostart the guest VM.
under the inventory, highlight on the host name (physical machine name) not the VM that you want --> then from the right you will find (Edit Virtual Machine Startup/Shutdown Settings)
I unfortunately do not have a running VMWare console nearby, but there is a Startup and Shutdown either under the Virtual Machine menu or the virtual machine configuration. There is a simple tick box that specifies whether you want the machine to auto start, and you can also specify a delay. You can also control in which order the machines start.
