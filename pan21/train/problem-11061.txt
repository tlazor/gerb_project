This has always worked for me, on multiple different VPNs. IIRC Cisco VPN client also has an option to bypass vpn for local access.
The VPN is providing encryption of the data you are accessing so that someone between you and them cannot sniff the sensitive data.  It also requires that you connect to the large company's internal network which is way more secure than having an internet accessible page that anyone could get to.  Making you download a certificate also means that in order to access their network, someone would have to be on one of your computers.  It couldn't be just some random user that tries logins and passwords against a web interface until they get access.
I don't use the vpn in browser, but I get your problem even on a desktop vpn client. This is what I on Windows to be able to connect to machines in local network
Client certificates prevent casual password guessing and URL manipulation/injection attacks, but user/pass for the specific service is still needed since once you have handed out the client cert to someone you have no control over what they do with it, unless it is on the smartcard, but this is a much more complicated (read expensive) story.
In similar cases I give external customers SSL+client certificate access, together with username and password for the particular service. 
Limiting access to any destination other than defined in the VPN tunnel is known as split-tunneling and is done to prevent the remote machine from acting as a conduit for malware from the Internet into the private network.
If you check ipconfig /all it should show your local network IP as well as VPN assigned IP. Say you local IP is 10.0.0.5 and you want to connect to 10.0.0.3 on your local network.
I think this is a case of "one size fits all", they probably give the same access to everyone, no matter if they acrually need it or not as this is the cheapest and most comfortable solution.
