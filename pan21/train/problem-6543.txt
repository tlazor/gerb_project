Part of it also probably comes from the fact that people running Linux are (generally speaking), more technical, and thus less likely to make the stupid mistakes that lead to computers getting hacked.
There's no real reason other than inertia.  I've seen a lot of Linux advocates making arguments against Windows (and not just on the security side) which on the surface seem valid, but - which when you dig a little - only apply to Windows 3.1 or 95/98.
So, in my book, it's a mixture of inertia, prejudice and being embedded in the UNIX culture to the exclusion of alternatives.
I've said it before, but while Windows may have more patches/etc, these are fixes for security vulnerabilities that have been identified.  And it's not the ones that have been fixed that you have to worry about, is it?  I don't believe that being open source is intrinsically more secure either.  Rolling your own patches may be fine for a home user, but a corporate user or admin will always want the Real Thing that is certified to work (and to have been tested fully) with a variety of apps, and that is certified to not break the next kernel update.  The same applies to fixes from the FOSS community.
Linux was designed to be a multi user system from early on, so it has a much stronger permissions system than Windows does. It was also designed for you not to be running with administrative rights (root access), so all the programs are designed not to need the rights. This means if your account gets compromised, the entire system isn't.
