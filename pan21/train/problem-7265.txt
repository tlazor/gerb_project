If it is possible, wondering roughly what is required. I have built many web servers but I haven't built a DNS server, and not sure what that even means or what it entails.
I would like to have the following functionality. If users want a custom domain, they simply enter example.com for the A-name record, and example.com for the CNAME record.
Second question is what exactly happens when the user specifies 66.6.44.4 (or in my case, example.com) as the A record, and likewise for the CNAME record. From what I can imagine, the request starts off in the browser as example.com. The A record was published into some domain registrar's system (maybe this is the DNS server, so like GoDaddy if the domain was registered there for a tumblr site), which connects somehow to the external registries of some sort. This makes it possible to discover that 66.6.44.4 is the address we want to go to. Question is, what happens at the server at that endpoint, what it does. It seems it would know the domain being requested, then it would look up your tumblr profile given that info. Not sure.
Basically looking for a brief explanation of how a system such as Tumblr's Custom Domain feature is implemented. What the A and CNAME records are allowed to be (if they can both be example.com for example). And generally how the request to a Tumblr page would be directed by using the A and CNAME records.
