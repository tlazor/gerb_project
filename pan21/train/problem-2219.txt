Now I have the problem, that DNS Names are not resolved locally. So I cannot open google.com or microsoft.com nor anything else.
I have a server named WIN-FOOBAR and a domain named foo.bar.com, so there are two entries _msdcs.foo.bar.com and foo.bar.com.
If the DNS server is both used by internal clients and hosts your public DNS zone then you're doing it wrong and you should separate the two.
I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 server which is hosting a public website. I recently deactivated "DNS Recursion" for security options trough the following method:
In the properties of my DNS server in the "Advanced" tab under server options I check the option: Disable recursion.
In addition, the presence of the _msdcs zone tells me this server is the DNS server for your AD domain, in which case I would strongly suggest that you not use this server to host your public DNS zone and that you don't make this server accessible to the outside.
If the DNS server is for your public domain name/zone and is not used by internal clients then you can disable recursion altogether and you don't need to do anything more than create a zone for your public domain name and make sure that you have the proper NS records registered at your Registrar.
If the DNS server is only accessible to and only used by internal clients then you can leave recursion enabled.
