Has anyone done this before?  Do I need software, open-source or not, to do this?  Or maybe there's a way to export all the server settings in some way?  Thanks in advance!
Install on the old server as you have in the past. Before you shutdown the last time, open C:\boot.ini, add /detecthal to the end of the Win Server 03 line (remove /fastdetect if it's there)(This works on WinXP and 2003 only). Use Ghost (or ImageX from the WinAIK, free here) to make an image file of the system, and drop the image on the new hardware.It should boot right up, you might have to remove the old NICs as described here.
I am going to be setting up a "real" server, but it's not being shipped for another week.  I was planning on setting up most of the server's functionality using an extra workstation I have.  I wanted to set-up Windows Server 2003 or 2008, IIS, Terminal Services, Firewall, and Antivirus on this regular machine.  I'd also be installing software like Winzip and VMWare that'll be used on the server.
I can't ghost the machine, as far as I've done in the past, because the motherboard/cpu/etc. will all be different.  Is there any way to export all of the "server settings" or something like that so I can move everything from test to production?  Is there any software out there that does something similar to this?  Some things I'm going to have to wait on such as setting up the file server completely in its raid configuration, but I'd like to get the simple server stuff and network setup out of the way.
