(1) I've been the unhappy sysadmin who is out looking for rogue DHCP servers.  When VP-Finance can't do some presentation because his laptop is bound to some VM server somewhere, I get to go around the floor with a hammer looking for things to turn off.  With all due respect, when your tools can have an enormous negative effect on your LAN neighbors, you better know what you are doing BEFORE you turn them on.
With VMware, the solution is to set up the VMs as being "NAT" clients.  This will set up a private network for the VMs, but will act as a gateway so that those VMs can interact with the rest of the network.
I'll speculate that you have a VM network that you are feeding from your host with DHCP.  You've bridged that network onto your local area network, and now your VM host is serving DHCP to unsuspecting neighbour computers, earning you the well deserved(1) ire of your network/sysadmin, right?
Alternatively, you can set up your VMs to be on a "bridged" network, and instead of using your VMware-provided DHCP server you then use the LAN's DHCP server.  Your VMs then behave like any other node connected to the LAN.
