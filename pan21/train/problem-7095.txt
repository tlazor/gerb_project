When you run an installer on a 32-bit operating system, it installs the 32-bit versions of the program's components in the correct locations for a 32-bit operating system. A 64-bit operating system would require different components in different places. The only way to get them there is to run the installer.
No, that can't possibly work. The 64-bit versions of those programs and their components aren't installed on your 32-bit system. So you have to install them all.
You could use this Microsoft Sysinternals tool to capture a VHD of your Hard Drive(s), which you could then mount onto a virtualisation software (VMWare Player, Virtualbox) to use within the virtual machine. There is no way, however, to 'import' your 32-Bit applications into your 64-Bit Windows 10 install, you'll need to re-download the relevant versions to install onto the new install.
There is an idea about saving the current machine stat in a virtual machine (virtualizing a physical machine) and save it in an external storage then install 64 Bit system and install the virtual machine to reinstall all the programs , services , registry keys and the files . So with this way I will be able to upgrade from 32 Bit to 64 Bit without reinstalling my programs , so does anyone of you have any idea about that If it is then share it with me here please ?(I'm using windows 10)
