However, since the medium is shared ("air" / Frequency) you need to devide the #Bandwidth by the number of connected devices (since each will get their own share of the bandwidth).
First of all, what is the device you are connecting to ? If it's your home router, provided by your ISP then no such low hard limits should be in effect (although that may be ISP related policy, cannot comment on that).
If you are both, for instance on 5 Ghz and your channels are near each other (you on 2, him on 3) and you see a free channel, try and switching your router to use the channel that is free. That could improve both your connectivity as well as throughput.
You can, theoretically, connect 254 devices to a single Wi-Fi router/access point (you have to substract the gateway address and the broadcast address). But that doesnâ€™t mean you should.
You will be limited by CSMA/CA nature, not by IP addresses. The rule of thumb is 25 clients per access point.
Hope this helps you out a bit, at least be able to identify / troubleshoot some basic things (By using the WiFi analyser).
Generally speaking WiFi does not have a "cap" on # connections except when the medium it uses to send / receive data is saturated. In practice that means that, if you have a WiFi hotspot capable of 802.11N for instance running 5Ghz frequency theoretically you'd have 300Mbps throughput.
By the way, you should read the specs of the Access Point you are using. Not all AP support the same number of devices against it
and see if your WiFi is sharing the Frequency AND Channel with a neighbour who also has WiFi on for instance.
For instance, run a WiFi analyzer (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/wifi-analyzer/9nblggh33n0n)
