I need to add myself to the "db_datawriter" role.  When I try, I get error 15247 - User does not have permission to perform this action.
Is there anything I can do to give myself this role?  As a Windows administrator on the box I would have thought that it would be possible...
I tried using the above approach for SQLExpress to no avail. For whatever reason, adding the -m flag to the Startup Parameters was causing SQLExpress to fail on start up. So I did some searching and found this blog post which seemed to do the trick of getting SQLExpress into Single-user Mode, and then followed yrushka's steps for adding a user.
In SQL Server 2008, Windows admins are no longer SQL Server admins by default. You will have to ask somebody else to change your permissions.
You can add yourself even if you are not sysadmin on SQL Server but are part of administrators group. 
My username appears in the Security -> Logins section of the SQL Server Management Studio and under Properties -> Server Roles I see I have the "public" role only.  Under "User Mapping" I'm a member of the "db_datareader" and "public" roles.
