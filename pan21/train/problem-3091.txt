And therefore, when you add up the costs like those, it may be deemed that continuing with a "potentially" still-compromised system is better than reinstalling the system. 
Most likely they don't have a disaster recovery routine that is tested enough for them to feel confident in doing a rebuild, or it's unclear how long it would take or what the impact would be... or backups are unreliable or their risk analysts don't understand the scope of a compromised system. I can think of many reasons.
Practically speaking, most people don't do it because they think it'll take too long or be too disruptive.  I've advised countless clients of the likelihood of continuing problems, but a reinstall is often shot down by a decision maker for one of those reasons.
That being said, on systems where I'm confident that I know the entry method and the full extent of the damage (solid off-machine logs, typically with an IDS, perhaps SELinux or something similar limiting the scope of the intrusion), I have done a cleanup without reinstall without feeling too guilty.
A security decision is ultimately a business decision about risk, just as is a decision about what product to take to market. When you frame it in that context, the decision to not level and reinstall makes sense. When you consider it strictly from a technical perspective, it does not. 
I'd say it's mostly something amiss in the basic routines and policies and that is not something you'd want to admit openly - and instead you take a defensive stance. At least I can't see or defend not wiping a compromised system no matter what angle you look at it.
