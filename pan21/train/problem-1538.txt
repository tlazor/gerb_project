The variables choice1, choice2 and choice4 hold the same value regarding the business case: the first selected service ID.
You declare multiple variables input with numbers. There should be only one variable input since System.in is a singelton and cannot be accessed concurrently anyway.
There should be only one variable firstSelectedServiceID to be used in all cases of the outer switch.
Finding good names is the hardest part in programming. So always take your time to think carefully of your identifier names.
You have some identifiers which are named after their technical implementation: the same name with numbers. 
A proper solution would try to calculate the best plan combination, so that adding new plans and/or services would just be a configuration.
On top of that your code fails if the user enters the service IDs in an unexpected order, eg.: 4 3 1.
Since you only use this variable at only one method in our code which is the same where you assign it its value this is not needed.
There is nothing wrong with procedural solutions as such but Java is an object oriented programming language and therefore you should learn to find OO-ish solutions to problems.
