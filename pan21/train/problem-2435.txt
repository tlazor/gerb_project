It turns out that the answer to "does the API provide sufficient information to work?" is, as of ISC DHCP 4.3.1, "no, it does not".  However, I've just spent a chunk of time putting together a patch set to extend the server to provide (just) enough information to add and remove routes.  My changes are available at https://github.com/mpalmer/isc-dhcp, in the client-address-data-expression branch.  There's a script in contrib that demonstrates how it can be used.
You mention that you're using dhcpd for prefix delegation, so that's apparently running on a *ix box of some sort, which usually isn't acting as a router.  The usual setup would be to have the client running OSPFv3 or another routing protocol.  It would receive the prefix delegation, assign appropriate link prefixes to its attached interfaces, and then advertise those routes to the other routers in the network.  If for some reason you are running routing on a Linux/BSD machine and don't want to or can't move it, then I recommend running Quagga1 to insert the appropriate routes into the server's routing table.
