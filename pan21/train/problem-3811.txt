However, consumer-grade parts aren't in general designed for long-term 24/7 loads. It is thus fairly likely that the card will die sooner than if it wasn't subject to such loads. It is hard to say how much sooner without having some more statistics on a given model. Some people in the HPC community advocate using high-end gaming GPUs instead of special HPC compute parts, and there seems to be some economical sense in that. Although the commodity parts die in a year or so, it's cheaper to keep replacing them because they're many times cheaper than the alternative
Long-term overheating of the GPU chip probably won't start a fire. The chip may deteriorate and start misbehaving or die completely, but silicon chips aren't too flammable. Bad things usually happen when electrolytic capacitors fail and blow up, but these won't be subject to overheating just because the card is doing a lot of crunching and you also hopefully have a metal PC case to contain the hot shrapnel that results from such failures.
