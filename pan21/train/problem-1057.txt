The second one is when you set up a tun/tap connection, and are offered the possibility to choose between a bridged and a routed configuration. This occurs with certain VPNs (OpenVPN is a good case in point), or with Virtual Machines inside a hypervisor (the NAT connection is the routing connection here). These connections are fundamentally different, a bridge working at the Layer 2 level, and a tunnel at the Layer 3 level. Bridging works to join two separate networks as if they were one, while routing connects them, while keeping them distinct. This means all the applications which rely on working on a single subnet (samba anyone?) will not work out of the box  with a routed solution, which may be a hindrance (Samba,like I said) or a plus (for instance, with a routed solution you do not waste precious bandwidth to send ICMP packets from one subnet to the other). 
The first one is in switching. The simple switch you have at home forwards traffic correctly, but it is not a router. What is the difference? The switch is a Layer 2 object, it uses a different protocol (ARP) to forward to a MAC address. The router instead sends packet on to the net hop, on the basis of their IP address, a Layer 3 concept based on a different protocol (IP). As a matter of fact, we all know you cannot substitute one for the other, and this is the reason. 
In a way. Frank Thomas' explanation above is quite good,but let me add one thing. Of course all modern PCs are built to make their users oblivious to the difficulties of the TCP/IP stack, so that not only their routers but also their pcs contain seven layers, without anyone noticing.  Yet you do come into close contact with them on least a couple of occasions.
