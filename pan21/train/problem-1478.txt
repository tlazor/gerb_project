Have you looked at Windows Live Skydrive?  25GB of free storage per Windows Live account, with the ability to share specific folders with specific Windows Live users...So if each family has one account, then you each have plenty of space for each family's photos...Three families, say, has 75 GB of storage combined...
We've always been trying to share photos within our family, despite all living in different countries. This has been very challenging. We have about 50GB of photos that we share with each other. Everyone organizes them differently, so rsync/Syncplicity don't work. Everyone likes their photos on the fast hard drive rather than a slow website with reduced quality, so online sharing websites are a no-go.
So far we have been essentially syncing them manually, via a shared folder that new photos are placed to and collected from. This is laborious and prone to errors, that usually leave one of us without all the photos without even knowing.
Have you tried Dropbox? It offers shared folders which integrate seamlessly with your desktop file browser. It's pretty fast, since everything is cached locally on your hard drive, as well as being accessible on the web. You would need the $9.99/month package or above for each user though since you need a lot of space.
