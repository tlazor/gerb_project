This is what worked for me. I suspected my BCD file was what was causing Windows update to always give me a "Something Went Wrong" message so I downloaded EasyBCD from Neosmart at www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/easybcd.html. (Other sites require you to download something called "Inbox" so I didn't use those sites.)  I ended up also purchasing Easy Recovery Essentials from Neosmart for $19.95 because that is needed.   I put EasyRE onto a USB thumb drive before running EasyBCD.   I ran EasyBCD and deleted my BCD file. (The reason I deleted it is that I couldn't edit it so it was my only choice since I suspected that was the problem.)  After deleting it I couldn't boot Windows so that is where the EasyRE was needed. I put in the thumb drive and rebooted. EasyRE booted right up and proceeded to install a new BCD.   I restarted my PC and not only did it boot up but this time when I ran Windows update it worked. No error messages!    I will note though, it did take almost and hour and a half to complete the year and a half of updates.
So try to disconnect all non-elementary USB devices, and reduce your screen resolution to 1024x768. Then try it again. Once it is successfully installed, change the screen back to what you had, and plug everything back in, there should be no issues.
I had very similar situations several times, and each time it went away when I removed some external devices and removed my 4k screen.
