Are there other brands of wifi routers which have better support for firewalling between the WiFi and Ethernet devices?
On "BT Voyager" router all the devices connected to the router can talk to each other, even with a firewall rule of "block all protocols from all addresses to all addresses, inbound and outbound".  Presumably its firewall only applies to connections going via the broadband/phone line?
DD-WRT is a replacement firmware for many consumer level routers. To install it, you actually flash your router with the new firmware. It isn't for the faint of heart, as there is a real possibility of making your device not start up again. The risks are usually outweighed by the benefits, because a router with ddwrt can do vlan tagging, custom policies and so much more. 
Use a dedicated firewall. If you have an old computer lying around, install one of the following OS's on it, and you can easily create business level firewall rules
