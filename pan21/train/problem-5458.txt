No.  However, if you want devices in a VLAN to communicate with one another they will likely need some L3 protocol.
3.I am aware that a VLAN can exist within a subnet but my understanding is that you would have to assign the VLAN an IP address of that subnet. How can it be isolated from the rest of the subnet?
5.I keep coming across the point that Virtual local area networks (VLANs) allow us to create different logical and physical networks; whereas IP subnetting simply allows us to create logical networks through the same physical network. however am unsure what this exactly means when it reads same physical network.
1.If I have multiple subnets I assume that you would need a router to communicate between each subnet. Only devices within each subnet would be in the local broadcast domain for that subnet. Is that right?
IP Networks (subnets) are a layer 3 concept.  If two PC's are attached to the same L2 switch without VLAN's they will be in the same L2 broadcast domain, but not L3 broadcast domain.
