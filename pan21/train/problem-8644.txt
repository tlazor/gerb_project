Built-in Windows drivers only report their build date as 2006, this is done so that if an driver is supplied by a manufacturer and listed to support the device you have then it will be preferred over the built-in driver supplied with Windows.
You should use the driver that is provided by your manufacturer out of preference. If they don't supply a driver then you can assume the Windows built-in driver is "safe".
For more read the Microsoft Engineer blog Why are all Windows drivers dated June 21, 2006? Donâ€™t you ever update drivers? by Raymond Chen.
It works this way under the assumption that if you install a specific device driver then you will always use that driver instead under the assumption that you knew what you were doing.
That doesn't necessarily mean that the driver you install is "better".  The ones supplied with Windows may actually be newer or more complete.
Just because they are dated 2006 doesn't mean that that was when they were designed or built. They could have had an update last week, but been given a date of 2006.
