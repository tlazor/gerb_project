The tablet ships with Microsoft Office Mobile; however, because it has a screen size of exactly 10.1 inches, it seems that the version of Office Mobile that it ships with allows for reading, but not creating or editing Word documents (only devices with a screen size of less than 10.1 inches have editing capabilities).
Yes, you can.  The ASUS Transformer Mini is a full PC with the capability of running Microsoft Office, as well as any other Windows software.  It is not the most powerful machine, but is more than capable of handling MS office.  To answer your second question,  you can copy the installation media to a USB drive and install it that way.
Yes, definitely if the tablet is windows yes, but if windows exp probably not your gonna have to crack it (Not literally) But just search up an apk for office 2016 and it will pop up, be sure to include your system details but not personal ones ;)
FYI, Office Mobile is simply a "convenience" application.  It only allows for viewing Office documents.  
My research so far has led me to believe that Office Mobile and Office 365 are the only versions of Microsoft Office that can run on tablet devices, and that the desktop Office 2016 suite is incompatible with my device even though my device also functions as a PC. At best, the information out there on this is confusing.
So if you device also works as a PC, you will be able to install it just fine. It just won't be optimized for touch and smaller screens. 
I already have the desktop media for Office 2016 at hand. Can I simply load this media onto a USB drive to install the Office 2016 suite to my tablet, or will my only option be to subscribe to and use the cloud-based Office 365 suite?
I recently obtained an ASUS Transformer Mini, which is characterised as a 2-in-1 laptop and tablet PC, runs Windows 10, and which I mainly intended to use for creating and editing Microsoft Word documents.
