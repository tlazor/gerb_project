Your thought that it might be the SATA cables is a good one. Try replacing them, and make sure they're rated for SATA 3.0 Gb/sec (also called "SATA 2" or "SATA II"). I don't think your drives are the problem. Why does it take several months for the errors to show up after you replace the drive? Maybe the cables are coming loose somehow and replacing the drive reseats them. Or maybe it's just random chance.
It looks like you have a lot of errors on your SATA link. As a result, the host cannot get commands reliably across the link, and when it does sometimes the data returned is corrupted.
You see that in messages that the speed is limited, or that the expected drive identifier was not received. You are also seeing confusing messages from different layers of the driver which don't necessarily reflect what is going on at the hardware level of SATA. For example, "limiting speed to UDMA/133:PIO3" strictly applies only to parallel ATA drives (it just means the driver is trying a slower interface speed to see if the errors clear up), but the error messages clearly indicate that the lowest level which actually deals with the hardware understands it's talking to a SATA drive.
