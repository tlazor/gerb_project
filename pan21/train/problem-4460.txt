Not to say this couldn't be done with the Thunderbolt standard (which actually uses the same connector as Mini-DP) and the right device/drivers, but as is, the Mini-DisplayPort port is meant to output one video signal to one display.
The D shaped female connector on your Dell PC is called DMS-59, or Dual Monitor Solution -59 pin.  Although it is not a proprietary Dell solution, it is specifically designed to support two monitors from a single DMS-59 output on a half-height video card.  A full height video card could fit two of these connectors, allowing connection of a total of four DVI monitors.
To my knowledge, there is no way to connect DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort to more than one monitor.  If such a thing even exists, it's more than likely going to be more expensive than the alternative, which is to purchase a USB to DVI adapter dongle to supply the second monitor signal previously mentioned by others in this thread.
That splitter uses a proprietary connection to a Dell video card.  As far as I know, it only works with Dell computers that support dual monitors.  I don't think there's any way to split a single Mini-DisplayPort signal out to two monitors, certainly not to provide dual monitor functionality.
