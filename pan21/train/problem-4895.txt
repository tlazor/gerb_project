Thus, to have different screens, just create a new class that extends com.badlogic.gdx.Screen. You can do this for any number of screens you need (e.g., MainMenuScreen, GameScreen). Whenever you need to switch screens (e.g., going from Main Menu -> Game), you can just call the setScreen function from your game.
The easiest way to accomplish this would be to do the following. You should have a .java file in your -core project named after your game name. It would be a class extending ApplicationListener. Now, change it to extend Game instead, which should be in the package com.badlogic.gdx. If you look at the logic of the Game class, you will see it has a setScreen function. Once a Screen has been set, it simply passes all the method calls like render() and resize() to a given screen.
The reason why you should take this approach, and not mess with the manifest.xml and adding additional activities, is because in this way your game is cross-platform. Your main menu will not just be specific to the Android build, and can be used across desktop, ios, and html too.
If you are using LibGDX, you need to forego the concept of Activities and Views, since your entire game will now just be a single Activity. To have a main menu when you game starts up doesn't switch the Activity, but just presents a different set of objects to be rendered to the same Activity.
