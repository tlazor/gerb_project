That being said, these are bizarre solutions.  I modded up the NetLimiter answer, but is anyone doing anything like this in a big enterprise environment?  Would love to hear stories if it works well.
More in your ballpark, but still requires some infrastructure, is modifying a Group Policy, if you have an Active Directory Domain, is modifying Group Policy settings under Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Network -> QoS Packet Scheduler -> Limit reservable bandwidth.  As the policy setting description states:
This also requires you get intimately acquanited with WMI filters in said GPO's for your time requirement, but I am not sure they are that reliable (in terms of on the dime processing at a given time, since refresh rates, IMHO, are quite variable in larger, poorly-maintained domains common to big companies like I deal with).
I was curious myself if Windows has an "in-house" way of doing this.  Apparently, a part of SCCM, called Data Protection Manager partly offers what you are looking for, if I understand it correctly.  That requires you have much more enterprise infrastructure than just a Windows XP box, so I cannot be certain that is even an option.
