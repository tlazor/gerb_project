For stuff that doesn't fall into that category - you may find a local geek community might have a use for it for 'playing with' in a workshop/hack space. Advertise it on freecycle or equivalent maybe? 
I have old and completely worthless routers/modules that are rotting in my office closet from various data center upgrades. I doubt anyone would want to buy this stuff (feel free to contact me otherwise), and even if I sold it, I'd probably spend more money shipping it. The inventory consists of a bunch of Cisco 3725's, 2651XM's, Pix525's, a vast array of corresponding modules and switches, and a plethora of 3.65 wireless radios and other manner of gear. Before I make several trips to the dumpster, I just wanted to know what everyone else does with old stuff like this. I'm sure someone somewhere can make use of this junk, or I can monetize it some other way either by way of tax write-off or something.
Depends a bit - for anything potentially holding commercially sensitive material, it's properly destroyed. (Shred/furnace). It's just not worth the risk of it being recoverable.
