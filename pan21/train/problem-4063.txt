This may be a strange problem. I have a primary/standby Exchange 2010 pair. The standby is a clone of the primary after the Exchange installation. The standby is running and connected to the primary through a private NIC. But not to the LAN. Any data wrt Exchange coming in to the primary will be copied to the standby through the private connection. But the Exchange on the standby would not run; the services are switched off. So if I need to switch over, I up the exchange on the standby, down it on primary, change the network cable (of LAN) from primary to standby. It works for me. I have handled all the other implications. 
Is AD LDS worth a try? What I mean here is planting a dummy AD on the standby machine, kicking it off when the server acts as a standby and stopping the AD LDS when the server changes mode to primary. Is it possible to change the AD the exchange points to to the local one? This may make the stand by believe that it could see an AD. But I don't know how to do it. Any thoughts?
But the problem is with patching the Exchange on the standby server. I can get the patches through the Primary server; no problem. But the installation fails complaining that the server can't see the DC. Does anybody have an idea to work this around?
