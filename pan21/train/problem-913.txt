You can tell that sdb is the usb stick from its size (16GB). It's fine if you see multiple partitions below it (sdb1, sdb2 etc) we only care about the sdb disk itself. So once you make sure which disk is your usb stick, replace sdb below:
Assuming that doesn't help, the final solution is to null the table and set up a new one, effectively resetting the usb stick completely. But, mistyping the command could lead to accidentally deleting your internal HDD instead. From within Ubuntu, open up a terminal and sudo su, then lsblk. You'll see a list of the detected disks and partitions:
When you formatted the memory stick in Ubuntu, did you also set up a new MS-DOS partition table? Windows gets glitchy if the stick has a partition table it doesn't know about, or even multiple partitions on most usb sticks. Giving it a brand new partition table will probably do it.
Now take the stick out and plug it back in, open up gparted, set up an msdos partition table and make a FAT32 partition like before. Should be good!
