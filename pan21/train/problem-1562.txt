Long answer: Any organization which uses fonts of any kind usually does not create the font themselves.  They hire someone else to create the font and then package it with their product.  In smaller enterprises, this is usually a one-time thing and a permanent change.  In larger enterprises, this can be more complex, with expiration dates existing similar to the rights on background music in an advertisement or training video.  When that happens, the next version of the software usually has its fonts modified to reflect whoever won a new contract bid to make the font. 
That doesn't discount other issues, though.  Most of the changes come from simple versioning of the fonts due to UI choices.  Windows 10 ships with version 6.96 of the font.  This is actually not the same version as the one used on Mac.  There is more information available here.
Short answer: yes, they changed it, and have before, across many versions of software and operating systems. There are even versions of TNR that are different between applications on the same operating system (i.e. WinXP using Encarta).
