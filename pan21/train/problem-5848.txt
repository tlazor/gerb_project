If you simply need to have a gateway outside your subnet - Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 have the powershell cmdlets to enable direct access outside the subnet, the "Get-NetOffloadGlobalSetting" shows the current state, and "Set-NetOffloadGlobalSetting -NetworkDirectAcrossIPSubnets" allows you to configure the value. Althought PowerShell understands the syntax of the "NetworkDirectAcrossIPSubnets" on client operating systems, this feature is available for servers only, setting it under a client OS will give an error.
"169.254.1.0" by itself is not a network. Usually 169.254.0.0/16 is used for link-local addresses, though according to your comments, your network uses 169.254.1.0/24.
A workaroud can be, if both networks are connected to the same physical ethernet network, add a second ip address to your computer in the second ip subnet. But doing so makes you unable to use DHCP; all IP addresses must be fixed.
You say that these hosts are on the same link (connected to the same switch). Which is good, since the 169.254.0.0/16 range is defined as "link-local" and explicitly forbidden from being routed. (Some routers allow this, but most will refuse to forward packets from/to this network.)
Now if the setup is less simple and it is not a switch, but there are one or more routers in between then you may have a problem.  RFC1918 IPs are not supposed to be routable. Thus if there are any router in between you will need to reconfigure them. If there are third party routers (e,g, the headless boxes are in another office and you try to reach them via the Internet) then give up. Try something different. (e.g. first VPN to a box in that office, or log into the router in the other office).
You need a router between those two networks. In route command gateway must be in same subnet that peer ip address. So router must have, at least, two addresses. For instance 10.10.1.1 and 169.254.1.0.
