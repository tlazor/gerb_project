So animations such as small explosions of a projectile can be shown, if they are identical whether or not they hit a player.  But animations describing a hit on a player might be better off delayed, if it is important to players that these are always correct.
For this reason, sometimes crucial feedback such as death-animations, frag count, player health, are not automatically updated/projected on the client; instead the client must wait for updates/triggers from the server, before such things are shown.  The delay this necessarily causes is seen as a better payoff than showing the client false information.
You got the right idea about cheating.  Only the server should decide what really happened, with the information he has.  The clients must defer to whatever the server says, and throw away any wrong information they have.
You have identified the key problems.  Your "bounding box" solution to what-to-update seems fine.  You may want to make the update box a little wider than the view box, so that actors outside the view are already available if your player starts walking.
