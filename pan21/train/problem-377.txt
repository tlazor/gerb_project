But you need to be aware that the age group is problematic, having little realization of the consequences of their actions. The older students can be expected to behave a bit better, but even those have only the beginnings of adult sensibilities. 
Get the parents more involved, with a signed paper from them that their child is responsible for damage and they will be assessed a fee if necessary. Contact the parents for any willful damage when noticed. 
While it is probably unrealistic that some students will "report" misdeeds of others, it is possible that you can encourage a few "influencers" in the group to positively change the bad behavior of others through word and action. That is, have a "team" of responsible students speak to others when poor behavior is imminent. 
Have a session in which the students are actually asked to think up the worst thing they could do with the equipment. The intent here is to get their "creative destruction" impulses out in the open but in a harmless way. When they come up with "ideas" have them speculate on appropriate punishments for the various transgressions. 
Charge every student a "deposit fee" that will be returned at the end of the class if there is no damage. If you can't asses damage against individuals, only a fraction of the deposit is returned after deducting a damage assessment. But be prepared for an accurate accounting of the funds. 
Have students work in pairs and make the pair responsible for their equipment. You should probably assign the pairs so that Beavis and Butt-Head don't choose to work together. Maybe exploit age differences to choose good pairs, with the more responsible students guiding the others.
