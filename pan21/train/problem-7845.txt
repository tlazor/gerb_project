Is the use of a public IP on the LAN side of the router because the router is effectively outside of our LAN?
Public IP addresses are globally visible. Your ISP provided you with a set of public IP addresses which should be behind their end modem (because their routing tables). Any device that you want to be publicly visible should be in that LAN, if you don't use some kind of inbound NAT.
I am a relative newcomer to networking (and my current employer), and want to understand whether our present set up is okay, or not.
We have 8 static IPs provided by our ISP. We have a Windows SBS 2003 server with 2 NICs - one on the public side, with one of our static IP addresses; and one on the LAN with a number in the 192.168.100.nnn range. This all seems normal for SBS 2003.
Yes, that is normal. The WAN side of your router will have IP addressing that your ISP uses in it's own network - probably a just a /30. The LAN side of your router will have your public address range on it. Your ISP will then route your public address range at the WAN IP of your router, allowing you to use your own public address space on the LAN side of your router.
The SBS is used as our gateway and has an ISA firewall running on it. The router/modem, on the public side of the SBS, shows its LAN IP as being another one of our static public IP addresses. On the WAN side of the router, the IP is, as expected, a public number, but not within our range. I can only assume that this was also provided by our ISP, and will be asking them as such.
If you are saying that you have a public (WAN Interface) and private (LAN interface) address on a router, then the setup is correct.
