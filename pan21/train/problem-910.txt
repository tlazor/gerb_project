Everything about your question tells me that you should never ever ever let your coders store CC data. you guys are no where close to where you need to be to handle that data securely. 
it is NOT for protecting data from an app that has been written and configured to access that very data. keep in mind, attacks on your infrastructure proxied through one of your applications use that applications credentials and privileges to perform the attack. its like giving your housekey to your lowlife bother-in-law so he can dogsit, but expecting him not to be able to steal your TV. Even if you did your encryption at the app tier, the app has the keys to teh encryption, so any attackers do as well. the only real option is to tie the keys to the users, not the app itself, so that no user could ever decrypt cc data that was not their own. 
Second, in order to legally store credit card data, you must meet industry PCI standards for security, which are well beyond the scope of this forum. 
Edit: I note you have removed all references to credit cards from your OP, so if that is not your goal, disregard my comments on PCI standards. My comments on SQLServer encryption remain valid.
SQL Server encryption is for protecting data at rest, to protect backup files and prevent someone from accessing the database data files in a raw format.
