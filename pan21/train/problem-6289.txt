Editing the isc-dhcp-server configuration is easily done via the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file. Within your subnet declaration, you will find the option for DNS nameservers as doled out by DHCP for that subnet. Change this there. don't forget to restart or config reload the isc-dhcp-server to use the new configuration.
Editing the DHCP configuration of cobbler is pretty easy, but you must first identify which DHCP server you're using as a cobbler module. That information is stored in /etc/cobbler/modules.conf. There you will find either the ISC-DHCP server module set for DHCP, or the dnsmasq module set in its stead. Focus on the DHCP module, not the DNS one.
Yes, if you change that file on the clients, it will be re-generated by NetworkManager. The same would be true of any network that sends DNS nameserver information along with addresses via DHCP, not just cobbler.
Dnsmasq can be changed similarly, via the file /etc/dnsmasq.conf (or similar, as it varies more from distribution to distribution). On the DNS= line, make your edit there. As before, reload the dnsmasq service.
