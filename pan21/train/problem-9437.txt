It is possible that your thermal compound is dry, try to change it. You can go to a computer service, or you can guide yourself from youtube videos to learn how to dissasembly your laptop.
I have the very same Asus machine as you and am encountering exactly the same problem, just as you described it. Something to do with the display adapter is my suspicion. Like you I live in a very hot country (Borneo, Malaysia 4 degrees from the equator). I think the layout on the motherboard might be responsible as All those hot components are very close together. I am a graphics designer and media consultant and when I use video or graphical software, or even view graphically intense video material through the internet, this power failure is most likely to occur. I have tried many solutions but nothing works so far. Technicians have checked every component on the laptop and can find nothing wrong. The power failure is not very often, and very intermittent. But my view is that it should NEVER happen. I have lost files for clients I was working on because of this and had to redo the work. Have you checked your battery? I recently replaced the battery and the instances of failure greatly reduced. I think batteries wear out sooner on this machine due to the heat. It runs much hotter than my other laptop (Sony Vaio). 
Also try to clean the dust from intake and outake vents of your laptop. The use of cooling pads is not always a successful solution because the fans dont match with intake laptop vents, you can try Cooler Master NotePal U3 because fans can be placed anywhere on the cooling pad.
Have you installed your drivers from Windows update or from the OEM? Check your Power Plan, you might wanna try setting the maximum processor speed from the default 100% to lower (happened to me, I can only reach 80% without overheating)
