If it does work, you might want to find the place where your phone accumulates the amount of data transfered and reset it; using this accumulator you can track how much you use (my data plan is limited to 5Gb per month).
You probably should have a data plan already; otherwise, I imagine the cellular provider would take a very dim view of your activites...
I should add: one sure way to go over the limit is to stream constantly - whether with BitTorrent or with streaming audio/video - you'll go over a 5Gb limit in no time.
Depending on the phone yes, but be careful with your cell phone plan. Many providers detect phone-as-modem and will charge you a pretty penny if you do not have a plan that covers it. Might want to see if others online have tried it with your model and plan and see if they get charged. Play it safe and don't torrent as well, they often ding you either way for massive downloads in short periods (10gb a month or more).
I want to connect my laptop to internet using my mobile phone. unfortunately the laptop I have now has no bluetooth. And mobile phone has no wifi...
Actually, I've done it in the past.  It depends on the phone - I know that the Samsung Caliber can do it.
