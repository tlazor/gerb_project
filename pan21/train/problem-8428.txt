Have you explored satellite and wireless mesh options - maybe there's one in your area if the local xDSL services are not too hot.
I work for an organization that is spread out over the county in our state. To connect all the buildings we pay for fiber connections that run to each of the buildings, so we have one Internet connection and share it to all of our buildings bridged via fiber. High speed, and all we pay for is renting the previously dark fiber and the poles on which it's run. Depending on how far away you are, it may be cheaper than what you're paying and you'll get a significantly faster speed, but you'll have to run the numbers and check what it'll cost for you to get a business class connection that can be resold and you'll have to deal with the phone company...not usually a fun proposition. This may be a drastic option (and you'd need to take some precautions to separate this from your work life, since you don't know what the future will hold) but you'll have really fast speeds and you may be able to monitor systems at work from home. If that's a bonus. I don't know.
My solution is simply: remote desktop/other remote access application to your home computer. You could work with the files, read the files, and even print the files if you needed to. If you needed to have the files on the network for whatever reason, you could just do it at the end of the day, keep a log of what files need to be transferred and throw them on a portable storage. The only problems in that are:
Write up an agreement with your employer and see if you can resell your FIOS connection (or make an arrangement to do so as a business customer.) Have fiber connected from your home to your employer.
