BitLocker provides Full Disk Encryption with multiple ways to secure the encryption keys. One way is using a TPM chip, which is commonly part of the motherboard (though some computers use an LPC Bus to attach the chip). If your motherboard already has TPM then it can store the encryption key.
As others have pointed out, once the system is running, Windows is somewhat oblivious to the encryption. If you configure the OS so that there are no access controls preventing someone from looking at files, then the files will not be protected. BitLocker prevents someone from taking the drives and having anything useful, it does not protect the drives from the OS as configured.
That said, Bitlocker doesn't really seem like a good choice if they're going to have physical access to the machine, since once it's running the data is decrypted. I, personally, would never deploy a server in my environment that was encrypted with a key that I didn't have. 
I think what you want is to issue standard NDAs to your clients. You seem to have a policy/licensing problem, not a technical one. 
Even if they aren't allowed to log in to the machine (which is another turn off), they could just use wget/curl to get all web content on the server and parse it on another machine. You're not really protecting anything. 
When initializing BitLocker you are prompted to save or print a recovery key. This is using in case TPM cannot provide the key (most commonly because someone messed with BIOS settings, Windows startup settings, or did a BIOS upgrade). 
Without the Recovery Key moving the hard drive to another machine, or messing with the way the computer boots, will render the drive unreadable. Protect that Recovery Key or you're asking to be locked out of the system at some point.
