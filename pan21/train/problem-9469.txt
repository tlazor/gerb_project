EC2 allows you to setup your machines with different SSH certificates that you can create, the easiest solution for you would be to just create one that requires a password.
You will need to secure access to the EC2 console with two-factor. There you are at the mercy of Amazon.  For SSH access, you can do lots of options.  You can do SSH keys and require that the keys have a password. However, note that there is nothing to keep someone from writing an SSH client that lies about the cert having a password.  SSH is great from a security PoV, but it doesn't always pass muster for regulatory requirements. For example, the keys might need to be re-generated periodically. SSH doesn't support that.
Also be aware of the security limitations of EC2, the security is peripheral and you don't know which machines are doing what inside so place strict security to communicate between machines, some strong encryption VPN (OpenVPN or stunnel) is highly desired for this.
With duo_unix, you can add two-factor authentication for any SSH login method, and with the Duo OpenVPN integration, you can add two-factor authentication to OpenVPN.
