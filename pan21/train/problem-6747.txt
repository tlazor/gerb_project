"Also, I want to install Load Balancer but I don't know where should I put it, behind routers/switches or Firewall?"
The VLAN setup you've shown will do some balancing on it's own, but I do wonder if the perceived benefit of that many VLANs is balanced by the setup and maintenance for them. You don't mention how many geo-locations are shown here, but that is another way to think of segmenting your network. 
ATT usually hands off their network as a private address. You may be able to use layer 3 switches in place of the routers and do a combined core and distribution at those switches if the network isn't very big. It can save money, you can stack most with a modules or special cables, you get fast routing, less chance of bottle necks than "router on a stick" and give you more ports. Just be sure you don't need complex routing and they meet your routing needs. Normally, your distribution layer would connect to two routers if your doing a first hop redundancy protocol like hsrp, vrrp or glbp. But, if you do the combined core/distribution design you will connect your access layer switched to both layer three switches but since they are stacked you wouldn't necessarily need vrrp. You could create your gateways at the vlan interface (svis) and put the vlan s on the uplink ports (one on each switch). Again, this depends on the size of network and your routing needs. I have set up many networks this way. 
You can get more information from the documentation pages at f5.com, or Cisco's docwiki.cisco.com, perhaps thinking up some options will lead you to the best fit.  
As Ron Trunk mentioned, you didn't specify what you want to do with the load balancer.  If you are using it for a combination of traffic and redundancy, then in-line behind the firewall would allow traffic to flow smoothly and offer alternative routes in the event of an outage.
