I'm shopping for a half-height or low-profile video card. I notice that newegg has categories for both "low profile" and "low profile ready". I assume this is an actual classification of expansion card and not just a newegg category.
Low profile ready card comes with a standard bracket and will fit into a standard size slot. A low profile bracket is included with the card if you want to install it in a low profile system. It's usually 2 or 3 screws with nuts that hold the bracket onto the card.
In my experience, "low profile" means the card itself and the metal slot cover on the edge of the card both come in the "low profile" form factor out of the box.  "low profile ready" usually means the card is low profile...but the slot cover might not be.  If the vendor is nice, they'll include a low profile slot cover that you can switch to.  But you might also have to get one separately.
Low profile cards are "half height" cards, the smaller bracket on them will not fit into a standard size slot.
