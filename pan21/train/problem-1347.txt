The ItemIDs should probably be a number/alphanumeric ofc.  Then, you just crosstab w/ Atrributes as column headers when necessary to generate the tables like you like.  This also allows for better queries for things like "Show me all items that are from Alpha Centauri" which could give you back the Alien and also the Meteorite fragment that contained the plague that wipes out mankind (it's coming.....)
Replace the 400+ tables with one.  Only need 3 fields (+1 autonumber or whatever primary key if you want it, don't have to have it you can form it out of the other fields)
Optimization may be tricky depending on how many records there are but it's a much better way to design this.  I did the same for a database that contained a bunch of recipes (10k+) that had few overlaps.  Worked well in that case.  Didn't have any speed problems really.  Yours may be harder depending on how many you are dealing with.  
So where in your other tables each field represents an attribute, in this table your attributes are all in one field.  You would have something like this
