I can find the kind of splitter I think I need online, but I'm unsure whether they are just for output or can also do input/output.
On the box it says "some phones and computers may need additional adapters," so I'm hoping it is possible to get a splitter or something for this to work properly.  I did email the parent company (http://dglusa.com/) but I haven't heard from them, and, looking over their website, I doubt I will.  I also went to the local radio shack, and the guy said I needed a splitter, but he didn't know where to get one.  
I recently bought the :Hype Retro Handset for Mobile Phone" -- its just a device that looks like a handset to use when chatting on a computer or mobile phone that plugs into the phone/computer with a single 3.5 mm plug.  I was hoping to use it on my windows 7 Toshiba laptop.  I can hear audio fine through the handset but what I'm saying is not being picked up on the handset.  
You can purchase an adapter at Radio Shack, Amazon, and likely many other places. This Google search offers up many examples of the correct product that you can buy from a variety of locations. Please note that you want the choices from that list that have one hole, and two jacks; not the choices that have one jack with two holes.
