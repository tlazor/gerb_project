I'm a developer at my organization, but I've been tasked with resetting the passwords on 10k e-mail users in an OU in Active Directory. I was given the proper permissions, then sent the following TechNet article, but I'm not sure where I'd run this or how exactly it works. I apologize if this question is too vague, but I wasn't sure where else I could ask (I'd ask a sysadmin at my organization, but it'd take a while for response). Could someone give me a rundown of what exactly this cmdlet does and how I'd go about executing this?
I think bulk resetting 10k passowords is not good idea. Simply we can choose option "change at next logon" It will ensure that we are not breaking any Information Security policy or process.
I just want to throw this out there and say this is a horrible idea. If the need to change 10K user passwords is present, a bulk reset should not be part of the process. At best, simply forcing a change next time a user logs on would prevent the gigantic security hole you are opening.
