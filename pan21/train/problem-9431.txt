If your glusterfs bricks reside on LVM logical volumes, then you should be able to simply resize the LV and the filesystem on it, and the gluster clients should see the new larger size immediately without any gluster-specific steps required.  Assuming "lvmhome" in your example is the LV being used for the bricks, and you want to grow it by 2GB, you should be able to do this by running "lvextend --resizefs --size +2G /dev/vg10/lvmhome".  This is a non-destructive operation, and you can do this while the filesystem is online and in use.  Once you've run this on both of the gluster servers, the clients should see the new larger gluster volume.
I have setup GlusterFS (3.5.3) replicated volumes on top of LVM on two identical Ubuntu 14.04 servers(vmware workstation). they are working fine.i want to know how to reload the gluster brick/volume information on gluster server/client when the Logical volume is increased equally on both servers to scale out the Glusterfs. heres my output for gluster volume info
