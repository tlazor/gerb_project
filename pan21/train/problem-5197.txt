From the photo you've posted, the easiest thing I can think of is adding a physical switch or relay between the LED boards and the camera board. It's just a positive and ground connection on each side, so it shouldn't be too complicated to rig a couple of bits of perfboard or similar between the sections to allow you to switch the LEDs off. 
To the best of my knowledge the CSI camera connector's 3.3V pin is connected directly to the Pi's 3.3V pin. There's no way of shutting that off in software. 
An inspection of the published schematics will show that the 3.3V is directly connected to the camera.
Inless the camera module includes some power control, there is no way of controlling it from the Pi.
My colleague has solved this problem by powering the LEDs not from the camera module but from the Raspberry's GPIO pins, enabling/disabling them when needed by a Python script - I think there is a multitude of other ways to control GPIO outs. The downside to this is that you'll need a bit of additional wiring, and the LEDs have to be separate from the camera module, or you should put some non-conducting material between the LED and camera modules if you want to keep them physically connected.
