Many MFP/Copiers have a Lisc activation to use features such as PostScript printing, scanning etc..  
UFR II is the 2nd version of UFR... which stands for "Ultra Fast Renderer".  In short... it's similar to PCL in concept... but alien in the actual instructions.  Most commonly associated with Canon printers.  PCL is more generic, common, and simple, but antiquated... UFR II is better designed, and faster, but not anywhere near as common.  If you have a printer and driver that both are geared towards UFR II... use it.  If not... PCL is a lot more forgiving.
The UFRII print driver is close to 2.5 times faster than either the PS or PCL drivers (hence the name Ultra Fast Rendering). In most printing environments, the UFRII drivers work fine. Two known examples of PS or PCL being the preferred print driver are; if an AS400 is being used as a print server (PCL) or in the case when high quality graphics is being printed (PS). 
A new printer recently showed up at work. There are an abundance of possible drivers for it applicable to my system (Windows 7, 64 bit) including PCL5, PCL5e, PCL6 and UFR II.
I'm familiar with PCL, but not UFR II, although the ever-helpful Wikipedia told me it stands for "Ultra Fast Rendering".
UFRII print drivers are written by Canon for Canon MFDs. All Canons have the ability to print with the UFRII driver right out of the box. The PS and PCL drivers will not work unless the appropriate PS or PCL print kit is installed on the MFD. These print kits can be purchased and installed by your Canon dealer.
Canon's use the UFR driver, If the machine does not have PCL or PS Lisc installed / activated in the machine, an error will occur when attempting to print to the machine.
