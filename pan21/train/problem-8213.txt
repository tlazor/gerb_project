Also the TOC or filesystem on a disk, if written in the most inner part of CD/DVD would be better protected and allow at least reading partial data from the rest of the CD. But I haven't checked exact position of this data on the different disk types and writing modes so I don't know if it is written like that.
With the data starting from the center, and scratches more likely toward the edges, scratches are more likely to happen on part of the disk that contains no data, so the scratch has no effect on reading the data.
Other answers are good. I read somewhere though that damage to disks happen most often and more severe on the outer part than on the inner part.
Along with reasons that have already been cited, back when CDs were new, there was also some discussion of the fact that scratches from normal handling were a lot more likely to happen toward the edges of the disk than toward the center (especially those from misalignment when putting a disk into a disk tray).
If this is true, that would have meant for CDs that they will have better durability. Rarely commercial CDs are written full. Damage to the unwritten part of the CD would be irrelevant.
