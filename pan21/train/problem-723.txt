This can happen if your machine has a hostname/IP-address that cannot be both forward and reverse looked-up according to your local name resolver setup.  InetAddress.getLocalHost() is known to perform reverse lookups to resolve the local host.
Note that the Jenkins JVM will cache hostname lookups, so it pays to have a small test program to make the test call to InetAddress.getLocalHost(), otherwise you should restart Jenkins after each configuration change you test.
Since I don't control the source for the release plugin other than changeing the code is there some way to work around this issue? Can I setup my etc hosts in some way to force specific response from "InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()"? 
Run the hostname command, and make sure that you have an entry matching your real IP address to that name in /etc/hosts.  It may be that hostname is returning either the FQDN hostname or the alias/short hostname, and that these cannot be forward/reverse looked-up.
I'm assuming that your XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is masking an actual, non-localhost (or localhost variant/alias) hostname.
