Finally in terms of organization and inventory, we order the tapes with our labels already printed on them. You scan the barcodes, note where the tape is and you're done with it. 
All that being said MAKE SURE YOU USE GOOD BACKUP SOFTWARE with your tape library. The way the metadata about backup sets is kept and especially the RECOVERY aspect of the software is VERY important when you need it. EMC Networker is the only one I've used thus far and the recovery function is pretty awful. 
Also, as mentioned above the autoloading/form factor aspect is important, you can load up a tape library magazine with tapes and let enormous backups run on them, pulling out tapes as they get full. With the exception of a SAN you generally just don't physically have enough storage ports on a server to do the same thing efficiently, nor an appropriate standard operating protocol to turn off and hotswap drives, it would be an ad-hoc thing. 
I don't know of any similar solution for hard drives except if you were to scan the serial number barcodes, which are much smaller and more prone to be rubbed off.
