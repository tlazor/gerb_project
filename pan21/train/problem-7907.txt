Be aware that SMB file sharing will mean one TCP session to one IP address, so you'll need to load balance based on IP, and each client will be load balanced to a specific NIC.
I doubt you can, but in your edit 2 where you mention splitting the two teams as two half-duplex parts of a full duplex connection, we wary of doing that as it could potentially open you up to a single point of failure depending upon how the links are configured.
suprjami is probably right though, it's probably easiest to just upgrade the switch to something that supports more than 2x1Gb LACP.  He's also spot on about pointing out that a single session will never use more bandwidth than a single link in the LACP trunk can provide, so in a 4x1Gb or 2x1Gb LACP configuration, individual sessions will be limited to 1Gb.  That's not necessarily a problem if you're trying to service a bunch of clients, but if you have a single client and are trying to get 2Gb of throughput to it, it won't work that way.
If you must have 4Gb, I'd look at setting up a pair of 2x1Gb LACP trunks and giving each one it's own IP.  Then you could do something like round robin DNS for that server's hostname.  It wouldn't give you a perfect bandwidth distribution but it's a relatively easy and simple solution that would get you more than what you've got now.
