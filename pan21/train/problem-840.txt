Anyway, the question is, has this kind of category-theoretic reasoning been investigated in the literature? It currently seems like abstract nonsense, but perhaps it is indicative of something deeper.
What's more is that this functor preserves coproducts. Indeed the coproduct of two graphs is given by the disjoint union of the graphs, and the chromatic number of this graph is the maximum of the chromatic number of the two graphs. I'm unsure if it preserves more general colimits, but I think at least if they are small then it should be ok.
I was fooling around with some concept and was wondering if this viewpoint is explored at all. Let INJ-GRAPH be the subcategory of graphs (with morphisms as homomorphisms) whose morphisms consist only of the graph homomorphisms which are injective as sets. Then clearly for such a homomorphism $f : G \to H$ of graphs, the chromatic number of $H$ is at least as large as the chromatic number of $G$. Thus one gets a covariant functor from INJ-GRAPH to the order category of $\mathbb{N}$ (i.e. the category whose objects are natural numbers and there is a unique arrow $a \to b$ if and only if $a \leq b$)
