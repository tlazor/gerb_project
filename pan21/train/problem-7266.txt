They do not pay royalties to the designers, use hacked software or microchips, avoid TAX'es and usually come with 1 year "silent" warranty- In other words, you will be lucky if you get a reply when things go bad
Caveat emptor "Let the buyer beware". Does sound too good to be true. But the only way you will find out is to try. Can you afford for them to fail and have to buy new ones?
I would advise you to buy from a reputed seller locally since you have the option to replace it or obtain warranty later on if something happens to your Pi. 
None. Not even in packaging or in documentation. Same box with the same contents. The other was 60 euros, the latter 32 euros.
My friends who acquired a china-Pi have had absolutely no complaints at all, and I haven't seen any signs of "lower" quality on them. The only ones in my peer and friend network who had complaints about china-bought Pi's are the ones who 1) haven't owned or worked with any Pi's at all and the ones who 2) bought their Pi's from Finland for twice the china-Pi's price :)
Since you're from Czech Republic I would highly recommend this shop. They sell the RPI2 for about 40 USD. Very professional and enthusiastic. I bought my RPI2 from them. Website is in Czech but you can email Mr. Prenner your queries in English.
Personally I have had good experiences ordering things from China through eBay, cheap price work as expected, quick delivery. But they items are often noticeably lower quality than I would expect for the full prices item.
If you really support the Raspberry Pi community it is worth buying locally and paying a few dollars more. Not only does it directly support the charity, it supports your local business and global trade, while supporting 3rd party licenses, like h264.
