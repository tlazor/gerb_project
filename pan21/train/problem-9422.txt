Set up a trigger collider (or more than one) to completely encompass the aperture of your hole. Then add this script to the GameObject containing these triggers.
After reading through this site, I began to think on how could I remove the colliders of vertexes with a transparent texture on it? I had read a suggestion  (forgot where it was) to disable the whole terrain collider, but I also have NPC's, so having them plumet through the map wouldn't go over well.
This isn't guaranteed to give sensible results if an object enters/exits the hole while in close contact with / intersecting the terrain. Usually you'll want to have some other geometry skirting around the hole, both visually and in its collision, to keep the player from seeing or interacting with the raw edge, so this should keep us out of those cases.
One approach to doing this would be to set the terrain heights in the hole region absurdly low, allowing objects to fall into the hole. But that might have unpleasant visual artifacts at the edges of your terrain (especially as it drops to lower LODs, which might cause the hole to erode its surroundings) and only allows you to make pits, not caves/tunnels that travel laterally.
