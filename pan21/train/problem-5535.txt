3) So, googled and there were no results that explains about ESP. All I could find is the EFI. I found a related result and mounted System Reserved to E:. using diskpart. Then, I followed all the instructions. Kept all the data inside of system reserved. Rebooted and nothing happened. 
I had Ubuntu 14.04 on a single drive. Then, I felt like installing Windows 10 along side with Ubuntu. I resized the main Ubuntu partition and unallocated half of the safe. Then, I installed Windows 10 in that half of the unallocated space that I got. One thing I knew before doing all of it: that boot manager will not work properly and I'll not be able to boot into Ubuntu but I am already using rEFInd on my MacBook pro(bootcamp 8.1 & yosemite) and knew that it would fix every boot issue. So, followed the instructions.
2) When I reached second step of the instruction. i.e. mountvol S: /S it return me The parameter is incorrect. I have just one drive i.e. C: in my pc. What is this S: for? I also change that to mountvol C: \C and return disk not empty result.
