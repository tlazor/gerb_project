I've monitored CPU usage on the RDS instance during these periods, and though it does spike, it doesn't go much over 50%. Previously we were on a smaller instance size and it did hit 100%, so I'd hoped just throwing more CPU capacity at the problem would solve it. I now think it's an issue with the number of open connections. However, I've only been working with SQL for 8 months or so, so I'm no expert on MySQL configuration. 
I solved the problem by creating a read replica of the database. We can now run queries as complex and as long as we like, without taking the game down! :)
We have a Facebook game that stores all persistent data in a MySQL database that is running on a large Amazon RDS instance. One of our tables is 2GB in size. If I run any queries on that table that take more than a couple of seconds, any SQL actions performed by our game will fail with the error:
Is there perhaps some configuration setting I can change to prevent these queries from overloading the server, or should I just not be running them whilst our game is up?
