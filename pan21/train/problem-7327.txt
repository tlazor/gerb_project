Take the following OU structure - I have a Global Logon Script GPO linked at Acme Widgets, an Internal Logon Script GPO linked at Internal and various department-specific logon scripts below that. Actually, I have multiple logon scripts linked at Acme Widgets and Internal for XP, Vista and 7 which are applied according to an OS version WMI filter on the GPO.
Yes it's entirely possible to have multiple logon scripts run in multiple GPO's, but maybe not quite in the way you want.
This method works quite well for us, however your needs may be different. Have multiple OU's and Sub-OU's and apply different GPO's with linked logon scripts further down the chain.
This sounds like it is more similar to what you're after. Create your GPO's, add your logon scripts to them and link them all to an appropriate OU. Modify the permissions of the GPO so that only members of a specific group have permission to read the GPO, and apply it.
Is the new OU a sub-OU of the one where the first logon script GPO is linked?  On the machine that should get the new logon script run gpresult and look to see if the new GPO has been filtered out.  You may need to set the new logon script GPO as enforced.
