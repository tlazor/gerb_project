Beta and RC installations of W7 allow a few (3?) activations on one licence. RTM and later will almost certainly be one activation per key
Windows 7 RTM has been released on MSDN for the subscribers. There are keys also available. Each MSDN key should allow about 10 activations. I've activated Windows 7 on two virtual machines with the same MSDN key.
There's always the possibility to call Microsoft support and tell them you've installed your windows 7 on a new PC, and then they can de-activate the previous one for you (I think it's like that). Then you can re-activate it on your new PC (but it won't stay activated on your previous one).
With a normal key, it should not let you activate on the second machine (sometimes it will if it thinks the hardware is similar - I have seen this - but would not recommend trying it because that would be very naughty).
It will not let you activate it on the 2nd one. And I'm not sure there's a possibility to "deactivate" an installation. 
MSDN/TechNet... they do usually come in packs.  The number depends on the level of your subscription, so yes you can reuse the key up to however many you have been assigned.
