I'm not aware of any way around that. Backblaze, Crashplan, and Carbonite don't allow backups of your systems actual OS/Programs.  So since you can't create an actual system image with this type of backup software backing up your program folders wouldn't provide any real benefits for most programs.
If you're simply wanting to create a system image so you have a backup of your actual system you should use windows built in imaging tool. Go to start, type "backup and restore" and then click on "backup and restore" then to the left you'll want to click "create a system image" this will allow you to create a actual bootable system image you can use for restoring your actual system state such as settings/programs/files etc. Backblaze cannot create a bootable system image. (Although you can use it to backup the Windows image backup.)
You can use a backup utility like Duplicati to create a backup job that backups to another local folder that Backblaze won't exclude.
Downside is that you will use twice the size of the original folders, but you can be selective on what is backed-up if you prefer.
Also backing up folders like C:\windows really doesn't do any good either for the same reason listed above. Backblaze is really just meant to backup files like, movies, pictures, documents etc. It's not intended for creating bootable system images and or sys state information.
