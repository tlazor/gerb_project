May I offer a suggestion that you try the recent 4.0 beta release of Passenger Phusion for Open Source?  It integrates with Apache and enables you to install JRuby Rack-based applications in one of your enabled sites.
Next, add the following lines to your Apache configuration file (either apache.conf or the sites-enabled config file):
The Apache integration does indeed work well for me.  Please note that this may not be an ideal enterprise setup.  First, it's a beta release.  Second, it is my understanding that the non-enterprise version of this passenger mod will not be multi-threaded.  What that means precisely with respect to a JVM application does not make sense to me, but I haven't researched enough to determined if it is actually an issue.  Also note that I am making this recommendation for those who are interested in getting something setup quickly, and specifically using an existing Apache installation.
