You can speed up the process (a little) with sync option enabled by using a large block size bs to avoid repeteadly accessing the disk between small amounts of time and thus making the overall process slower.
I've always used dd without the sync option and I've never experienced any issues, just wait for information to be completely written prior to ejecting any device.
Without sync the copying process is overall faster and the device may be done writing sooner than with sync enabled, but you may notice that when information has been completely copied, in fact the disk may be still writing information from its cache to the real support. This is often good for hard drives or when you don't plan to disconnect the device as soon as the copy has been done.
sync tells the process to wait until all data has been correctly written to disk before moving on to the next block. This is usually better to ensure data integrity and to avoid data loss in case of a power outage (such as disconnecting the drive just as it has finished writing data), but it is slower.
bs means that n b (bytes) are read and written each time. It stands for block size. bs does not necessarily affect the input block size ibs nor the output block size obs.
