We have a large amount of data on an EBS volume. I am familiar with attaching the volume to a new EC2 cluster. 
Or else what you can do is, create EFS (Elastic File System) and then mount it in all the core nodes using nfs util (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/wt1-test.html)
But how is this done for EMR ? Here is the Add Storage dialog: notice there is no entries for specifying the EBS Snapshot ID:
Step 4: Go to EC2 console and then select Volumes from the left navigation menu. Select the volume you want to mount and then from Actions dropdown select 'Attach Volume'. paste the EC2 instance id and done.  
Step 2: Go into the instance group, in our case CORE, because we wanted the data to available on the worker nodes.
if you want to share that data in all the participating core nodes then you need to have a separate volume created for each node and then attached.
This EBS volume will most likely be available as /dev/sdf in EC2 instance which you then mount on any directory by ssh'ing to that instance.
