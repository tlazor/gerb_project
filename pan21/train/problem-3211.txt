I use print screen quite a lot, so I do want to find it easily. And because there is no actual official use with F13-F19 button in Win, why do not map those to some useful funtions.
I found easiest way to key PrtScr to F13-F19 button with this little tool called SharpKeys (http://www.randyrants.com/sharpkeys/). It writes registry changes for you.
You can easily change CMD and ALT button to match regular windows keyboard layout if you wanted also. Many want to do this also if use mac keyboard on windows.
If you have Microsoft Office installed in your machine, then look for Microsoft OneNote. It has a Screen Clipping feature which can be invoked by Right Command + S. Once you press Right Command Key + S, you will see your screen go white transparent and select desired area to capture. Screen Clipper will then ask Copy to Clipboard or One-note. Choose Copy to Clipboard. Bingo! you can paste it anywhere as you want it, ur mail, document, powerpoint, etc.,
TIP: There is also great print screen program that can be useful called LightScreen (http://lightscreen.sourceforge.net/). It's free and there is also portable version available. I found this very useful, because it's let me to choose regions etc.
Can anyone out there tell me how to do a screen capture in Windows with a Mac keyboard plugged in? I have my Mac keyboard and mighty mouse plugged into a KVM switch that controls both my MacbookPro and my WinXP desktop. I'm having a terrible time trying to do certain things that require those extra keys like insert and print screen. Even the num-pad doesn't work! Any ideas, tips, tools, drivers?
To do a print screen while running Windows in Boot Camp and using a Mac keyboard, use the keyboard combination: SHIFT + FN + F11
