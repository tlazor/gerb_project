Can your own box correctly resolve the domain name you're using? If you're requesting files from www.domain.com, can you ping 'www.domain.com' from itself - Does it resolve the correct external IP that would receive when you ping 'www.domain.com' from an external connection.
On the server, I can "curl " or "wget ", and that works. I can use PHP to request pages externally hosted (google.com etc.), but I can not do it with pages hosted on my lighttpd config on the same server.
1) The machine name is aliased in your /etc/hosts as 127.0.0.1 and your webserver isn't bound to the loopback address
2) What about load-balancers, are you using any that might cause routing issues when trying to route to itself
If you change it to, say, 50, it works fine. I'm assuming that it needs to fork off another process or something to make the CURL request, and can't because max-procs is set to 1 by default. 
I have a webserver which serves content for a site, let's call it "domain.com". On that site, I have several PHP scripts that serve content. When someone browses to that site, everything works.
If I request, from within PHP (with Curl/Fopen), a URL on my own site (I'll call "domain.com/api/something.php?x=y", I get a timeout that the site could not be contacted. That only happens when I request that URL via PHP, not when called via the CLI. When I browse the URL from externally, that works.
