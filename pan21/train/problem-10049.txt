With Azure, you can deploy anything that you could a) xcopy over and b) run something from the command line to start.  Sadly this means most traditional Windows software with installers, registry entries, services, etc. don't run out of the box.
What you probably want to do is take whatever payload is being run as a service and instead wrap it in the Azure runner.  There's nothing stopping the code from running and binding to a port, it's just that you have to start it using the Azure mechanism instead of a Windows service.  
However, a more ideal way to run a service in Windows Azure is to set it up as a Service Role and NOT as a Windows Service.  Keep in mind the fact that you're dealing with the cloud and not the operating system, at least ideally.  If you're needing to deal directly with the operating system then you may want to re-think the architecture & tooling that you're using.
On the azure site they write about your application being run in a window server environment and that you should be able to run anything that you normally can on a window server.
No, it is not possible to install a traditional Windows service on Azure.  They are working on a VM kind of product you could use to do this, but it's not out yet AFAIK.
