After seeing this I unplugged my Ethernet cord and went into my network and tried to change my ipv4 which i dont really get how to do and also went into my firewall and blocked every inbound and outbound TCP and UDP ports which make it so i couldn't use the internet other than youtube after I plugged my Ethernet back in. When I blocked the ports on my firewall I checked the 'netstat' again and it only showed these
So what I am wonder is if this is actually someone hacking(most likely is) and is there a way I could fix this? I deleted my chrome cache and went onto my phone and checked the router login and checked the logs which doesn't show any sign. I also checked my "Wifi Inspector" on my phone and it doesn't show any new devices connected to my wifi so im thinking its only on my PC and not my actual router.
I was using a win7 ISO on one VM that I downloaded the Darkcomet on and Kali Linux on another VM to use the built in functions to check IPs and that stuff. I had the VMs connected to my ethernet driver which im pretty sure how they connected. After I was done attempting to use Darkcomet that wasn't working the way it should, I figured i would check my CMD on my actual PC to see if the Darkcomet I downloaded was really just a virus that someone used to connect to my PC. I'm not very good with 'hacking' per say and i dont know how to do mostly anything but i am trying to learn. When I opened CMD I typed 'netstat' to see if someone was connected and it showed this set if things
