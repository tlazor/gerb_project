If you are looking to set them up with "virtual desktops" then a terminal server + VPN would do the trick. The good side to this is that they will have secure access to a centralized server, with centralized management. The downside is that you need to train them on VPN client access [good luck!].
It best solution depends a lot on how the staff normally work and the applications they require but here are a few options.
If you are willing to keep them on their local desktops, I would highly recommend LogMeIn. They have a "free" version without file transfer, remote sound, and remote printing. Their Pro^2 version includes all of that and is only about $50-$70 a year (depending on how many licenses you have). The ease of use for the end-user and the simplicity for you to install it on their PCs will make it well worth the money.
You could also do this for free with a VPN+VNC solution, but take my word on this, putting the money into LogMeIn (or other competing remote desktop solution) is well worth it.
