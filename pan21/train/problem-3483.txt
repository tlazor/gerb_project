But my question is even more basic i guess...  I logon to the secondary server, and obviously Exchange isn't on there so i assume i'd need to install it first before i can set it as a passive/backup server.  I run the install but when i select Passive Clustered Mailbox Role it informs me it needs to be setup as a Clustered Server first (which makes sense).  But i'm wondering, do i need to set up two servers in a cluster to make this work?  I'm not wanting real-time failover, just the SCR ability to turn the passive server into the active server in response to a disaster.  Would i just need to install Exchange on the second server as if it were the only one in the domain (Mailbox Role) and then once done, run the above commands?  Any help explaining this woudl be greatly appreciated, thanks!
I'm currently wanting to implement a backup Exchange server, and from what i read it sounds like SCR is the way to go.  I currently have one Exchange 2007 server, pretty small and nothing special going on.  I built another server and set the drives the same (as was recommended on technet).  Online i see several sites saying, "all you need to do is this" run these commands:
