I'm trying to make a diskless PC client and install the operating system on a SAN Storage. As of now i'm using windows server 2012 R2 and it will serve as my DHCP/WDS and SAN server. So I found a video from yourtube on "Bjørn Jentoft" channel with the title "Hyper-V: Windows installation to ISCSI disk" I followed all the steps and configurations but it didn't quit work for me. But I keep repeating his video to look if I miss something on the configuration steps, but when I checked everything it appears that I didn't miss anything based on what he showed on the video tutorial. By the way he used HYPER-V on his tutorial and I'm using physical machines.
In this case my guess is on that Windows TFTP server has not been configured to allow that path. Normally it only accepts paths that starts with Boot, see this documentation: http://ipxe.org/appnote/chainload_wds
I’ve read about different successful iPXE implementations with StarWind iSCSI target, but haven't tested myself yet. 
Here is an article that you may find helpfull: https://jonmccune.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/diskless-windows-7-with-iscsi-and-gpxe/
My suggestion in a case like this is to check the tftp servers log, or resort to packet dumps (for example with wireshark) to see what is going on.
