My VMs all seem to have 10.0.2.15 as IPs, but maybe that's a coincidence. Check that, if it doesn't work.
The above answer (by cosmo0) should solve the problem, except if you need authenticated connection. For authentication, choose external in  VM Settings > Display > Remote Display > Authentication Method. Then in RDP client, press Show Options and tick Allow me to save credentials. Press connect and it should prompt you with loging/password dialog.
Locate VBoxManage.exe command line tool (in my case it was inC:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\) and perform following commands while VM is off:
This way your create an RDP user that should work. NOTE, this user is NOT related to any existing users in guest or host os, its for VirtualBox only.
On the guest OS, check that RDP is enabled: on Win7, right click computer > properties > Remote settings (on the left panel) > Allow connections (I used the "less secure" one)
The host's IP must be the actual host's IP if you want to connect with another computer, or 127.0.0.1 if you want to connect on the host computer.
The VMs downloaded on modern.ie have an "auto-logon" feature that's nice in general, but annoying in this scenario (they might prevent you from logging in). On Win7, run "netplwiz" and check "Users must enter a user name and password". The password of the user can be found here (it's Passw0rd!)
This should work without running a server on the VM. It is VirtualBox's server you are connecting to.
