If you are in the UK connected to a BT line, unplug the router from the phone line, remove the cover from the MASTER plate which is where the line enters the house, inside there is a TEST socket - connect to that and rerun the test. Again, if you are still getting the problem, contact your ISP.
Definitely try pinging a more local service by IP address rather than name - bbc.co.uk is a good one for the UK. Also make sure that nothing is connected to the router (unplug all of the LAN cables) when you test. If you are still getting a problem, contact your ISP.
I have an ADSL connection at home. Pings times are usually acceptable right after rebooting the modem, between 15 and 60ms to google.com. A few minutes later they go up to 900ms or even higher up to 3 to 4 seconds. There is only one phone plug in the house with the ADSL modem connected. Nothing else uses that line. I asked my ISP about this for several times and all they can come up with is the dreaded "did you turn it on and off" response.
