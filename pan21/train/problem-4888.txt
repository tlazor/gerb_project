And generally, what consequences does it have if I set a password? I noted that Scheduled Tasks apparently cannot run under an account w/o password (creating a scheduled task will prompt for the account PW). Is there anything that will not work with a password set? Why is it even possible to have accounts without a password?
When you start Windows XP for the first time, it is expected to create a password for that account. It's just a different way of doing things.
If you set a password it will not auto login, unless you specifically ask it. (something which in my opinion makes no sense).
I do not quite understand how Windows (specifically Windows XP) handles accounts with/without passwords.
Scheduled Tasks can run just fine on an account without a password. When you're prompted for the password, press Enter.
If you set a password, it will (naturally) always ask for it. However, on my installation (with integrated SP2) it always asks to click on username, regardless of whether it has a pass or not, so that depends, obviously maybe.
By default the new accounts you create don't have password, with the exception of the Administrator account.
Unless, it is your home machine, which only you have access on, I would generally suggest putting on a password. At least something simple which you can type in a quick one handed stroke (like trew or something like that).
