At my work there are at least 40 people sharing the same internet connection link over the same switch that is used both to internet access and local traffic of large file. 
Since its a switched network, high local traffic will negatively affect only those whose individial connections are being saturated. i.e. those actually doing the local transfers
With no doubt what actually travels through the..."wire" affects activity on the medium itself, moreover when it is used bidirectionally for local and www traffic...
i would recommend reproducing the problem and seeing for yourself by simulating a slow network yourself...one tool that comes to mind is TMNetSim ....
People here usually use local network to share large files up to 5GB, so the 10/100MBps ethernet network becomes overloaded most part of the day. At the same time, as some people is sharing these files, other people are using internet to do their work, but at random time of the day, internet becomes unavaiable. So, I'm wondering if the high local loads of file sharing on local network would be a reason to the unavailability of internet on specific times of the day....
