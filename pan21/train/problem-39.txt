$\phi$ is a number that is sampled uniformly in the range $(0,2\pi)$ this means that rays will be generated around the reflected direction with no bias towards any particular direction.
Generated rays will, however, be biased to have a direction close to $R$ due to the way that $\theta$ is sampled.
Rather, we use a different reference system where the Specular reflection direction is the 'z axis', thus, our angle $\theta$ is the angle between the reflected direction and the sample direction, and the angle $\phi$ is the angle between some $S_{ix}$ that is the projection of our sample direction onto the plane perpendicular to $R$ and some arbitrary but constant vector perpendicular to our reflected direction
When we generate rays in a backwards pathtracer we use the view direction to get the directions where the light is likely to come from, instead of throwing light around and seeing where it falls. The later technique is closer to photon mapping.
Consider the following scheme that mimicks the generation of a sample for phong shading. where V is the viewer direction, N is the normal, R is the specular reflection direction and $S_i$ is some sample. This space (commonly called tangent space) uses the normal as one of its basis vectors. you can think of it as the 'Z axis'
