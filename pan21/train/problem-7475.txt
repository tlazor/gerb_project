The other possibility could be a subnet mask mismatch. Every computer on the same network needs to have the same subnet mask configured (along with being in the same actual network of course.) The computer uses the subnet mask to determine not only the IP broadcast address but also to determine whether broadcast packets received should be processed by the network stack (i.e. if broadcast packets for IPs that would fall outside the address and subnet mask configured on the device, many devices will ignore the packet.) 
While I'm not super familiar with advanced configuration on OpenWRT (it's on my to-do-list for geek projects), my first piece of advice would be to ensure that you're not doing NAT on "Bob". If Alice were on the LAN side of a WAP, and Charlie was on the WAN side, then Alice would be able to ping Charlie but not vice versa. That's the inherent firewall that NAT provides.
For this not to be the case, all of your APs have to be operating in some form of "bridge" mode or "access point" mode. This means that the device acts as more or less a packet forwarder - it does not do any routing or packet inspection of its own. The easiest way to achieve this on cheaper routers is to disable the DHCP server in the router and then connect one of the LAN ports to your network (and also ensure that the router's LAN IP won't conflict with your actual gateway). You would leave the WAN port hanging. If the router complains (most don't but some do), set the Internet connection to a static IP and use something like 223.255.255.254 with a 255.255.255.252 subnet mask for the address and 223.255.255.253 for gateway. (Trivia: that's the last Class C subnet of the smallest possible size.)
