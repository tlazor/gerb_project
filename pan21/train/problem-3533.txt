If you shut down X and move those config files in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d and /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/, you should be able to start X on the HDMI display, presuming something funny wasn't done with the kernel.  At the very least, you should get a more detailed description of the problem in the .log.
The GUI stack on GNU/Linux usually requires (at least) two drivers, one used by the kernel, and a userspace one for the X server.  I think the latter one tends to be more generic, which is perhaps why there's no indication of one being installed; the kernel one handles the specifics so that a more generic, pre-installed driver can be used with X (in contrast, another question about a touchscreen here yesterday seemed to involve a generic and/or preinstalled kernel driver, but a custom X driver).
X logs various things at start up to /var/log/Xorg.0.log.  It is tidy about this and rolls them over, so that log contains only information from the most recent start (hence you will also find a .1.log and so on, these are for previous initializations).  It also indicates going through your configuration line by line.
If that works, you just need a script (or two) that will symlink and unlink those configuration files depending on which display you want to use.  Stupidly enough, xinit and startx don't seem to have options for using alternate .conf files.  However, if it does work, you might be able to create a .conf that covers both displays, since X does not have a problem running multiple different monitors.  You could then enable or disable them and change certain parameters from within the GUI using xrandr.
The X server does not require a configuration, in which case it probes the hardware and tries to makes an appropriate decision.  However, if you do provide a configuration, it will stick to that.  If that configuration is wrong, it will fail.
