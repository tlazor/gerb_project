Another command to try is "ifconfig eth0 add x.x.x.1 netmask 255.255.255.0", or with "netmask 255.255.255.252" for a /32 class network. this command will automatically assign the subinterface numbers for you, starting with eth0:0, using eth0:1 next.
If you want to use /30 class networks, you can use xxx.xxx.xxx.1 and xxx.xxx.xxx.2 on one network segment (the xxx.xxx.xxx.0 network) and xxx.xxx.xxx.5 and xxx.xxx.xxx.6 on another network segment (xxx.xxx.xxx.4 network)
In each subnet, the first address is for the network, and the last is usually for broadcast. so xxx.xxx.xxx.0 and xxx.xxx.xxx.3 wont work for a /30 class network, and all IP addresses on a /32 network are network addresses. network addresses are used for routing, and cannot be assigned to a device
Also, im not sure if the networks can be referred to as being "/30 class" or "/24 class". I'm not sure what the proper term is.
Also, it looks like your trying to assign all IP addresses to eth0:1 , try using eth0:2, eth0:3 and eth0:4
