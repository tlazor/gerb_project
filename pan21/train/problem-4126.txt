For this VM, you can run it with about 64-256MB of memory, and probably about 1-4GB virtual disk, depending on your laptop specs.
VirtualBox is easy to use for the basic stuff, but there are a lot of advanced configuration options buried in the command line tools. Spend some time reading the Vbox help file for networking, and you can simulate your home router connection, too. My choice for doing this would be to put the server vm on it's own subnet, behind another vm running as a router (Vyatta community edition is good for this), and connecting with the clients through the router. I think this is more flexible than Vbox routing, and more applicable to real common networking skills.
I suggest installing the latest version of VirtualBox on your laptop, and running a VM using the 32-bit version of Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS.
I also suggest running a second VM with the same version of Ubuntu, but configure this one with a desktop login (adjust vm specs accordingly). This way you'll have a Windows and an Ubuntu client to connect to the server vm with. Use putty on Windows for ssh access to your server.
