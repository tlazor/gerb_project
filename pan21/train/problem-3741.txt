Now, from I have read online, am I correct in thinking that this requires a modification to the pg_hba.conf file. But! I cannot find this file. My database cluster is stored in /var/lib/postgresql/9.0, but there is no pg_hba file there! Someone might have moved it away from the default directory, and stored it who knows where. 
You will also want to make sure to grab the old postgresql.conf and put it under /var/lib/postgresql/9.0 as well.
The pg_hba.conf file should be located under the data directory; on a default install (at least on SuSE) this would be /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf.  On yours I think it will be /var/lib/postgresql/9.0/pg_hba.conf
So, my question is that, can I fix the user not authenticated problem by editing the pg_hba file (I had thought that when you did a pg_dump and restored the DB, authenticated users would come with it, but maybe that's wrong), and if I do need to access the pg_hba file, how can I find it?
So, as I alluded to in a past question, I moved the database to a new server, but the DB can't be accessed by the old code.
Yes, you need the pg_hba.conf file from the old database server.  Dumping and restoring the database will not copy this file; all it does it dump and restore the table structures and the data they hold.
