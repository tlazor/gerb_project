I can't tell if there's enough space on all the sides for the opposite male USB's "metal box" to get around the plastic tongue. I'd try taking something firm, like a small piece of cut business card or thin plastic card (ice cream pail lid?), and see if it will fit all around the connector - if it gets stuck you've narrowed down the problem, I'm still guessing a bent tab, or foreign object.
Assuming the male USB is good, I don't see what else the problem could be. Just needs space for the "metal box" to go around the "plastic tongue" and the connectors to be flat enough or squish up.
It doesn't look bad in your photos, the 4 yellow contact areas don't look like they're sticking down too far, and the top tabs don't look bent, the plastic "tongue" looks ok, it looks a lot like a stock photo of a USB connector:
The Tongue in the bottom third of the slot could be broken, allowing the drive to be partially inserted the wrong way.
The problem sounds like the top tabs would be bent, or a contact is bent or sticking up too far. Some (all?) of the connectors use springy contacts, you could check that all 4 of them move almost flush when they're pressed (upwards).
