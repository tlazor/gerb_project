Even if I moved it to the same box without hyperthreading it would get 2 full cores instead of 2 vCPU.
However, I cannot see the real issue from what you have described unless you can provide your actual "CPU Ready" value.  
The business system VM is configured with 2 vCPU's and 24 GB of RAM. The OS is Windows Server 2008 R2. 
One is really doing very little right now and will likely be turned off in the very near future. It has 2 vCPU and 8 GB of RAM.
You are correct in your assumptions. For your particular case stacking Mhz's instead of vCores is a right way to go. Take a look at this processor: (features 4x 3,5-3,7 Ghz physical cores + HT).
We had a DBA look at it and he does not feel that it is the cause of our issues, at least not from the database performance side.
We purchased the 2 core license and are currently running it on VMWare. It is quite expensive to move to the next license level.
The 3rd VM is running our public website. It averages less than 25 percent on CPU. It has 3 vCPU and 16 GB of RAM.
Does it make sense to build a server specifically to gain the best Single Thread performance for an application like this?
Since I am limited to two cores I would select the fastest "Single Thread Performance" cpu I could get, likely 4 cores.
