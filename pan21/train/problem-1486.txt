My concern is I don't know how sensitive this would be to "something changing"  Could we put the disks back in any readynas pro shell, or would it have to be the one we originally took them out of?  If we updated the firmware, would this prevent us from accessing the data again?  
We have a netgear readynas pro with 6 drives.  It's configured using netgear's X-RAID2 format, which is (I think) similar to RAID 5.  The NAS is almost completely full, and needs to be cleaned up and archived, so we are asking our lab members to copy all their data off the drive and archive what they aren't actively using.
Instead of copying the data from the NAS onto drives (using e.g. rsync), I am wondering if I can just label the drives and put them in a box, then install new drives in the NAS.  This would also allow us to expand the capacity, and I would hope that if we needed to access the old data, we could just put the old drives back in a readynas shell. 
We're then going to back up the NAS and wipe it, and let people put the data they are still actively using back on.
