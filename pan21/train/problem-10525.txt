or if you want to allow for any character (eg punctuation) you can exclude fourth character being digit with a variation:
The < means beginning of word ie we want the 3 digits to be at start of word but don't want to pick up 3 digits part-way through a longer sequence (eg ignore 12345 by not finding 345 within it).  
In both examples, in the Find what section, the round brackets indicate parts - we want to find  the 3 digits at start of a "word" as the first part, and to find only those where the  next character is a letter ie the second part that we want to keep.  
In the replace with \2 means we "replace" our found text (eg 123A) with just the "A" part (rest of text following that unchanged as not part of the "find" result).
You could do this in Word (ie not scripting) with a wildcard find and replace.  If 3 digits will always followed by letter:
The square brackets are a range of characters so [0-9] means any digit from 0 to 9, and {3} means a sequence of 3 of those characters.  The [A-Za-z] means any letter lower case or upper case.  The alternative option with [!0-9] finds everything except (! is not) digits 0 to 9.
