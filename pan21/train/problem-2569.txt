Press CMD + S in the Chrome browser window where the URL is displaying and it should automatically download the URL :) 
While Safari allows you to Option-Return to download any URL this way, Chrome does not support that, so http://example.org/file.zip will download, http://example.org/file.htm won't.
Open Automator, create a Service that receives URLs as input in any application. Add the Download URLs action (don't worry about the Safari icon, the application isn't used at all or even started when executing). Save as "Download URL" or similar. You can now access the service from Application menu » Services » Download URL
Go to System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services, locate your new service, and assign a keyboard shortcut.
To use your service, select a URL and press the assigned keyboard shortcut. The file will appear in the folder specified in Automator.
I know this is a late answer, but I'm putting it here for anybody who may still stumble upon this post as I just have.  If the previous answers do not suit your needs, you can do as follows:
You can optionally append the Reveal Finder Items Automator action. This would open your downloads folder after the file is saved, and select the downloaded file.
