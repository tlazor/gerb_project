Depending on the precise model of UPS, your best bet is to wire the EPO port on the back of those UPSes to the EPO switch on the fire panel. 
Half-assing it with suicide software monitors on servers connected to each UPS is the kind of close-enough that gets fire-inspectors to shake their head in that special way that means you'll have to do it all over again, but right this time.
The only choices I would be comfortable with are: something inside the UPS itself triggers a shutdown when it detects overheating (e.g. ambient temperature significantly above normal); or hard wiring to the EPO port (sometimes called REPO port) with some sort of thermal relay or similar. You want this to work, without the slightest shadow of doubt, under all situations.
Since these UPSes actually have an actual Emergency Power Off function built in, in order to make your fire-inspectors happy you need to wire those ports to the EPO function of the fire-panel itself. I'm not an electrician, so I don't know the specifics of how you'd wire 10's of these to a single EPO port on the fire panel, but that's a question for your fire panel system vendor.
I've worked with the APC powerchute software and APC management cards quite a bit but I'm struggling to see how you can achieve this with your current APC's. You've got two scenarios to contend with:
My question is: How will the UPS differentiate between the two events? How will the UPS detect the second event? You definitely need something more upscale than your typical UPS that can tie in to and monitor the fire supression system. A Smart-UPS 2200 just doesn't have this capability (that I'm aware of).
I for one would never sleep soundly knowing that a Nagios / SNMP solution was doing the job of fire supression.
