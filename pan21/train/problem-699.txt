Also with using logmein I can remotely work on anyone's computer as long as its connected to the internet, even if the its not connected to the servers correctly or if the user is at home.
Part two of this is I have Logmein installed on all the computers on the remote sites.  (there are desktops there)  So when the router's IP address changes at the remote site, the internet still works.  This means Logmein can still connect and I can still login to a deskop at the remote site, remotely.  I then from this desktop login to the router since the internal IP is still the same, and reset the VPN.  This happens maybe 2x year to me.
I use the Linksys RV042 routers.  I can't remember the last time I had to power cycle them (6 months plus atleast).  I have 3 sites that connect back to a primary site all using RV042's.
The only time the VPN between the routers goes down is when one of the remote site's IP addresses changes.  This is because the ISP for those sites does not offer static IP's for a decent price.
