You can't create dd backups of a running system, as you most likely won't end up with a consistent image of your file system. To image something with dd it must not be mounted or mounted read-only. 
The system has 2 SSD drives with 500GB and a remote FTP server ready for backup. I created the following backups, but I am not sure if this was correctly done and would allow me to recover like intended. As it is a software raid, I assume it is enough to backup MBR and one SSD 
Question: Is this backup procedure OK and sufficient to recover to the same server and what would be the savest way to rebuild from the backup files?
I just finished configuring a dedicated remote ubuntu server and want to create a backup with DD in order to be able to rebuild fast in case of hardware issues.
If you dd from a rescue system instead of a live system, you could as well backup the whole of sda (or sdb) at once. Currently, you appear to be missing /dev/sda1, which quite likely is raided to be mounted as /boot, containing your kernel (which is essential, naturally).  Also, if you have  a MBR partition table, the partition table will be  already included in the MBR (this is not true for GPT, of course).
