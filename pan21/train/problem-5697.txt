As far as indexes, what you need for your system is dependent on your system. Whatever gives you good performance for reads and decent enough performance for writes might be what you need for your system. But what happens if the business has decided that reads are far more important than writes? Maybe for that system you need tons of indexes in order to satisfy the performance requirements of the business and the users. The more indexes you have on a table, the slower writes are going to be. 
Assume a database size of 200 GB with a slow growth rate.  My preference is to have 50% available space.  I have my alerts set up to warn me at 25% space left, then at 15% and then Page at 5% as critical.
A lot of this is subjective until you put a case to the question.  Just percentages don't tell the whole story.
Each company has a different comfort level on allowable space.  This usually measured by growth of the data, importance of the application, size of the database and available money to buy storage space.  
Your setup may be different.  If you have a highly transactional database that is large in size and eats up data storage like candy, then it will be a combination of maintenance and storage growth.  In a terabyte size database it is difficult to justify 500GB just sitting unused unless the growth rates or transaction bursts warrant it.
The only one that we can answer is for "unallocated". You want there to be free space inside the file so that it doesn't have to autogrow (if enabled).
