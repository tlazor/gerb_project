When typing in a table, often times we're entering text in all caps. Word seems to ignore those words for some reason (perhaps it thinks it's a title and titles don't matter?). If you replace one upper case character with the equivalent lower case letter then spell check will pick it up right off the bat.
CRTL+A - in review pane, go at Language/select proofing language/ click detect language automatically. Hope it helps
Try selecting your entire table, then click the Language button in the statusbar and make sure that "Do not check spelling and grammar" is not checked.
I had the same issue on a document wherein spell check seemed to work on a line by line basis inside various tables. In other words, misspelled words were caught on some lines and not on others. The language and proofing settings were all correct. What I found in the end was that the text in the table had different styles assigned in the background within the same table, even though all the text looked the same. I think this happens when people cut and paste into a table and the original style gets lost in translation. The ultimate fix is to select the entire table, then clear all formatting, then select "table text" as the style. Once the styles are resolved, the spell checker will work again.
