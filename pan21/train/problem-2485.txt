well if you can buy a video capture device that is compatible via vga-dvi then yes. you may need another computer to plug the device in that's why i use a camera instead but it is possible.
Nowadays, you can't easily inject (via PCI) optional ROMs unless normal x86 bios exits all its initializations and configs. It was truly possible on some older mobos, where integrated video rom was loaded prior to main bios code, and is possible with some disk controller roms as said in the article above. Then, you can grab a copy of frame buffer from the rom and dump it to some place..
I assume this is for a home PC, but if it were for a server, many come with Remote Management Cards, like Dell's DRAC. You could remote into the DRAC card during your native Windows session, and record the DRAC card boot up with any number of screen capturing video programs.
But can recommend you buying an old HP RILOE unit (seen those on ebay for $10 - you plug it into PCI slot, it works as a LAN-available videocard console including BIOS access) or, if you can afford newer hardware - any IP-kvm would allow you to get the screens.
You can write and inject (from disk) some kind of pre-loader which will capture Windows boot at the framebuffer.
