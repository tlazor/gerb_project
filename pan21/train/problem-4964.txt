The video assets are all stored centrally and managed by a central asset manager server. The clients access them over the network and at the moment, that works great.
I'm currently looking to design a storage architecture for a video production team. I've got the disk part sorted, but I'm looking for some advice on the tape library / long term archive part.
There's a product called XenData that appears to do exactly this (http://www.xendata.com/products09/X64.html) but it appears to be Windows only, and I can't find any resellers online. Are there any other software solutions that can do a similar thing?
What I'd like is for a tape library to be presented to the system as a network share, so that an auto-archive job can just copy the assets from disk storage to the network share. The tape software would then manage the process of putting that data on tape, and doing some caching on local disk. Any client connecting to the network drive would see the full catalog of files and directories stored on tape and could initiate a pull from tape (or cache) just by requesting the file over the network. Obviously, this would be quite high latency, but has the advantage of not requiring the client to have any special software or knowledge about how tape libraries work.
