Wow, so it turns out that (and I still don't know why) you have to play a test sound at 100% volume before you can use any tool which would otherwise control that volume (such as alsamixer or amixer).
All of the tutorials I can find from 2 hours of searching seem to assume that if you can see a device in aplay you should be able to see it in amixer.
I'm using the speaker bonnet / following instructions from adafruit: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-speaker-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-usage.
What could be wrong? Is it because I'm using Raspbian stretch? Adafruit seems to imply they don't support it: https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=122904
I followed all of the steps (skipping the sound tests because on a previous install I hurt my ears!) and after both reboots alsamixer still doesn't have volume controls.
That's the only answer I have right now. I really hope I'm wrong (i.e. there is some way to turn down the volume before playing sound) but this is what fixed my problem.
I've seen other threads where people say it started "mysteriously" working and it's possible that they for some reason actually got a sound through the device.
But amixer is totally unresponsive (amixer -h gives the commands but amixer and amixer scontrols and amixer -c 0 and so on all give no output whatsover!
