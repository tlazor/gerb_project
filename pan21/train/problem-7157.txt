If you are looking for a tool that will somehow show you the complete zone - I think you're out of luck.
I just checked, that domain doesn't have an A record, so your dig output is correct. The website is located under www..socialimpactportfolio.com, i.e. www.socialimpactportfolio.com, which again points (two chained CNAMEs) to amazonaws.com.
Getting NOERROR and yet no ANSWER SECTION is telling you that the domain name does exist, but has no records of the specified type. In fact a domain name can exist without having any records at all, and that is different from returning NXDOMAIN, though in many cases applications will treat them the same.
As you can see, there is no ANSWER section, despite the fact that there's a working website on that domain. 
Your query is incorrect, or to put it differently - no, there is no entry for socialimpactportfolio.com. Dig is telling you about the problem.
The domain works in the browser, because it will helpfully try and add the www. prefix, and lo and behold:
In both cases a SOA record is included such that the client will know how long that answer may be cached.
Every time I use dig I get a vague feeling that I'm not really sure whether it's giving me correct data.
