If you still want to deal with this technically then if you collect the traffic numbers you can block the top 10 sites that aren't deemed important to your business and see if things improve.
If, on the other hand, the problem is that employees are spending too much of their work time the problem isn't a tech problem and should probably be dealt with other ways.
If it is the first, then it would be best to get traffic numbers.  I'd be for the idea of public traffic numbers, but, regardless, of whether or not they are public then if the problem is too much network traffic collecting the numbers would let you make intelligent decisions.
Do you mean that your employees are using too much bandwidth on these social networking sites?  Or do you mean that your employees are spending too much of their work time on certain web sites?
If you have too much traffic then, I'd collect the number for a week or two, and then announce that site zzz.com, aaa.com, etc will be blocked as of a particular date.
