I need to calculate the VC dimension for the above linear separator. Somehow, the VC dimension for this linear separator is 3. I just cannot understand how.
The VC dimension for the classifier depends on the dimension of space that your data points belong to.
According to what I understand, VC dimension is the size of the largest finite subset of X which can be shattered by h. So if there exists a subset of size n where all points are shattered by h and there exists a subset of size n+1 where at least one point is not shattered by h, then the VC dimension will be n.
In your problem, if your mean $x\in \mathbb{R^2}$, then the VC dimension is 3. For $\mathbb{R^2}$, you can always shatter any three general position points ("general position" means they do not coincidentally lie on the same line). For instance, consider three points (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). No matter how you assign labels to them, you can always seperate them by a line. If you consider point points with label (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) with label [+,-,-,+], this is the "xor" case which cannot be seperated by a line.
But I was going through a video, that explains VC dimensions which says it is three and I do not understand how.
