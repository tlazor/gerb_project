But i get an error "error CS1061: Type UnityEngine.Canvas' does not contain a definition foranchoredPosition' and no extension method anchoredPosition' of typeUnityEngine.Canvas' could be found. Are you missing an assembly reference?"
If you want the canvas to appear in front of a camera, you need to change the Canvas component to "Render Mode: Screen Space (Camera)" or "World Space" and then drag your camera into the canvas component.
The problem here is a very basic one: Canvas objects aren't Transforms. Transform objects are the only ones that contain position information, so you can't modify the position of the canvas by calling textcanvas.anchoredPosition because it doesn't exist there, you need to access the canvas's Transform: textcanvas.transform.anchoredPosition
If you want your menu to appear "transformed" I find the easiest thing to do is make an empty object under your canvas (I called it MenuTransform), and then place all your UI elements as children of that (like the panel in this example).  Then, you can transform all the elements at once.  
So we have to cast from one to the other, as the GameObject.Transform property is of type Transform, not RectTransform and anchoredPosition is a property of RectTransform and not Transform.  Hence the final solution:
