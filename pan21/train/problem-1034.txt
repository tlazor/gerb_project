Change the global shortcut for "Preferences" to "⌘ + p" (the "-g" option means "Global", and "@\" translates to "⌘"):
Limit it to the relevant app, enter Hide <yourappname> (e.g. Hide kitty in my case), and pick an obscure key combination. I use the section symbol because it's not in my default layout so I won't type it by mistake.
If you use the Karabiner app (extremely useful in its own right -- for example, you can add VIM-style navigation with Ctrl+h/j/k/l, or map the Escape key to Caps Lock), there is a "Complex Modification" that disables command-h window hiding. Install the app and see the listing: Prevent unintended command-h hide window on this page.
Do not paste this into your Terminal window if you don't feel comfortable with altering the default settings of macOS apps, or if you don't fully understand what it means. 
Now when you click on the Application's menu, you should see your new shortcut has been set, and ⌘-h will no longer hide that application.
In this example, I change the "Open Viewer" menu option in Apple Photos to "Space", like it used to be pre-2017:
The (very non-ideal, but functional) way that I solved this problem is to use Alfred to define a global hotkey mapping CommandH to nothing. You could use any app capable of defining global hotkeys to do this (ex. BetterTouchTool or KeyboardMaestro).
