You should Create a normal, non-root user for yourself, and log in as that user.  The procedures for this vary from distribution to distribution.  This user should also be able to run the command in question (since they're not root), which solves the problem in your question.
Logging in as root is a BAD IDEA - One day you will make a typo that is fairly innocuous as a normal user, but can be catastrophic as root.
Alternatively you can simply use the su command to switch to root when needed.  This lacks the flexibility of sudo, but requires no configuration on Linux systems - see the man page for su for more details.
Second, and semi-related: As others have suggested consider sudo for running the stuff you need to run as root (pretty much every linux distribution has it installed by default, or you can grab it from your package manager).  This will require a bit of configuration (you will need to add the user to the sudoers file, or on some Linux distributions simply adding them to the admin group will suffice.
