Lastly, Microsoft do have various licensing schemes that do allow a single serial key for multiple uses - however, these are not really designed for home users and can get very complicated!
The other options to you are a fully packaged product - install on as many machines as you like - but only allowed to be on one machine at any one time. Or you can use OEM, but if you plan on getting a new pc (you are allowed to upgrade an existing one), the licence will die with that machine.
But, for any standard licence other than family pack, it is not legal and you will be breaking the EULA.
You might be confusing the situation with licensed software like perhaps Word and Visual Studio that might allow you to install and run on more than one machine as long as you only run one copy at a time.
You can 'technically' use the same license on many physical machines as long as only one and only one of those machines is in phyisical use. For your example you can 'technically' have windows installed on your desktop and laptop machine and as long as one of them is turned off and not in physical use you're good to go. 
As you have found out from other answers, activation will probably prevent you from doing this. Activation is set to gather details about your hardware (CPU, disk drive, motherboard, etc) and create a custom key that will only allow that machine to run a valid version of windows. Moving the installation to another physical machine will cause the hardware detection to fire off again and invalidate the installation.
