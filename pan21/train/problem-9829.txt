If all else fails, you can disable SNMP monitoring in the printer's TCP port properties. You won't be notified when the printer becomes ACTUALLY offline, but you won't get false positives anymore.
In my case printer was seen by windows 7 as offline when someone was trying to print using wireless lan. In wire lan everything was ok and also it worked on Linux even withs wireless lan connection.
I found out that widows 7 use snmp to determine printer state, after unblocking snmp communication (of course only for printer) on our firewall it works perfectly whether client is in wire or wireless network and on with every OS.
Had the exact same issue in server W2K8 also. Local network, no routers, no filters, no firewalls, no natting. All on the same broadcast segment. Since last friday (5/24) all network printers stopped printing from the printer queue in the server. Restart print spool service had no effect. Unchecking the snmp option in the server's port settings did the job.
We've seen somewhat similar issues here, but outside of a few high-end plotters that we print directly to IP for, we're hosting the rest of them off of a printserver, and your symptoms are not exactly the same as what we've seen, but close enough. I've got a few ideas for you, in the hopes that they'll help but nothing really conclusive :)
