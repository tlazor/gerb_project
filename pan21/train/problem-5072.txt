What I'm trying to say is: As quickly as possible (depending on performance and the type of transaction) the transactions that can be found in the Transaction Log are Committed to the Main Data files (mdf, ndf) which are stored in the .bak file when Backed up. 
Your point 1 is not (in my opinion) worth doing - once switched to SIMPLE, you should backup the Database files - which will contain all data.
Notes: If you're worried, then do a Backup before 1 as well. I'll leave 3 and 4 as they are, because they're a whole different question! (http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/why-you-should-not-shrink-your-data-files/)
Once you switch to Simple the Trans Log will no longer maintain a log of operations since your last (database files) backup - at the point of the switch all transactions will have been committed to the main database files so will not be discarded - they are already effective in the database files.
The only purpose of the differing recovery models is backup strategy and time saved by not taking a bak every time.
Remember that the FULL recovery model only exists so that you don't have to backup the database files every time (so in FULL recovery model your recovery process is: Restore Main Database files, then Restore Transaction Log Backups). With the SIMPLE model the recovery process is only Restore Main Database files.
FULL model allows you to restore to the point in time when you last took a .trn (transaction log backup) - in the case of multiple trn backups that would be a restore of Bak + trn + trn + trn (if you had taken 3 trn backups since your last bak).
Although not perfect English, I think this gives a relatively good breakdown of the different models and why you'd use them: http://www.todo-backup.com/backup-resource/sql-backup-software/three-sql-server-recovery-models.htm
