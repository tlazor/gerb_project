You have several duplicate dates for some days, so you could build a pivot chart with dates in the row and the amount in the values, then build a column chart.
If you want a waterfall chart with Excel 2016, then you could add a total row at the end where you sum all values above. Then insert a waterfall chart and mark the last data point as a total.
So, create a helper table. Start with the first date and get the starting balance for 5th March. Then enter the desired dates down the column. You can now use a formula to calculate the total balance for each day. Start in F3 with this formula and copy down.
But it seems that you don't really want to plot the differences, but you first want to calculate what the final value for that day should be. These calculations will not happen automatically in a chart. You will need to have the result of these calculations in the worksheet, then use these for the chart.
When the data for the X axis is numeric (dates are numbers) then Excel will plot the data as a data series. To avoid that, remove the word "Date" from the column heading, so the cell above the dates is empty. Then Excel will put the dates as a timeline on the X axis of a column chart.
