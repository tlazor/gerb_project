I've always found Sirlin's articles very enlightening on the kind of work you have to do. He used to work at Capcom as a game designer. Here are a few you can check and are pretty good:
I think this is what makes interesting the job of a Game designer. You can imagine balancing the game is a big part of what a game designer does once the coding has started.
In other words, it's up to you how the actual algorithm works entirely. Some people will base it on damage per second, meaning the designer only has to alter how much damage, that the unit will 'do' per second. And the algorithm will say maybe, "once every second, do  amount of damage" and it will recieve  from the DPS that the designer put into the files via la editor.
A better question might be "once I find out what feels fun, how do I create the math and code to match so that all of my game is fun?"
This is called "experience."  Blizzard has made games before and learned from experience.  The heuristic to rating and improving that knowledge is "Is it fun?"
There are a few things to point out, balance isn't done exclusively by the programmer, and in most cases shouldn't actually rely (entirely) on the programmer, but the designer instead. Which leads me to the important notice, that it doesn't usually depend on the algorithm itself (unless it needs a big change) but the variables OF the algorithm. For example, the Starcraft II team had something in the editor that could exclusively edit balance through the various inputs and testing the actual design inputs by hand (through play testing combine with common sense and decidind (as previously posted) what is "fun")
In Blizzard's case they are known for iterating when trying to find fun and balance, a lot, and that shows that there is no secret math but just a lot of work.
