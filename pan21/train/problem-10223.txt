Once I've got about 100 bookmarks, I notice that my browser starts feeling very clunky. So, I go to my bookmarks, save them in HTML form to a folder on my computer then delete almost all of them from the browser, leaving just the main ones I visit, about 10-15 bookmarks.
Actually the answer is YES. The bookmarks continually ping at their respective addresses in the background, which is unknown to most people.
I can only tell you my own experience, without any nerdy jargon. I have found that YES, having too many bookmarks does slow down your browsing experience quite noticeably. I use Firefox and Chrome, and I clean my registry at least one a week with Glary Utilities. 
I am also a bit of a bookmarks hoarder. Often, if a page is interesting to me, I save it as a bookmark, probably adding dozens per week, sometimes just because I'm lazy and want to come back to that page.
I have Googled this question at various points over the years, and I must say I am annoyed at how many "experts" don't even address the question but instead use it as an opportunity to show off what they think they know.
If the browser was to continually (or periodically) poll all the bookmarked sites (or even just those on a toolbar) then it could slow your current browsing experience down as it would be downloading data in the background.
