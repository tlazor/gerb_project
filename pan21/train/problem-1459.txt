Given a graph G = (V, E), we are looking for a particular coloring $C \subseteq E$ such that no two edges in $C$ share a vertex and -- and this is the part I'm confused about -- if nodes $u$ and $v$ belong to edges in $C$ then the edge (u, v) isn't in $E$.
I gave a quick look, it looks like you didn't copy the definition right, the second requirement state that if $u$ e $v$ belong to $D$, not $C$, then $(u,v) \notin E$, where $D = \bigcup_{e \in C}âˆ‚e$. What I guess they mean is that if, say, $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ belong to $C$ and $(u,a)$, $(c,v)$ belong to $E$ then $(u,v) \notin E$ otherwise it could be added to $C$ and it would still be a valid matching.
The standard definition of the minimum maximal matching problem is exactly what it sounds like: we are looking for a matching (a set $C$ of edges, no two of which share an endpoint) which is maximal (if $e \not \in C$, then $C \cup \{e\}$ is not a matching) with the smallest possible size (i.e. we wish to minimize $|C|$, over all maximal matchings $C$.)
But that clearly can't make sense because somehow that means that if $(u, v) \in C$ then $(u, v) \not\in E$ but $C \subseteq E$.
I'm not sure how to interpret the definition in the paper to which you linked. If you replace the second requirement with your proposed criterion, you end up with a definition of a maximal matching.
