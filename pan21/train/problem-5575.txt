We have a handful of Dell machines at my work, and this is how I make sure I have the right drivers. 
I personally use these 2 softwares. Out of the 2 'Driver Booster' is a free one and you can download any number of driver updates with it in one day. 'DriverMax' is also free, but you can only download 2 updates with it on 1 day. If you want to download more, upgrade to its Pro version.
I suggest you to use 2 softwares - 'Driver Booster' and 'DriverMax'. Just download these 2 and install them and scan your computer. They will search for outdated drivers and shows you updates. You can download any update and install them successfully.
The Dell/Alienware website can auto-detect what drivers you need to download, and if you haven't upgraded the machine, they already know what the hardware is inside of it based on your service tag. It's free, but it doesn't run automatically.
Go to http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/ca/en/04/Product/alienware-m14x-r2 for your machine (this is specific to your machine), enter your service tag, then click on the "Analyze System for Updates" button on the upper-left, next to the picture of the computer. It will the walk you through getting the correct drivers and installing them.
Choose Update Driver Software after that  Choose Search automatically for updated driver software . If available then latest driver for your device will be installed automatically free of cost by Microsoft.
Try using device doctor so when you click on a driver that needs an update it will automatically forward you to their website to download it. The only downside is that you are limited to only two driver downloads per day.
