If you use centralized logon with script mounted home directories your students data will all be in one place all the time.  Also it's what most higher ed organizations are doing for student data so it gives them good practice for what to expect when they get beyond your doors. 
It's an LDAP backend and similar to Active Directory in some ways. Since you're a Mac house, it is probably your best bet, although you /can/ authenticate Macs against Active Directory (and other LDAP based models) if you really want to. 
I am a big fan of network accounts and network storage for all users. I work in higher-ed and we can trust that people can remember their passwords.  Which may be a bigger issue with younger users but probably not.   Network storage is limited by your network speed but for the sizes of files and the types of documents most students are working on that's not a huge limiting factor.  If it is you should be looking at what's wrong with your network and working on fixing the infrastructure problem there.
