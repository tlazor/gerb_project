Of course, this scaling down process, using Scott's nice metaphor, gives an obvious reason for resisting the "gravitational pull" of SAT. While there are papers published about LOGCLIQUE and similar problems, they did not draw too much attention, as these problems are less exciting than the the generic  $\mathsf{NPI}$ candidates, where there is no clear understanding of how the gravitational pull is resisted, without falling into $\mathsf{P}$.
Arguably, if the original problem was natural, the scaling down does not change this, since we only alter the size of what is sought for. The resulting problem will be an $\mathsf{NPI}$ candidate, since it is solvable in quasi-polynomial time, but still unlikely to fall into $\mathsf{P}$, as the mere size restriction probably does not introduce new structure.
Many natural problems can be expressed as Constraint Satisfaction Problems, and there are dichotomy theorems for CSPs.
This way, we can construct a natural $\mathsf{NPI}$ candidate for  every  natural $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problem. Additionally, there are also generic candidates that do not arise via scaling down, such as Graph Isomorphism, Factoring etc. Thus, one can indeed make the case that "natural-$\mathsf{NPI}$" is actually more populous than "natural $\mathsf{NPC}$."
Consider the LOGCLIQUE problem, which aims at deciding whether an $n$-vertex input graph has a clique of size $\geq \log n$. This is a natural $\mathsf{NPI}$ candidate. Now, the same type of "scaling down" can be carried out on  any  $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problem. Simply replace the question "does the input string $x$ have a property $Q$?" by the  scaled down question "does $x$ have a logarithmically  sized substring that has property $Q$?" (We may restrict ourselves only to those substrings that represent the appropriate type of structure, such as subgraphs etc.) 
Several answers pointed out that the premise of my question (the relative scarcity of natural $\mathsf{NPI}$-candidates) might be questionable. After some thinking, I must accept that they indeed have a point. In fact, one can even go as far as to make the case that there are actually  more  natural $\mathsf{NPI}$ candidates than natural $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems.  The argument could go as follows.
