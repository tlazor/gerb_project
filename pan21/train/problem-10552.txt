I tried runnung Ubuntu, liveCD and installed (yeah, wiped Win) and it happened to be less intensive, allowing a full boot, discarding physical damage.
Had that problem and it was related to processor temp rising too high, so it shuts down itself to avoid physical damage.
Do you still have your Windows OS on the drive?   If so, have you tried to revert back to a known, good day say: 2-3 weeks ago?  What about Safe Mode?  I know Safe Mode in Windows 8 is a little funky to get into.  Even though you say that Ubuntu does the same thing may suggest you still have a virii on the drive.
The CMOS is the only thing I do not see mentioned in other answers/comments. If replacing the CMOS does not work, I would say the problem is related to the MB. There could be a short circut or some sort of problem that is causing it to not deliver power efficiently. In that case, getting a MB replacement should fix your issue. 
Take it to technical service to get it clean inside. Might have dirt between processor and fan, keeping it from cooling properly.
This is a crazy problem for sure. I don't believe that 60C is hot enough to make the computer forcefully shutdown to prevent damage, so in my point of view, I don't believe overheating is the issue.
