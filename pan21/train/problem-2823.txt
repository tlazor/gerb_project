It is important to remember that although SSL can protect the flow of information between your server and a web browser, using SSL does not offer any additional system level security.
I learned in the internet that after you got the certificate and do some configures to the server, you can just add https:// and this page would be secured.
After setting up the certificate, you will see the HTTPS, check the certificate is correct and valid and you should be good to go.
SSL does provide increase level of security. But remember the word security is so vast these days that it can fall under a lot of things.
Hey I'm programming a lot with PHP and I'm building a manager system for my site, it is very important that the manager system would be secured as possible, so I want to add SSL.
Is that true?  I know I need to redirect and it's not mysite.com it's onlt www.mysite.com and all that, but that's all?
You can also improve security by carefully configuring the IIS or Apache with various modules. Ensure latest updates applied and follow best practices.
It will not protect you from various other things including bad programming and lack of data verifications. You should see best practices for PHP security such as http://phpsec.org/projects/guide/ or http://php.robm.me.uk/
Enforcing SSL is another game. Some applications have toggles to enforce SSL (as in https URL's). If yours can't do that then you'll need to do some re-writing at the web server to make sure that every request goes over a secure channel.
Yes, you got the basics right. You either need to generate a self-signed certificate, or buy one. When that is done you need to configure your web server (not PHP) to offer SSL encryption.
