B.  Once a day files and folders are copied into the DMZ. These files are never copied back to the internal network.
Is this a good approach? Please note that files in question are not critical and can live inside the DMZ.
You probably don't even have to limit the file transfers to once a day, so long as the DMZ is not allowed to initiate sessions into the internal network, there's no appreciable security threat from allowing continuous/real-time file "synchronization" from internal to DMZ.  Your only real restriction would be not using a true synchronization or replication technology which requires communication from both sides (so something like DFS-R would probably not be a good choice). Even something as simple as a robocopy /MIR job running on the internal server sounds like it would work for your purposes.
In the broad strokes, yes, what you want to do is "push" the files from the internal network to the DMZ (a session initiated from a computer on the internal network), rather than "pull" the files to the DMZ from the internal network (a session initiated from a computer on the DMZ network).  This is the way the default rules on a lot of [hardware] firewalls are configured - traffic is permitted from more secure networks to less secure networks, but not the other way around, in general:
I need to set in place a new ASP.NET MVC solution where authenticated users can download files (originally located on the internal network). For security reasons, accessing internal network from the DMZ is not recommended so I think of a way to 'copy' these files from the internal network to the DMZ once a day as described by the diagram below.
C.  Authorized users connect through internet to an ASP.NET MVC application. This application display lists of filenames filtered by folder names. Users can click filenames to download it.
