I of course can revert to setting up a Thunderbird's movemail account with /var/spool/mail (after reconfiguring exim, which does local mail delivery, appropriately), but I honestly wish to not need to.
As additional information for those wondering this same thing (which I had explored over this past summer for Thunderbird 60.8.0) I thought I would share the following, as I was hoping to couple my Thunderbird's maildir setup with mutt.
It's been some (relatively short) time since Thunderbird finally obtained maildir storage support (I'm using Thunderbird 38.1.0 at the time of this writing). Unfortunately it appears it only applies to how Thunderbird itself stores mail internally, e.g. for IMAP/POP3 accounts. What I wish though, is to be able to read the contents of a typical /home/user/.maildir directory that contains mail locally delivered for a user (as an alternative to /var/spool/mail style delivery).
Now, the best idea I've come up with is symlinking a specially-created-for-the-purpose Inbox folder from Thunderbird's 'Local Folders' account to it, but Thunderbird seems to be unable to even notice the mail in it, Inbox appears empty (not even a restart helps).
