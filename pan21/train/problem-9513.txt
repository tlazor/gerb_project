If the tickbox for Enable NFS version 3 support is not ticked, tick it and then click apply and OK. Restart the Server for NFS service. ESXi will then mount the shares again.
In order to find it you must use mmc.exe (Management Console) and open the Services for NFS snap-in go to Server for NFS and right click properties.
Its interesting that the Version 3 tickbox in the NFS Server Manager settings, doesn't do the same thing, though I'm sure there is a "logical" decision for this by Microsoft.
Disable version 4, restart the NFS service and reboot the VMWare box. You only need one of them and definatelly not both for the same share.

Alex H has the right idea, however I'm adding this to the original question to help anyone else that gets this issue, specifically for NFS on Windows Server 2012 R2. Turns out the error reported by ESXi is indeed correct. Despite having NFS 3.0 or 4.1 enabled via NFS settings properties in Server Manager, ESXi won't mount the NFS shares. Why? Because the critical setting is actually elsewhere...
