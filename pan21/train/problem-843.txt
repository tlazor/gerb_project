If its Windows 7, the time taken is incredibly long, especially if its set to use Windows update to scan for drivers on /every/ connect. That plus my flaky, flaky and slow Internet connection which resulted in timeouts means it took forever to detect. Asked Windows not to look at Windows update, and it was much better.
On my windows system here, I just plugged in a regular Â£2.99 mouse, it started working instantly. Unplugged my G5, rebooted, and plugged it back in. About half a second (I guess mostly for setpoint to initialise).
At school? Takes 30 seconds on boot before peripherals start functioning, 20 if you plug them in after-the-fact. I think it's configuration error, most likely.
Windows and pretty much any other OS have completely different structure.It is possible that Unix based OSes(any operating system these days except Windows) can make a safe assumption about the hardware that Windows can't.Leading to Windows "asking" that piece of hardware if it's true or not and then proceeding based on the info provided by the device.What I explained up here is called "handshaking" but I omitted a lot of actual reasons why is handshaking necessary.
Is the hardware comparable?  If your Windows box is not the same as your Mac you would expect different response times.  On my own Windows systems, it takes less than a second to recognize my mice.
