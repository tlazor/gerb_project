I used the wizard to create a time dimension.  Part of that configuration is selecting a date range.
Take a look at the Time Dimension properties dialog. Expand the Source node and change the CalendarStartDate or CalendarEndDate to suit your needs. Then Reprocess the Dimension.
and it looks like in your case you dont have a table for it in the datasource, i mean you chose a server time dimension which creates a dimension in Analysis server itself.
I did find that I could open the dimension, go to properties, and redefine the date range there.  I saved and reprocessed the dimension, but the actual date range in the table is not growing to include the newly-added dates.
Is your Time dimension connected to a source or is it a Server time dimension which has no table for it in the Data source

but if you chose the other option "Generate a time table in the data source" This option creates a time dimension table in the underlying data source and populates the same with data based on the inputs provided.
