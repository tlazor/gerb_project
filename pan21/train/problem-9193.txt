To keep the system from cacheing credentials, edit the RDP file with notepad and change the PromptCredentialOnce:i:1 parameter to PromptCredentialOnce:i:0
You could modify the registry of the system to disable cached logon credentials.  Set the registry key to 0.  This will require a reboot after each change.  This also assumes you don't have a GPO that sets this key.
The way to modify cached credentials stored is (oddly enough) by modifying the security options\Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache policy via group policy editor (gpedit)
I was able to clear all stored passwords by setting all of the NL$ entries to the same as the last one (the last few NL$ entries were the same so it looks like they are just placeholders).  I tested this on Windows 7 PRO 64bit computers, I have not tested it on anything else.
The handiest way to remove stored credentials is to run MSTSC and enter the name or ip address of the terminal server that is cached.  If it was cached as the fully qualified domain name, that is what you must enter, it will likely fill the field in for you as well as your domain\username.  Then click Options.  If credentials are stored, you may edit or delete them.
