We haven't changed anything recently and everything has been working well until now. Does this look like a problem with the ISP (Comcast) or something at our end? We've been through the initial "reboot the modem" thing with Comcast but I'm at a bit of a loss to know what to do next.
The Comcast modem is on the WAN side of pfSense. Our LAN is on 192.168.1.x. It's been working fine for months.
It seems to go reasonably well speed wise after a modem reboot but slows down when we push any significant traffic from our LAN. It seems to stay slow even after that traffic stops.
We are having internet problems today. We use a Comcast business connection. We have a /29 network from Comcast. We have these IP address:
Could someone please confirm the following test setup in case I'm missing something obvious. I disconnect the modem from the pfSense WAN and connect the modem to a Windows laptop. I set the laptop IP address to 50.x.x.249, the mask to 255.255.255.248 and gateway to 50.x.x.254. If I do that, I can't get to anywhere, not even the gateway. Everything is "not reachable". I've tried two different computers. I'm sure the cable between the computer and modem is okay so I don't know why that doesn't work or why pfSense does work, at least somewhat.
Why on earth is that 100.99.197.221 showing up? It seems like pfSense went there as the first hop instead of our gateway. According to http://whois.domaintools.com/100.99.197.221 that is in Belarus but I've read RFC6598 and I don't think it is supposed to be publicly routable. If I do a traceroute to 100.99.197.221 from a different connection, it really does go to Belarus (.by) and takes quite a few hops to get there so the one hope from my LAN to that address doesn't seem real.
