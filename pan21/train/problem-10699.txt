After reading through this link: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/application-data-circular-reference/746342b2-0119-4461-a3d7-610c435a6715
My Windows 7 Enterprise computer has been crashing fairly frequently recently, so I decided to boot up in safe mode and run the TrendMicro client I have installed. It froze about 10 minutes into the full system scan, so in the spirit of http://whathaveyoutried.com, I started scanning each folder individually. When I got to ProgramData, the AV failed with an uncaught exception. I then went down a level and tried scanning Application Data, which failed as well. Imagine my surprise when I open the folder just to see the same folder again!
I think that these circular referencing links are normal, but under usual circumstances, they are hidden by the operating system. I had forced a permissions and ownership change of all files on my C:\ some time ago, and I think in the process that these links became 'unhidden'. 
As far as I can tell, this folder loop continues indefinitely. (If you are trying to recreate this, keep in mind that ProgramData is a hidden folder.) I'm actually a bit concerned that these are system folders, as this is a brand-new computer with a clean installation.
You TrendMicro just runs in an infinity loop reopening the link to the own directory again and again... and crashes that way.
