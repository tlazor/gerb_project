I agree with those others who have suggested that it's likely the nexenta is ignoring requests from "offsite" addresses as some kind of half-arsed security feature. If the approaches others have suggested don't help, and nexenta can't tell you how to reconfigure the box to disable this feature, you might consider trying to "bounce" the connection off a local box (meaning one on the same subnet as the Nexenta) running sshd.
NexentaStor might be ignoring your traffic based on your IP. In which case, you will need to either reconfigure the NexentaStor to allow this (if possible), or use NAT so that the device will see you as coming from within its network.
The details of ssh port forwarding are pretty widely-documented, but the upshot would be to make a connection from your desktop (client) to server (the box on the same network as nexenta) as follows:
We are able to access the NMV (port 80) on Nexenta Enterprise from a different network over a VPN tunnel without having done anything special in the Nexenta configuration.  Be sure the netmask and default gateway are set correctly in the network configuration on your Nexenta server.
I recommend contacting Nexenta support, or this is not an option, to reach out to #Nexenta on irc.freenode.org.
9 times out of 10, this is not NexentaStor at all, except that the default port, 2000, is one claimed by Cisco. Login to the appliance using SSH as root, and type "setup appliance init" and then hit No to the first question then it asks for HTTP/HTTPS and the port to use - you can use HTTP or HTTPS, but change the port to something else, I use 7878. Then try again. This is typically a Cisco ASA or other firewall filtering port 2000 that causes this symptom.
