I doubt that your netbook has a TPM chip. My HP dv9000 has a fingerprint reader without a TPM chip as well. I also use BitLocker with a USB key. A sure-fire way to see if you have a TPM chip is to run the TPM Management Console (tpm.msc) as an administrator. If you have one it'll show you options relating to managing the TPM and if you don't, well, it'll let you know that too.
If you use this option you'll use a USB key to boot (meaning you'll need to keep it with you) and if you loose your USB key there is a recovery key (print it or save it on another computer) that'll let you in. Whenever I travel with my laptop I have my laptop in my bag and have the USB key in my pocket, in case I'm ever separated from it. Believe it or not, it isn't that much trouble to make sure you bring the key, you'll forget it once and that experience will make sure you never forget it again! (Anyone who's had this happen will agree with me I think)
TPM's require drivers in Windows, so I'd say go check your Device Manager (orb->right-click "Computer"->Manage->Device Manager)
I have a HP Mini 311-1000CA netbook running Windows 7 Ultimate.  I'd really like to encrypt the harddrive using BitLocker but I am unsure as to how to work out if the Mini has a TPM chip or not.
If that's not conclusive, then figure out how to get into your netbook's BIOS and you can probably check there, as the TPM can usually be enabled or disabled there (if there is one).
Well, I guess that bringing a USB with you whenever you use a computer is inconvenient,and TPM is the best choice, but if your computer doesn't have a TPM, use a Pre-boot PIN to use BitLocker, so that you need the password to unlock your hard drive, and you should also add a password to each User Accounts in Windows, and enable the "Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to logon" option to reduce the chance of some trojan attacks. Because there're a lot of hackers out there somewhere that wanted to steal your information.
