I made some assumptions since people generally blog about the harder stuff they are working on, the fact that you are blogging about very entry level programming stuff brought me to this conclusion. Not a bad thing, but you need to realize there is a long road to get where you're trying to be, you can't just jump there.
You need to create 2-6 which would include many object oriented projects with atleast 10 different classes before you can make an rpg. Once you do that and you come back to this site, you won't have such general questions like "how do I make my game", instead you will ask beneficial specific questions.
I noticed you posted a "Pythagorean Theorem Solver". Your answer will be closed on this site because it's a bad fit for QA sites. It needs to be more specific and not a plea for help.
I sent here a link of my UNFINISHED or STARTED demo of the game...there's nothing in it yet but do please study what you can do about it.
