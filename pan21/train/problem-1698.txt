This AC to DC converter's purpose is to supply the right voltage and sufficient current (or power, since P=IV).
I have a monitor and a laptop and their chargers together are 91W. Both of them are 19V. So I was wondering whether I could just use a 90W charger and a cheap one male to two female 5.5x2.1mm splitter and adequate plug converters. Is there any danger to either the laptop or the monitor? I am not sure whether a laptop charger needs to be anything special or it just needs to supply the right voltage and amperage.
The brick which are calling a "charger" is not actually a charger.  It's an AC to DC converter.  Monitor and the laptop each have their own built-in charge controllers (and do those special things that keep Lithium batteries out of trouble).
If you execute this correctly, there is likely no danger to the monitor or the laptop.  Be aware, however, that AC to DC converters should (and usually do) have over-current protection.  So, if your equipment pulls more current from the AC to DC converter than it can supply, then the converter may shut off.
