Additionally - Below I have included a few bullet points for other unresolved errors listed within my errors_log file as I don't know if any of this is helpful.
If you've not already done so, configure your server to save core files and get a stack trace from a crash using gdb, e.g. 'gdb /usr/sbin/httpd core' then enter bt at the prompt.
I have gone through the httpd error_log as the web host suggested and I did find a bunch of issues being reported by php for each of the 5 wordpress 3.0 sites. Mainly related to missing php include files and things like that all which I ended up resolving.
Naturally I would like to know exactly why this is happening so I can not only resolve this problem right now but also know how to correctly diagnose a problem like this in the future.
The dedicated server I have is running Linux and Plesk 9.5 and has 1gb of ram and is only really running 5 websites which don't get a significant amount of traffic.
Unfortunately, none of the issue I fixed seem to have been related to apache crashing so my question to you guys here is what do I do next.
In any case I am just looking for the exact steps you experts would use to diagnose and resolve this.
My web hosts solution was to just add more ram but although this "may" be the actual reason I can't believe these 5 sites are sucking so much ram.
The problem is that PHP (or I guess Apache) seems to be crashing randomly and almost on a daily basis.
Its probably a very specific request which is causing the error - IIRC, both the access and error log are written after processing completes - IIRC mod_security can log requests when they arrive (including post vars) - switching this on would be a good idea until you know what causes the crash.
