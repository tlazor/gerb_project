If your other sites use different domain names you can purchase a multi domain SSL certificate (also known as UCC or SAN Certificate) that cover up to 100 different domains. There are some issues with these which may be important depending on your situation. The certificate details list all the other domains covered. This information is only really visible if someone clicks the lock in their browser and checks the certificate details. You cannot change the certificate after purchase so if you want to add or remove domains listed on the cert you will need to purchase a new one (although this varies between certificate suppliers). 
I want to enable SSL for multiple servers hosted on it. Can I bind SSL for all such servers via single IP or do I need to purchase IP for each server. Any link to guide, tutorial will be really helpful.
If your sites are all subdomains of one main domain name then you could use a wildcard certificate that covers *.example.com. This binds to one IP address but will cover for instance: site1.example.com, site2.example.com
I am using Virtualmin (GPL) to manage my servers. I have multiple sites hosted on it binded to single IP address. 
Generaly one SSL certificate is for one domain and binds to one IP address. To have independent SSL certs for each site you will need to purchase additional IP addresses.
You can use different SSL-cert for different hosts on the same IP only if each SSL-server will be binded to different SSL-ports
I have already gone through http://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/tutorial/how-to-add-multidomain-ssl-certificate which helps me to bind SSL for multiple server but with individual IP.
