The only Dell software that you really need is DSET and LSI_megaRAID, and you only need it when you want to feed the Dell's hardware support folks during the failure/problem. Don't worry, all other bloatware is not needed for a properly functioning Linux system and Dell support never required anything else. Well you cannot resize the RAID online, but that's about it.
I tried installing CentOS 7.1 on it and it installed without a problem, so I could start using the system as of now. But what do I miss if I don't install any software from Dell?
According to the Dell Support page for the R510, Dell supports RHEL 6 but not RHEL7. Dell supports RHEL7 for some other 11G servers but the R510 is not one of them.
I have a Dell PowerEdge R510 and I want to install the latest version of CentOS on it (currently 7.1) so I can maintain the system with updates. RHEL is supported by Dell, so I assume CentOS can be installed also. Tricking the Dell software in believing it's RHEL being installed on should do the trick?
