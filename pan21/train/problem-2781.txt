You could connect through a reverse SSH tunnel. Configure your router to forward some port (say 2222/tcp) to a local SSH server on your side. Have the remote user establish a reverse SSH tunnel from the host running the VNC server to your public IP address (a.b.c.d):
Once the tunnel is established, you can connect with the VNC client your SSH server's IP address, e.g.
I need to use VNC to control a computer behind a NAT.  I have no access to the remote router, but I can have the person sitting in front of the computer follow very simple instructions.  I'm also behind a NAT, but I can set up port forwarding if needed.  The connection is Win to Win and I was thinking of using UltraVNC.  I have no previous experience with VNC. So far from what I've read I've got two ideas:
zero tier is another alternative to hamachi which is open source.  You can use it to easily get the computer onto a shared vpn which you can then remote desktop or ssh into from there.
I then got him to install UltraVNC Server whilst I installed the viewer. Connect using the VPN IP address - voila. Any remote control software will then run over the VPN, it doesn't have to be VNC.
When try to help my 80 year old Dad remotely I have used a VPN to avoid all the NAT/Firewall etc issues. I used Logmein Hamachi to create a virtual network then got him to install Hamachi and join the network with the user name/password. Simple and hopefully secure connectivity.
