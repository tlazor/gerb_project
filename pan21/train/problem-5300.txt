I'm intrigued about the device your building. You're after the reliability of an embedded device while using a filesystem that isn't really suited.
Ext4 (and family) is a fine general purpose filesystem with (I guess) many billions of hours of use on varied hardware and use cases. However, what your asking for doesn't really fit with ext4. The pointers from voretaq7 and Giovanni will help get the best out of using ext4 if you have to, but the real answer is to use something more suited to your requirements. Steve has given you a couple of options. If you keep pulling power from an ext4 FS you'll eventually get a mess.
If this is a product that you intend to widely deploy/bring to market you have the choice to use something more suitable. Or you take the business decision to support a percentage of the devices that will brick every year and either need replacing or manual intervention to recover them.
If this is a one off system that you're building you should make the choice to use something more suitable or accept that there will be problems at some point. It might only be 1 power outage out of 100 or 1 out of 1000. That could be good enough for you to take the risk and the device could likely run for a long time (years) without any manual intervention.
