I am trying to make it so non administrator users cannot delete files on network shares. I've setup my NTFS permissions to do this and all seems to be working except when a user goes to save a new file onto the shared drive it throws an error stating they do not have permission to do this but looks like the file still saves. I still want them to be able to create new files just not delete files since a lot of them are standard forms that they edit for clients and save as new files specifically for them.  Is there a better way of doing this? or maybe some other permission I am missing to have this work properly? 
They problem you are going to run in to is that many programs handle saving by using "write to a new file, delete the old one, rename the new file to the old name" behavior. Denying delete access will prevent these kinds of applications from successfully saving.
Additionally, I would enable File Level Auditing so that if someone does delete something they shouldn't, you can find exactly who, and when.  
Give them "Modify" for the folder but read-only for the files. This way they're able to save files into the directory but not delete them afterward. This does have a side effect of making them uneditable, but you'd want that too. After all, someone could just blank the file or make subtle changes to make them unreliable.
Instead, I suggest you make sure you have a good backup system in place and utilize the Volume Shadow Copies (VSS Snapshots) feature, to cover accidental deletions/ modifications between backups.  
I think you are playing with fire on this.  Messing with the NTFS permissions to this level is going to create a management nightmare for you and future admins.  The solution isn't scalable and will likely just cause more issues than fixes.
