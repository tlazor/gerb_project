Whatever you do, if you transmit things wireless they can be intercepted an cracked. But it might require more effort than it is worth.
How hard this is depends on a lot of things. Cracking ancient WEP encryption takes about 10 seconds on a mid level computer. You might as well not use it. 
So much for the wireless part. There is however a second layer of encryption which you are likely using: SSL/TLS. The website should not allow you to log in via plain HTTP. You should be on a HTTPS.  That allows the website to encrypt the communication between you and the website. (And any sensible website will have that enabled).  Which would add a second layer of encryption which also needs to be cracked.
WPA2 still seems adequate today. Cracking a WPA2 link with a decent password can be done. The last article I read on that used a dozen amazon instances with massive GPU support and then it took about a day to crack it.  This means two things:  1) Right now WPA2 is probably secure enough unless someone is very determined.  2) In a few years when computers will be faster, it will be to weak.
