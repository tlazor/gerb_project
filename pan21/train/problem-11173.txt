Can somebody recommend user-friendly program that will create ( or convert from Excel & Word, or OpenOffice) editable pdf forms. You know like tax forms, that some of us filled out. Where you can create a form with predefined format and stationary, but let user edit/fill out fields. I need something user-friendly that a regular person can use. I'm NOT looking for a pdf library ( I already use wkhtmltopdf for generating pdfs programmaticaly). The reason is that we have about 400 documents ( internal expense forms, traing forms, etc) in .doc and .xls format that we want to convert to editable pdf ( so that people don't have to fill them out by hand). Coding 400 templates and then converting them using some lib or command line tool - is not my idea of fun, espsecially since those form change all the time. I'd like to just give HR and Quality department the tool, so that they can maintain those documents. 
I looked at everything listed on this page ( http://www.cogniview.com/convert-pdf-to-excel/post/pdf-editing-creation-50-open-sourcefree-alternatives-to-adobe-acrobat/ ), but can't find what I need.
