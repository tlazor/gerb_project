I found there are corresponding log entries in /var/log/mail.log that do contain the IP address of the attacker and can therefore be blocked with fail2ban (at least on Ubuntu 14.04). Try searching for "SASL LOGIN authentication failed".
There are a variety of mechanisms for either rate-limiting smtp connections per source address or blocking addresses with a high rate of authentication failures.  You can use iptables for the former or something like fail2ban for the latter.
However, as far as i know, Sendmail DOES record the IP, and you could point fail2ban at that instead, by writing a rule for Sendmail, instead of using the provided saslauthd jail.
this is a bit late, but im fairly certain that saslauthd does not log the IP address because of some limitation within the saslauthd library and its implementation.
My linux sendmail server is being forced out of commission by a flood of invalid smtp saslauthd logins.
If that doesn't work, you can use the tcpdump to find out who's connecting to your system.  If you run it like this:
Sendmail logs to the LOG_MAIL facility, which is usually sent to something like /var/log/mail or /var/log/maillog, depending on your operating system.  Consult your local /etc/syslog.conf for details. You may find something useful there.
