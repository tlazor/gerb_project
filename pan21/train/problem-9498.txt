In Office 365, I was able to record my two Excel sorts as macros and link them to shortcut keys so that I can easily switch back and forth. I would not recommend using recorded macros for a notebook that is already using VBA for other purposes. However, this does make it possible to accomplish a "switch view" type functionality in an Excel notebook without requiring knowledge of VBA. 
You don't need any code for this. Just select the cells in the header when you are customizing your sort. And the sorting criteria will be saved. Tested OK on Excel 2010.
This free add-in provides what you asked for. The code is unprotected so you can see how it works: https://sites.google.com/site/beyondexcel/project-updates/savesortsfilterscolumnsettings
In the end, I would create 4 or 5 named sorts and a button for each on the worksheet.  Then would be able to select any range of rows, from any table, and click one of the sort buttons.  The sort would execute.
On an Excel 2007 worksheet, I have several tables, each sharing the same columns.  For every table, I sort in several particular ways, depending on the task at hand.  It gets tedious going to the Data tab, clicking Sort, unchecking the "my data has headers" checkbox, then add/removing the columns and ordering sort criteria.
