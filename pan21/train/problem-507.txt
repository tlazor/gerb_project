Without knowing more about the BSOD, I can't say much. However, in most cases, it's indicative of a driver issue. Is the hardware of your destination machine different in anyway from your source machine? 
Unfortunately, I've used Acronis, Macrium, DriveImage XML, Clonezilla, Paragon, and the imaging utility built into Windows 7 to try this. Everything says it completes correctly, but when the cloned hard drive is booted it gets to the black screen that says "Starting Windows", then blue screens for a split second and reboots. Then it goes to startup repair. I've let that run, but it doesn't fix anything.
Now reboot and check, whether the problem is solved. In most cases, the Booting problem should vanish, and your Windows should boot normally.
I have been trying for about three weeks to clone a Windows 7 hard drive to get it to run in another computer. Where I work, we have 600+ computers that need Windows 7 installed on them before support for XP runs out. We have volume licensing with Microsoft so that's not an issue.
Having said that, for 600+ machines, I would suggest setting up an Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) share. It is very easy to setup and you can target model specific drivers during the build. There are plenty of websites and books out there which can walk you through the whole process. Google "MDT 2012 tutorial" or something similar.
