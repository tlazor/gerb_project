Scrolling can be a tossup depending on your pad; recent Wacom's have a pretty good programmable wheel, but I find mouse slightly easier.
Precise clicking on small areas.  Any action-based computer game (they're really not designed for tablets).  Some tasks which need frequent mouse/keyboard switching - I find it easier to go from keyboard to mouse than to pad.  (This is personal preference; try for yourself).
Tablet/stylus uses very different hand motions and postures than the mouse, so it can help with some wrist injuries even if it's no easier to use.  A good tablet isn't always cheap, so try before you buy if possible - some people love them, others can't use them.
Please don't vote to close it as irrelevant so quickly. I am suffering from finger pain due to too much clicking, then someone suggest I use a pad and stylus, so I am wondering whether it can avoid clicking/tapping by the fingers, at the same time provide me the basic function of a mouse.
Drag-and-drop, box-select, all graphics / image editing work.  If your pad has macro buttons or programmable areas, some routine tasks can be made easier with well-chosen macro controls.
