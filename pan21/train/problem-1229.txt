How to I go about identifying the spam-source? The server itself is a fresh install and it "started spamming" as soon as I transfered domains, data and databases from the old server (which didn't spam). The SMTP server definately needs secure authentication (it is not an open relay). I also checked for rootkits using rkhunter and chkrootkit while the servers filesystem was mounted readonly from another machine and found none.
One of my smaller webservers appears to be sending out spam. It is a Ubuntu 8.04 system with Plesk as a configutation interface and qmail as the mailserver.
You should be looking at your apache logs. You can give it a try and scan the webserver root directories with clamav (it has patterns to find php "mailer kits" or other nasty things).
Don't do forensic on the live system, take the machine off the net, look at the logs. When not abolutely sure where the problem is, assume 3. (nuke the box, reinstall, audit the web code, permit only key authentication)
It's definitely being abused?  First of all, disconnect it from the Web, and secure the logs.  The source of the spam is either a) a local process that's been installed / compromised (like you say), b) or a bot somewhere using your server.  In either case, the logs will tell you where to look next.  I'd be worried either way, as this could be the thin end of the wedge.
