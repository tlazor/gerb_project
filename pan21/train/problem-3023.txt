There are other more complex ways of handling it as well, but that's pretty simple enough to implement in a test lab environment.
Enabling the NIC interface on the 10.0.0.0 subnet with a default gateway would cause the machine to have 2 default gateways which won't work.
You have MULTIPLE choices here, and I won't go into all of them, but ONE choice would be remove the default gateway on the 10.0.2.0 NIC and leave the DG on the 10.0.0.0 NIC.  That would allow internet access.  Then to get the route to the 10.0.0.1 network you would put back in a static route on the local server to get there.  If your old DG was 10.0.2.1 then make the route to the 10.0.0.0 network use that IP as its next-hop and it would work as it did before.
You said "I don't get internet" which leads me to believe the 10.0.0.0 network is the one with actual internet routing/connectivity.
Other alternatives are to route everything on the L3 switches or routers themselves (meaning in your case allow the 10.0.2.0 network through either the router or if the problem lies on the firewall change it there so that it can now reach the internet), or you can do the same as I mentioned in the previous paragraph but instead of a static route on the server, fix the routing on the router/DG of the 10.0.0.0 network so that it knows about the 10.0.0.1 network and can route the traffic from the 10.0.2.0 network to the 10.0.1.0 network properly.
The answer is basic networking...which is why I posted my sarcastic comment.  If you have full access to routers/firewalls then I would hope you knew at least basic networking to set those up.
Enabling it without a default gateway works because traffic the local routing table doesn't specifically know about would traverse the computers existing default gateway from the other NIC.
