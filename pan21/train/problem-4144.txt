The more stuff you install on a system the more likely it is that something has a bug that can be exploited.  OTOH, a minimal windowing environment that isn't left running shouldn't result in any significant increase in security exposure or performance problems.
If you do decide you actually need to do this, I suggest that you disable GDM/KDM.  So the X server isn't left running when you don't need it.  Instead, just fire it up by logging into the console and running startx.
I don't know how much value enabling a GUI will actually give you.  Most of the things that you need to do to manage a server you are going to have to do in a terminal anyway.  The things that a GUI might help you with are probably things you are going to have to learn anyway to deal with services that don't have any GUI tools for managing them.
I like XFCE, it is light, if you are just looking for a file-browser this may be help you some.  But I think it doesn't matter what you choose, most of the desktop environments aren't really aimed at managing a server.
Depending on the kinds of things you need to manage, there are also options like Webmin to manage DNS, users, apache. I've only used with some other hosts, but it seems to work pretty well.
