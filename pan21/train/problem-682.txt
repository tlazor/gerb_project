Chroot into mnt then you can recreate initrd this will rebuild the initrd system and include the drivers required to mount the physical drive, rather than the virtual drive in the virtual install. See the link below for details. In my case I had installed an image from suse studio then transferred it to a real drive. Once you get it working remember to remove the vmware tools to stop the boot time error. ( yast - software - search vm.
Specifying the hard drive by-path might not be ideal in some cases, but it worked perfectly for the quick fix I was going for.
The problem occurs because the virtual machine uses Pata driver and the initrd does not have the driver to mount the physical drive. Novel FAQ had the answer you need to mount the drive using a recover disk, mount the device under /mnt then mount the sys proc and dev directories.
The paths that I used specify the first hard disk. If you want to boot off a different hard disk (or a different disk type), you will need to figure out how SUSE maps the path. I found that SUSE will mount a second hard drive as pci-0000:00:0d.0-scsi-1:0:0:0.
This problem is caused because SUSE by default configures Grub to find disks by name rather than by label or by path. When creating a VM from an appliance, VirtualBox creates a new disk with a new name and then Grub can't find the boot disk. I was able to fix this permanently by:
5) Rename all files in this folder replacing there current name with the name of the device you took note of in step 1. Ex. mv ata-VBOX_OLDNAME....-part2 ata-VBOX_HARDDISK....-part2
