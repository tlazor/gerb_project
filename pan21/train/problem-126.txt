I'd actually rather suggest buying an unmanaged switch (if you really just need very basic connectivity) or a Catalyst (if you actually need a managed switch) instead of one of these.
personally I wouldn't recommend the Small Business Line from Cisco for the office environment. Especially not for connecting servers. Their flexibility is very limited and their throughput might not serve your needs.
Does anyone have any experience with these switches? are there are better products for similar money?
If all it's ever going to is handle your management traffic and nothing else then I'm sure it'll be fine. Personally I like all switches to have dual PSUs but if it's just for DRAC then why not?
Don't think that the Cisco 'Small Business' switches are going to give you quality close to their Catalyst/IOS line. They're really very basic switches designed for a single-switch office running on Windows.
Their management interface is very basic and poorly designed and depending on the firmware version, may only work in IE.
Instead you might want to look at the Cisco Catalyst Access-Switches instead (C2960 for example), even if it's a bit more expensive. If you're about costs you even might to think about refurbished Cisco equipment.
