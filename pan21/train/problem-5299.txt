I believe that windows (as in the plural of window, not the OS) can remember the last position that they were opened in. If you open your browser and drag it to the second monitor, it might help. Also, check your display settings. Sometimes, there are different modes. (clone/extend) Perhaps messing with that may help. Also, look at nVidia / ATI control panel settings.
Because you can have as many windows as you like, the "other window" quickly becomes meaningless. There isn't really a perfect solution to this problem, as far as I'm aware, but one way you could speed up the process is by dragging the link in question directly to the tab bar of the second window. This should open it up in that window, saving you a mouse movement.
So, if the second monitor is to the right of the main monitor, drag the tab past the right edge of the monitor. Hey presto!
i just did a little surfing and people reccommend ultramon not sure if it is free but apparently it adds a button to send maximized to the other monitor
all i could suggest is that you use shift + click to open the link in a new window and search the internet for an easy way to send the window maximised to the other monitor
