iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE -m comment --comment "Masquerade OpenVPN traffic"
The problem I'm having is that a VPN client will connect fine, but can't reach anything on the internet. 
If I use tshark to watch tun0 I can see DNS queries being performed, but there doesn't appear to be any response:
I copied the configuration from a known working server so I was pretty sure the server was configured correctly.
