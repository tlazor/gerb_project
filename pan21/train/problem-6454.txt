Two thing to check, is the lan card enabled in the BIOS and is it visible in device manager. If it is visible in device manager then delete it and do a scan for new hardware to allow it to redetect itself.
For now, I can plug in a USB wireless adapter and I have network access, but this is a pain as I'd prefer to be hardwired.  For the record, there is nothing wrong with the actual Ethernet port.  The system is an Ubuntu/Windows dual-boot setup, and all works fine in Linux.
If your wireless connection shows up in your Network Connections folder, at least the folder itself is working (I've seen it completely corrupt before and that required a Windows reinstall >.>).  
It all started with a Virtualbox network bridging issue.  So I deleted all network connections with the hope of being able to set them all back up.  Things actually found themselves on the first go-round, but I started having the same issues at which point I uninstalled and reinstalled Virtualbox.  It was at that point that all my "Local Network Connection" went away for good, never to be seen again.
My suggestion would be to reinstall the network adapter, as this creates a new connection and rebuilds its networking stack:
I'm having a bit of a Windows XP SP3 networking issue.  Basically I have lost my "Local Network Connection" and nothing I do brings it back.  I've tried Add/Remove Hardware, I've uninstalled and reinstalled all network related drivers (or all I was aware of) and nothing works.
