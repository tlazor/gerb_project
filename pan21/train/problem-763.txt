There are ways to fix the problem, but it requires building some extra vertex data and adding some code to the shader.  The basic idea is to sample the displacement map on both sides of the seam, and interpolate the resulting displacement values smoothly across the seam so that there's no sharp discontinuity.  A bit more detail can be found in the "My Tessellation Has Cracks" talk by Bryan Dudash, listed on this page.
Once you've gotten things working for a constant displacement value you can put back in the texture-based displacement, but you'll see cracks again.  With irregularly shaped UV seams it's impossible in general to make the textures match up precisely across the seam (it can be done if the seam is perfectly horizontal or vertical in UV space and both sides of the seam are precisely the same length).
Try hard-coding a constant displacement value, such as 1.0.  If you still get cracks when using a constant displacement then look at your displacement vectors.  How are you calculating them?  They need to be exactly, bit-for-bit, equal across the seams; any discrepancy in how they're calculated could lead to cracking.  If you're using the vertex normal as a displacement vector, ensure that the normals in the mesh are exactly equal cross the seams.
