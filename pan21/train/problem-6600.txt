Judging by your mention that "it has some type of bug that sets the clock and calendar to some random time in the past", it sounds like your time zone is configured incorrectly in Windows.  If it is also configured to automatically sync with a time server, that could set it back several hours.  An incorrect time zone will also mean that websites using the JavaScript method getTimezoneOffset to set times based on your local time zone will be receiving incorrect information, and thus display times incorrectly.
Click the time/date in the bottom right corner, click 'change time and date settings', then hit 'change time zone' button in the bottom half of the default screen (date and time)
The main point I'm trying to make here, is that it does not matter what time your local PC is set to.  Even logically it wouldn't make sense if it did, or you would be able to post data from the past or future.
To verify your time zone settings and correct them if needed in Windows Vista and 7, right click on the clock on the taskbar and select Adjust date/time, then select Change time zone....  In Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows, right-click on the clock and choose Properties, and select the Time Zone tab.
Alternatively, if you are not given the option to do so, ensure that you have set your location properly.  Some websites base their event timers off of the timezone set by your location.
Had a similar problem.. Though my windows time was set properly, my windows timezone was 3 hours off, so posts on Twitter, etc would say 'tweeted 3 hours ago'
TCP/IP events registered by a remote machine are flagged using their local time, not yours.  Nothing you send to a website carries a timestamp from your local machine.  This is usually a site-dependent setting (if you wish to set your timezone).  Ensure that you have set the timezone in your user settings to your local timezone.
