There are different techniques to do feature engineering in classification tasks, regardless of the number of classes. I have recently used K-means to bin all continuous variables to k bins, where k is equal to the # of classes in my classification problem. You can either add k new columns to your data set (in addition to the existing columns/features) or only use these k bins. In some scenarios, this solution works perfectly and based on my experience augmenting your current feature set with these new k columns works much better than using only the k identifier (due to information loss in later scenario).
I am working on a 3 class classification problem. I am curious on what is the best way to bin continuous variables for this problem.
I am not sure how I can apply similar logic in case of 3 class problem or if there are any other ways of binning.
When I worked previously on 2 class problems, for examples sale conversion or not, I used to calculate conversion rate metric to decide bins on continuous variables and tried to create bins with different conversion rates.
