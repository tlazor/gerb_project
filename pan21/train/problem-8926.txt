Even a state-of-the-art 3x3 (3 spacial streams) HT40 (40MHz-wide channels), short guard interval 802.11n Wi-Fi chipset is only going to get about 200 mbps of actual throughput, so USB 2.0 hi-speed's 480 mbps has plenty of headroom.
USB dongle might be stolen or lost easily... On modern PCs internal card might be occupying the only PCI port.. 
You can't move an internal card to another system easily, especially not a laptop. You're also stuck with your antennas being on the back of your CPU up against the wall underneath your desk (or whatever). With a USB device, you can take it to any machine, and with a USB cable, you can position it anywhere, where it can get the best signal.
With current technology, really the only difference is that an internal card will not use up one of your USB ports, and a USB dongle will not use up an internal PCI slot, so it's up to you in terms of which is the more plentiful resource on your computer.
It's feasible that someday, connection speeds will be so great that they exceed USB transfer rates, but we aren't anywhere near there yet, so in terms of speed they're pretty much equivalent. Some people just prefer not to have a little stick poking out of their computer whenever they go online (and thus choose internal), and some other people like to move the wireless capability from computer to computer, or have it easily removable in the case of supervising internet usage of a child (and thus choose USB).
