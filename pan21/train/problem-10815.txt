Its more related to powerloss. Loss of power somehow causes port forwarding rules to get deleted. Not always but only sometimes.
The symptoms of a missing default gateway is that your LAN PCs can access the server running inside the guest just fine, but external users from the internet cannot connect.
Example: If the same machine (one MAC address) boots up different operating systems/hostnames, Fritz gets confused, and that affects port forwarding. Also if you use the "specific IP address" the port forwarding configuration, but then later change/add a machine config with the same IP address, the port forwarding changes to point to that machine "name" instead of the IP.
In my findings, it's related not to the port forwarding itself, but the Fritz notion and behaviour of the destination machine ("to computer" field in your screenshot).
In case you landed on this page because you can't reach a server running inside a Xen Guest from the internet (but can connect locally), then read on...
In summary: try to clean up the machine/MAC list in Fritz (in "Home Network > Home Network Overview > Network Connections"), making sure there's no conflicts, and re-create the forwarding rules. That should fix it.
