What makes the difference is the increased space between the fans on the bottom of the laptop and the surface below it.  Usually most people angle the laptop by propping something under the back end which would increase the gap.  But if you only angle it by changing the angle of the surface it's sitting on, but the space between the fans and the surface doesn't increase, then you won't see any improvement in cooling. 
It does make it cooler as it allows for better airflow - however, it was far from critical/dangerous in the first place.
I have a couple of laptops that run very warm. I generally do this and it does seem to reduce the time and amount that the fans run. However whenever possible I use active cooling because I found several really cheap usb coolers on Ebay, shipped for $10-$12. For this price I get a laptop that when I turn it off is actually cool to the touch, and this isn't just around the fan but the whole case and battery is cool.
I use an external monitor and keyboard, so it doesn't matter if the laptop is in a horizontal position and it seems a very simple way to improve cooling. My only concern is the hard drive, but probably it doesn't care if it's not completely horizontal.
According to Wikipedia "heat build-up in notebooks is reduced by 15 to 20 percent, when a laptop is situated at an angle compared to a laptop in a horizontal position". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop_cooler
