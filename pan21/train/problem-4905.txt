There may even be a correlation, but it does not necessarily imply causation. If the disk consistently works with the old BIOS but fails with the new one, it might mean the new BIOS version has something wrong with it that causes the failure in accessing the disk. Or it might just mean the new BIOS has more strict criteria for disk health than the old one (shorter timeouts, perhaps?) and you should take this as an early warning that your system disk might be about to die soon.
You should also check the BIOS release notes: your system has a built-in HP Smart Array P420i hardware RAID controller. There might be a requirement to update the hardware RAID controller firmware (separate from the BIOS) to a specific version before upgrading the BIOS. A mismatch in versions could cause the BIOS to fail to access the RAID controller, and thus fail to boot.
The Attempting Boot From Hard Drive (C:) - Read Error message comes from BIOS. HP (and Compaq before it) historically wrote their BIOS error messages in a DOS/Windows-centric way. It just means it's trying to boot from whatever is set as the primary boot disk, and failing.
I would recommend taking any necessary steps to check the health of your system disk(s), just in case. By the symptoms it might be that your system disk is dying, particularly if this was a first reboot in a long time. 
When updating bios the active bios gets put in the backup bios and the updated bios is put in the current bios.
When switching to backup bios it becomes current and what is in the current gets put in the backup slot.
