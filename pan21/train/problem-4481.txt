Yes, there is.  Depending on how much control you're giving the user over the content, it could range from "user can do mischief" to "you're a total open relay".
As an example more at the "mischief" end of the spectrum, Redis has a fairly "permissive" command parser.  It will ignore any commands it doesn't recognise, and then wait for a command it does.  That means that if the user sends an e-mail containing the string "flushall" at the beginning of a line, and sends that e-mail to an open Redis server on the Internet (yes, people leave their Redis servers open to the Internet, however silly that may sound) all of the data in that Redis server will be deleted.
Of course, the miscreant doesn't have to use your service to do that -- they can send the commands directly -- but by relaying through your service, it's a nice way to mask the true source of their shenanigans.  The problem can get much uglier if your machine has network access to anything not on the public Internet -- say, internal servers behind a firewall, or over a VPN (including roadwarrior VPNs from your laptop).  In that case, with a bit of guesswork, they can possibly do recon or an actual attack against your private infrastructure.
The more control over the e-mail you provide, the more likely this is.  So, if you allow users to set headers, or even worse, control the SMTP conversation itself, the chances of someone working out a way of using your service to do Bad Things goes waaaaaaaay up.
