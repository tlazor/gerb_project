I already had libfaac-dev and libfaac0 installed, and installed faac after the fact to see if that would help.  No dice.
What happens is that when Ubuntu releases a new version of libav, the -extra packages in Medibuntu take a while to be updated. The old -extra packages are not compatible with the new version, and so when you upgrade the -extra packages are removed, thereby removing the non-free codecs.
When using Medibuntu, the core libav packages are still installed from the official Ubuntu repository. Medibuntu adds the -extra packages which provide the non-free functionality.
If you want the full package, you will likely have to build it yourself, or browse Google for an hour, searching for a binary that has the modules you are looking for.
I'm running Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS x64.  I've been using ffmpeg on this machine to encode H.264 videos with AAC audio for over a year.
You could try using the Medibuntu Repository. It is a third-party repository that contains packages that are unable to be included in the official Ubuntu repositories.
Various builds of ffmpeg have certain modules enabled/disabled, often for legal reasons.  (Certain patented codecs and what not can generally not be distributed, except in source form, depending on the country.)
