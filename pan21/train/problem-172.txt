The umask indicates a set of bits, which are not to be set on newly created files and directories. Typical values for umask are 0002, 0007, 0022, 0027, 0077. In your case you want those directories to be writable for the group, which means you want either 0002 which means what is created will be readable to everybody outside the group or 0007 which means what is created is inaccessible to everybody outside the group.
You need to ensure the umask is set at some point before creating new files or directories. The umask is inherited by child processes. Beware of files created outside that specific directory, since the umask is applied elsewhere as well, so anything created elsewhere will still be writable by the group, even if that is a different group from what is used on the /var/www hierarchy.
The setgid bit on a directory indicates that files and directories created inside that directory inherit group from the directory, instead of getting the current group of the user creating it. The setgid bit is inherited by new directories created inside the setgid directory.
The sticky bit is not inherited by subdirectories. There is no need for it to be inherited in order to satisfy its intended purpose. The subdirectories created in a sticky directory are supposed to be off-limits by default for everybody except the creator.
The setgid bit could achieve part of the goal you are trying to achieve. It would achieve the part where the entire hierarchy of directories and files will have the same group (unless explicitly overridden).
It does however not guarantee that everything in there will be writable by the group. That can be achieved through umask setting.
The sticky bit on a directory is used when multiple users are allowed to create files and directories in that directory, but they are only allowed to change those, which they created themselves, they are not allowed to mess with those contents created by other users. The /tmp directory is the typical use case for this.
