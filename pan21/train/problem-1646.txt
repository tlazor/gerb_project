The one in particular I'm after today is the Blog Post tab, which I know I can get to in a round about way via File > New > Blog Post Template. However I don't want a new post, rather an old one, which means File > New > Blog Post Template > Open existing > [select from list] > [close new blog post window] > [slap No I don't to save darn it]. Extra work for nothing is irritating; how do I get Blog Post (or Outlining or ...) to show up in that nice empty space next to AddIns?
Under Word Options > Customize Ribbon > Main Tabs there are several groups checked (Blog Post, Insert (Blog Post), Outlining, Background Removal), but they don't appear on the ribbon even though there is space for them. How is one supposed to turn them on or get to them?
I tried the above methods and they did not work for me... this is what worked for me. go to FILE> OPTIONS> CUSTOMIZE RIBBON> then go to whatever is not showing even though it is checked (mine was the ADD INS TAB, I have a third party program that is activated in this tab) and UNCHECK IT. then close the window. NOW go back to FILE> OPTIONS> CUSTOMIZE RIBBON> and RECHECK YOUR OPTION THAT YOU JUST UNCHECKED, then close the window. it has worked for me several times. Don't know why it keeps doing that to me but this works every time 
File > Options > Add-ins > Manage (at bottom of pop-up window) > Templates > Go. Then I added the new ComplexDocument.dot file that my manager sent and I had saved to my Templates folder. Now I can see the Add-ins tab (plus all the macros I need).
Check to make sure the addins are actually enabled in Word. Go to File > Options > Add-Ins and see if the add ins appear under "Inactive Application Add-Ins". If so click it and then the "Go..." button at the bottom of the page. Then, in the box that pops up, enable the add ins in question.
