On an Oracle Virtualbox host (maybe VM also): disable VirtualBox Host-only Network adapter if you don't need it. 
See this tutorial on how to do this via powershell: http://www.1337admin.org/windows-server/windows-server-2012-r2/change-network-location-using-powershell-in-windows/
I recently experienced this issue where my network would show up as Public rather than Domain, and it was because of NLA kept trying to authenticate on the non-LAN network cards first.
Hopefully this can resolve the issue for others who have multiple NICs, only some of which are used for a LAN connection.
It can also be resolved by restarting the adapter after the machine boots, but that doesn't seem as efficient.
When the SAN1-4 network cards are enabled, Windows identifies the LAN network as a public network and bang - firewall gets in the way.
You can change this on  each interface via PowerShell. Each NIC in the machine receives it's own Index number that you can manually change using PowerShell in  which you can then specify the Type of Network. 
NOTE: the only values defined on the SAN network cards are static IP addresses. No gateway and no DNS. Also, they are on a different subnet. The SAN network is also identified as Unidentified public.
I resolved it by going into my Windows Services and setting the Network Location Awareness service to Automatic (Delayed Start) from Automatic.
When the SAN1-4 network cards are disabled, Windows identifies the LAN network correctly as a domain network on boot.
Adding a Windows 2012 Hyper-V server to the network. The server has five network cards. One is for the LAN and the other four are a private SAN network for MPIO.
