I've read all about AMD's EyeFinity technology that is available on their 6xxx series graphics cards. But I'm clearly missing the thing that makes this technology so incredible and desirable for users.
So it allows me to run multiple (three) monitors on a single graphics card. That's great and all, but why should I care? More specifically, why is EyeFinity superior to multiple, discrete graphics cards? Lots of people seem to heartily recommend it, but I can't figure out why they're recommending EyeFinity rather than simply recommending multiple monitors, something that I'm already quite sold on.
The only thing I can figure out is that it allows people with only one PCI Extreme slot to have multiple monitors. But almost all common motherboards seem to have at least two of these slots. 
I can accomplish the same thing by installing separate graphics cards and plugging a different monitor into each of them. I've done this several times before, including on my current system. With such a configuration, I still have three monitors, but they'll each be powered by their own graphics card, rather than all being powered by the same graphics card. Why should that subtlety matter to me as a user, especially if I'm not a gamer and don't need or want to spend the money on a top-of-the-line card?
I can actually save money buying two lower-end graphics cards and using them to drive 1 or 2 monitors each, rather than buying one EyeFinity card and using it to drive all 3 monitors. If I choose to go that route, what amazing things am I missing out on?
