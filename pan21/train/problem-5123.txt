(Assuming you don't have anything else significant in the computer, a 500W PSU should be sufficient in your specific case. Especially when not under heavy load.)
If swapping the card out does not fix the booting issue, then the problem must lie elsewhere. Some motherboards give error codes using flashing LED patterns on the front panel of the computer or on the motherboard itself. Check to see if it's indicating anything. This should give you some guidance.
If not, then I'd start with the basics. Begin by cleaning out any extraneous dust and verifying that all cables and power connectors are properly hooked up where they should be, including the keyboard (which sometimes can fail a POST). After that, verify that everything is seated properly (any other add-in cards and RAM, first). Then I'd make sure that the PSU is working. Try it in a different computer, or try a different PSU, if possible. Then, start making sure that the processor is seated properly, and that you didn't jolt or damage it somehow. If it's still not working, I'd suspect the motherboard may be at fault.
Take it slow and test each component individual as you replace/reseat/check it. That way you will immediately know what is at fault as you rule things out.
When presented with your situation, the first thing I would try is to remove the graphics card and replace it with another one that you know works, or use integrated graphics (if available). If the PC boots fine, then there was something wrong with the graphics card. Put it back in and try again, making sure that it's seated properly and everything is hooked up as it should be. If it still won't work, then it may be a defective card (not unheard of) and you may need to RMA it.
