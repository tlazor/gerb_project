I would not be surprised at all if there is a better solution that I didn't mention. I look forward to seeing what people suggest. Thank you. 
My question is, how could one create an extending chain whose links are only visible when triggered and when retracted disappear from view? This chain does not need to necessarily interact with physics. I've thought of a couple of ways someone could create an effect like this, but I would rather see if there is a better known solution or implementation of this or a similiar effect before I dive in. Potential solutions could include:
In the Zelda games, there is an item called the hookshot. It is a small mechanical apparatus held in one hand that acts similar to, but not the same as the gun. When it is triggered, the hook at the tip of the item springs forward and an extending chain follows behind it. This chain is spawned when the hookshot is triggered and disappears when the hook is retracted. The chain is not visible beforehand, i.e, it is not spooled around any kind of cylinder and unspooled when shot.There are also other games where characters use grappling apparatus that can be made shorter or longer when a character is hanging from a specific point or pivot. Similarly, this grappling tether is created or hidden as needed to support whether the player wants to shorten or lengthen it.
