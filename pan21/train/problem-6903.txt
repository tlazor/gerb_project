Really interesting idea though, what could be faster than referencing documentation directly is an editor extension that displays possible actions for a resource type while you view your CF template. I have been working on such an extension recently, will paste link here if I complete it.
I suggest directly referencing the docs because a script to generate permissions for a CloudFormation template could produce a list of possible IAM actions for each resource, but at that point you still have to look at the list and say “for this resource (e.g. AutoScalingGroup) what action(s) do I want to take on it?”
You would be better off referencing the IAM docs for the IAM actions required to update a resource. For instance updating a LaunchConfiguration resource’s ImageId property requires the replacement of the LaunchConfiguration resource, and then the AutoScalingGroup must be updated with the new LaunchConfiguration via the UpdateAutoScalingGroup action.
My point being referencing the documentation directly is faster than trial and error and as fast as the tool proposed.
