I'm looking for the data-code, in this case 531 = not permitted to logon at this workstation as found by the JIRA LDAP Error Code Documentation.
DEC: 1907 - ERROR_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE (The user's password must be changed before logging on the first time.) 
The DEC: values are not presented in Portal logs; however, review of LDAP activity combined with analysis of SystemOut.log and relevant configuration tasks can help narrow down the root cause.
DEC: 1329 - ERROR_INVALID_WORKSTATION (Logon failure: user not allowed to log on to this computer.) 
Although it's kind of branded around Exchange, it provides error codes for Windows, SQL, Exchange, etc., etc.
NOTE: Returns when username is valid but password/credential is invalid. Will prevent most other errors from being displayed as noted. 
There are also online implementations of it (such as http://errlookup.azurewebsites.net) in case you don't want to download the utility, or you want to do a lookup on a non-Windows device.

Microsoft makes a program named err.exe that you can download and use to look up error codes.  More officially named the Microsoft Exchange Server Error Code Look-up tool:
DEC: 1909 - ERROR_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT (The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.) 
Specifically given LDAP: error code 49 - 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C0903A9, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 531, v1db1
