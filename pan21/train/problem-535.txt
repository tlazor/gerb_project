Ensure that the Windows 10 client that is failing is on Win 10 build 1803 and TSpkg.dll in %Windir%\System32 is at File version 10.0.17134.48.
By the way, all these servers, including the one I cannot log into, as well as all the clients trying to connect are behind a firewall. 
I have read this advisory mentioned in the error I get when my client tries to log into our server. 
You may be, but this server may not. There is a compatibility matrix which works with which and the registry setting you can use to modify you servers behaviour.
If these are not true then you are incorrect about having all relevant updates installed.  Review the update links mentioned in MS KB 4295591
It is a CredSSP error trying to log into a Windows 2012 Server R2 that Win 8 and Win 7 clients can log into. Another Win 10 client can also log into the same server.
The problem seems like there is a setting on my workstation that needs to change, but I cannot tell what to set. 
You can try to set the AllowEncryptionOracle DWORD in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters to "2".
I would appreciate any advice on what to check. Also, I am fully updated with Microsoft Windows updates.
