The closest I can suggest to an answer is: I think there are many interesting questions in computability theory that might depend on the machine model.  For example: is the Busy Beaver function, with its usual definition in terms of Turing machines, infinitely often odd?  Is the value of BB(20) independent of ZFC?  Whatever the answers to these questions are, they could surely be different for relativized analogues of the BB function.
If by "results in computability theory," you mean results that are invariant with respect to the choice of machine model (Turing machines, RAM machines, etc.), then I don't know a single example of such a result, and I definitely would've remembered if I'd seen one.
Here's a more or less trivial example:  Consider the halting problem for Turing machines that are specifically prohibited (by the definition of the computation model) from accessing an oracle.  It is undecidable relative both to no oracle and to a trivial oracle, and yet it is decidable relative to an oracle for the halting problem.  (The problem itself doesn't change relative to an oracle because it can't access the oracle, but the (unrestricted) TM that decides the problem becomes more powerful given the oracle.)
There are plenty of other examples, too.  Just play with the computation model a little and you can find other similar results.
