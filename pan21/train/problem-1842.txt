I am using Raspberry Pi for the first time. I did the conventional setup that most people mentioned. This includes
I am not sure what the error could be. Something interesting I noticed is that the ssh file keeps disappearing after I boot up the raspberry pi. Is this normal?
Here the tutorial https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget.pdf
You may wanna read this Raspberry Pi Zero W Headless setup â€“ Windows 10 RNDIS Driver issue resolved tutorial and pay attention in the section on RNDIS Driver from MOD (Musical Operating Devices). Most Rpi0/W installation on a Windows OS 9particularly v10) runs into some sort of problem and can be simply resolved with the RNDIS Driver from MOD (Musical Operating Devices). I hope this helps.
I also had other issues that made it difficult to find the raspberry pi's ip address (which I would rather ssh to) and may have contributed to the connectivity issues. This includes that ipconfig shows that the port which the raspberry pi is connected to is disconnected 
The result is the error that the connection does not exist. I tried pinging from cmd but I got the same result. 
It just worked after one point. I cannot remember what exactly changed but looking back the post my assumption is that I stupidly tried to ssh into raspberry.local not raspberrypi.local.
