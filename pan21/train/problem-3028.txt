here are some newer/other references/angles on this apparently deep question with ongoing research. as indicated by P.Shor the area so far seems to be waiting on a comprehensive survey, standardization, and and/or unification. there are more abstract/theoretical approaches listed 1st, followed by more applied approaches: energy efficient algorithms, measurement of energy use in mobile for sorting, study of factors in VLSI affecting energy/time complexity.
p.s gabgoh's point about Landauer's principle is a good one. If you want to learn more about the relation between energy and information, there's no better source than the Maxwell's Demon book.
This isn't a direct answer at all, but are some potentially useful connections to draw/research programmes to be conducted along the lines of Stay and Baez' work on algorithmic thermodynamics: http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/algorithmic-thermodynamics/
Time and space complexities are device independent. I don't see a way to make energy-complexity device independent.
If $W$ is work done by a Turing machine to perform one basic step. Then energy complexity becomes number of steps times $W$. $W$ is highly machine dependent. 
There aren't energy complexity classes yet, but there there's definitely a lot of interest in studying how to design algorithms that are energy efficient under some model. I'm not familiar with the entire body of work, but one entry point is the work that Kirk Pruhs is doing on sustainable computing. Kirk is a theoretician with expertise in scheduling and approximations, and has recently become very active in this area, so his perspective is a good one for algorithmic folks. 
Do take note, however, that this work does not draw out actual physical consequences -- rather it illustrates a connection that is, thus far, purely mathematical.
