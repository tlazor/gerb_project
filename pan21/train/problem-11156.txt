As far as the LCD goes, Adafruit has a great LCD that does require some soldering, but will allow you to put out the IP address of the Pi at boot.  The tutorials associated with the LCD on the Adafruit learning pages walk through configuration.  I use one for a wifi radio and once it boots to the login prompt (if you're watching a monitor) it displays the IP for a few seconds on the LCD, the same time it writes it to the console on the monitor (look right above the login prompt).
The other option is to statically assign an IP to the Pi and then assign an IP to a laptop/desktop in the same subnet and use either a crossover cable or a small switch, assuming you are using the ethernet.
 Most hardware nowadays will auto neggotiate, so if using a cable, you dont need a special one, like a crosscable in the old days.
If you have a laptop, you could use that as dhcp server, (very easy to setup using Ubuntu, explanation will follow.  Even using Ubuntu Live CD or usbstick.) in that case the laptop must have an ethernet/wifi connection just as the Pi.
Another more complex option would be to set the Pi up as an access point using a wifi dongle.  The performance of this along side the Raspbian OS and other processes may drop but it would allow remote access, and fewer cables.
