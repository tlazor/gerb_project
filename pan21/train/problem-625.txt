It seems one can include headers, along the lines of  Cancel-Lock or Cancel-Key , to prevent others from cancelling your posts.  I've seen the same trolls do it probably to prevent their posts being cancelled.
"DataBasix propagates but does not honor cancels. DataBasix users may not cancel  posts made by another with the exception of posts forged in userâ€™s valid address."
(as far as they are concerned.. people can always killfile a user.. and like many liberal usenet providers, they don't allow the troll to morph-   eg change name, to avoid a killfile)..   So they're not malicious usenet providers exactly.. Altopia is another one like databasix.  And if a troll is reported to have violated their TOS, they are meant to be dealt with..
