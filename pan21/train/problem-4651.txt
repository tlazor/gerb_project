I did this once and I was testing something and added a entry to the hosts file so sometime later everytime I pinged via ip the router it would show up this strange host name..  took me awhile to remember that I had edited the hosts file!
If you're having trouble locating the router, the 192.168.8.1 router will have the MAC address of the router. You can use a MAC lookup to get the vendor of the device. Your switches (if managed) will know what port number the device is plugged into as well (find it by the MAC address again).
Check the reverse DNS pointer entry for 192.168.10.5, it's probably point to that PC's hostname. Doesn't mean packets are going to that PC, just that reverse DNS is wrong.
Many routers are firewalled to not respond to direct requests from outside their subnet. So if you're on the 192.168.8.x subnet, and it's on the 192.168.10.x subnet, it probably will not respond to your requests (even just to ping it).
Check the routing table on 192.168.8.1, and the table on it's default router. So if 192.168.8.1 is configured with a default route of 192.168.n.m, go to that router and check it's table for the 192.168.10.5 entry (this is probably the case).
If you say "Yes" to Point #4 - my immediate reaction will be to try to set up a packet sniffer such as Ethereal/Wireshark to spot for anomalies in all incoming/outgoing packets from the affected terminal.
It's not impossible that the device has been sending ICMP redirects for a variety of IP addresses, pointing to itself instead of to whatever the next-hop SHOULD be.
First thing I would do is to ping 192.168.10.5 from 192.168.8.1 (the main switch). After that, it should be visible in the switch's ARP table (to get it under IOS, you'd simply type sh arp | i 192.168.10.5). That should then allow you to find the manufacturer of the network card (This URL is a good starting point) and also let you find what the outbound switch-port is for that MAC (again, under IOS, sh mac-address address MACgoesHERE) and that should give you enough info to proceed.
