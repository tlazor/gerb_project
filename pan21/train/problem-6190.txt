I got a subsequent e-mail from sonic.net's tech support (impressive, especially since I'm not even a customer of theirs) and they said that "the odd IP entries I was seeing smoothing into a more normal setup."
I could delete the A record and see if my problems return to confirm or deny #1.  The reason I'm suspicious about it is because I never had an A record with my old mail provider either, and yet could send mail to sonic.net.  However, since it's working now, I'm reluctant to touch it.
I've since sent test messages, got no bounces, and gotten replies.  So it seems mail to sonic.net is working.  So the cause was one of 3 things:
Due to abuse, most of Google Apps and Amazon ECS is also blocked at our border since it is a haven for poorly written web bots that don't have the first clue about distributed computing.
We reject almost all Google Apps and Amazon ECS servers for email due to the amount of spam that both kick out.  Both are listed on numerous blacklists as a result.  
Maybe sonic.net is doing a reverse DNS lookup and checking to see if that user exists on the sender's mail server (*.googlemail.com), which returns false.
