My question: Is there a way to listen/accept all ip addresses for a specific port? It would basically be a *:8080 entry so that I can have all external computers access my TFS.
In order to do this, i had to go into netsh and make it so IIS only listens to 127.0.0.1. The problem is that I have Team Foundation Server on IIS on port 8080 and would like to be able to remotely access it. This means that I need to be able to have IIS listen for all IP addresses on only port 8080.
The optimal solution would be if I can have IIS listen to all IP addresses period EXCEPT 127.0.0.2. Is there some exclusion list?
IIS listen on all interfaces by default. Any interface that is already taken will not be listened on.
I'm running both IIS and Apache. I have Apache set to 127.0.0.2 and IIS to 127.0.0.1 so that I can have them both on port 80.
Just make sure Apache starts before IIS and you should be set. Are you actually using port 8080 in apache as well?
If push comes to shove, I'll just ask all members who will access my TFS for their address and I can enter them in manually.
