I use the English and German spell-checking feature a lot and I find the spell-checking works to my satisfaction.
You can follow this guide to integrate openoffice and thunderbird dictionaries: http://hektor.umcs.lublin.pl/~mikosmul/computing/tips/mozilla-thunderbird.html
I don't know your text editor, but if it supports myspell dictionaries the procedure is very similar.
So, is it possible to use my Mozilla dictionaries in my text editor (feel free to propose one that supports that)?
I also write text using various flavors of text editors on windows. It would be great to use the same dictionary in my local editor as I use with my Mozilla apps, as that would reduce a lot of duplicated dictionary maintenance (adding the same word 3 times over) and I also found the Mozilla dictionary to work slightly better than then one in my texteditor. (I use PSPad atm. for simple text files / TeXnicCenter for LaTeX editing.)
The spell checking in PSPad sucks for German as it is case-insensitive. I recommend using the free Notepad++. It comes with a plugin called DSpellCheck that supports Hunspell. With the symlink method mentioned before, you should be able to use one set of dictionary files for pretty much every writing task.
