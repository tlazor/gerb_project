Just glancing over the other replies I saw Evan's "Perhaps my head is stuck firmly in the sand (or someplace worse!) but I haven't seen any compelling business reasons, as of yet, to move any of my Customers over to IPv6." That is how I see it, and how I've seen it ever since the great "we're running out of IP addresses" issue was first raised. To me it's not too unlike the '85 "energy crisis".
Should the need (real need, not just an imagined one) to run IPv6 arise during my working life I'm not at all concerned because anything I work with that could conceivable need to deal directly with IPv6 can already do so. Other than email the only thing we have that needs to talk directly to other IPv6 systems is the firewall. The web sites are hosted by a third party, so that's their problem and I'm comfortable with their ability to support IPv6. Internally nothing needs IPv6. I don't need the extra hassle of supporting an unnecessary layer and the company doesn't need the cost of replacing those items that can't deal with it when there is absolutely no reason to do so. Let's face it, nobody's internal network is so large that IPv4 can't cope and the Internet facing devices shouldn't be in the internal network.
