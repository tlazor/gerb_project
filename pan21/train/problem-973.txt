Whenever she is on the computer, my internet speed drops to practically zero. I can't do anything at all.
I know nothing from a technical IT perspective. But I am sitting on an Apple iMac retina with a wifi connection. 
Problem is that your seeding creates a lot of connections to other down-loaders, therefore PING increases a lot. If you have to play FPS games, 50-100 ms can hurt much.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't take precautions against bandwidth overconsumption. I don't know how much bandwidth you have available and what your download cap is, but as Nolonar mentioned, make sure you have your torrent setup properly.
Even when she uses another wifi computer, she's definitely getting more things done. So from experience, something is going on and the bandwidth is most definitely not being shared equally between these two computers. :(
In the adjoining room, my sister has an ancient computer running Windows XP with a LAN cable, right next to the modem/router. 
I don't know what all that is about, but I am so frustrated by not being able to do real work while she is running nothing more than facebook, well I am inclined to adjust the QoS settings on her computer to see if that makes a difference.
It will affect the bandwidth your brother has available. However, online games are not THAT bandwidth intensive. To give an example: I play several MMOs, and on one of them, playing with a group of 24 other players takes less than 10 Kbps during the most intensive moments. Most other games are in that same ballpark.
