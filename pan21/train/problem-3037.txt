I need to install on several of our old WindowsXp workstations (only 1GB of RAM, 40GB for harddrive!) a Unix server for allowing our developers to perform some preliminary test on Unix.
I never managed to make kmap works on a XVesa session: typing "tinycore kmap=azerty/fr-latin" or adding "loadkmap < /usr/share/kmap/azerty/fr-latin9.kmap" to the /opt/bootlocal.sh (and then restarting while backing up my config) was enough to get an azerty keyboard... 
Considering the different Linux distros, I decided to go with the fairly recent and very small TinyCore distribution (3.7).
Considering the change of keyboard in * instantaneous* (as opposed to the loadkmap), this seems to be a better method.
See "Frugal Installation of TinyCore", using the virtual disk of the VirtualBox "TinyCore" session, based on cfdisk and grub.
When TinyCore is installed on hda1, the next reboot will still use the CD first, but you can launch the right TinyCore by typing at the "boot>" prompt
Once a first TinyCore session is opened (a "live" one from the CD iso), the installation on hda1 can proceed, but with the default keyboard (us).
