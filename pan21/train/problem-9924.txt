Upon discovering that QTCreator did not come with a compiler, I immediately lost myself to Youtube and found a way to install the compiler G++. Worked.
Another thing. Do I need the compiler at all? Or does QTCreator save C++ files with the apt-get install libstdc++6-4.6-de
apt-get and is a front-end to install dpkg-files. You will use them to install your tools. You don't need to build your own dpkg-files to create a application. Compiling your C++ program is enough to create a working application.
Synaptic is a graphical tool. It should make it easier for you to manage and search packages on Raspbian where plain apt is too confusing.
Now here comes the problem. When adding a compiler to be used by QTCreator, it required me to enter the file path of the compiler I wanted to link. Thing is, how do you like a file that was installed with sudo apt-get? Last time I checked, any files installed with sudo apt-get don't appear in your desktop. So what is the file path for the compiler file installed with apt-get?
The downside is that you now have that much more stuff in front of you to learn and might have trouble keep focused to get anything done.
Generally speaking you don't need a IDE to write a program. To write a C++ program a good text-editor and the compiler itself will do. 
QT-Creator is your integrated development environment (IDE). It integrates access to all kind of usfull tools, makes it easy to get a good overview of your project and switch from one tool to another easily.
