If your git process exceeds the limits, the kernel will kill the process despite the max memory reported being available on your system.
What platform/distribution are you on? Ubuntu, redhat, centos, etc... Both for the client and server? What's the memory usage on the client you're pushing from? I've had this happen before with pushes which encompass a large # of revisions. I know one workaround is to incrementally push your changes to the server if at all possible. The other solution is to increase your kernel memory usage. With some kernel distributions, there are setting which prevent the kernel from allocation max memory to a single process:
Note: be careful with these settings. You probably don't want to use the settings in that example as i pulled them from a server in our environment.
This overrides a couple of parameters that limit the number of bytes mapped from files. These are the defaults used for a 32-bit system, the 64-bit defaults are much larger.  I'm speculating you are using a 64-bit system, which is causing git to use very large defaults, but there are resource constraints (perhaps from running in a VM) that trigger the error.
