There is no file /.monit_is_running so this alert will always trigger about once a day.  This is a heartbeat for monit itself, so I know that it's running (a sort of "who watches the watchers" thing).  This is an idea I got from someone on Serverfault, actually, but I don't remember who off-hand.
Since you have Postfix in there, you should consider how Monit alerts are actually going to get off the box in case Postfix is down.  In my case, I'm doing a set mailserver gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com and sending the mail to a gmail account, so that I'm not relying on the functionality of my own mail server to get alert email out to me.  I also have a gmail filter that will forward the alert message to an SMS gateway, so I get a text.
Depending on what's being served by Apache, you can test on a request (e.g., request "/monit_token") instead of a plain HTTP response.  The request can be something that hits your app directly, rather than just a static file.  Again, it depends on what you're doing.
