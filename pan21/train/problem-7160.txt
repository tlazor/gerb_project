But I have no idea (and haven't found much information on the internet) how I can get my web server to actually use these ciphers. 
I can certainly fix this by altering the software on the client and replace the https URL with a HTTP one, removing all the HTTPS stuff from the connection. 
Could using one of the SSL ciphers without authentication (for example, TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL or TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA possibly make this device accept my fake connection? Maybe it accepts these fake ciphers ...
In theory, if the device accepts these ciphers, that should work with the fake server since these ciphers don't authenticate the server, do they?
I'm currently using Apache and tried configuring these ciphers, but it didn't work and the documentation states that the null ciphers have been removed because they are insecure. However, I know that they are insecure and would like to use them anyways ...
Is there another web server which I could use to negotiate a null cipher with that client and hopefully make it connect to my server even though it has no valid cert?
I have an old device that connects to a HTTPS web page and downloads some content. I want that device to download content from a domain I control, but the client has a specific Root CA embedded and only connects if the SSL connection uses a certificate by this CA. 
However I'm searching for a way to make that work without modification of the client (only DNS edits) and now I've read from the "SSL null ciphers".
