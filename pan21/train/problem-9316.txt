I've had the same problem several times and haven't found a way to specify a default color that would be used when a texture is not used.
I've ended up creating 1x1 pixel fully white, black and transparent textures that are globally available. This does the job pretty well and is easy to use, although I don't like the unnecessary texture accesses in the shader.
Ideally, I don't want to have an extra uniform for each mesh specifying whether or not the texture should be used.
The way I imagine it, I would just pass a flat "grey" as the specular map, for instance, and the shader could just act as if a texture was passed in. Is this possible?
I'd like to, without making the shader code too complicated, be able to specify a constant color instead of a texture, for the normal or specular maps. This is for example if a given mesh doesn't need one of those maps.
So I have the following situation: I'm sharing a blinn shader accross many meshes. Some meshes have specular & normal maps, others do not.
Another alternative would be to actually create a grey texture on the fly, if this is the better way, please advise on the simplest way to do this.
