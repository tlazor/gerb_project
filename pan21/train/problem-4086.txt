The tool can be configured per key, e.g. by copy/pasting symbols once from a site such as http://copypastecharacter.com. It comes preconfigured with various symbols.
I was typing in Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan) in its default input method (Microsoft Bopomofo) and discovered this (tested on XP and Win10):
I will shamelessly plug a little tool I wrote for entering symbols in Windows as I find any solution usually presented too cumbersome for daily frequent use. My personal use case is typing the Swedish Ã¥ for example on an international US keyboard without having to switch layouts. 
John D. Cook's solutions didn't work for me, as my employer has locked down the registry. I discovered that in Windows 7 and above, the Segoe UI Symbol font contains representations of most if not all of the Unicode characters in numeric order.  If you can find a Unicode symbol meeting your needs (perhaps by browsing through the Unicode article in Wikipedia), note its Unicode number (hex value). Then, back in Word, choose Insert Symbol | More Symbols from the ribbon, select the Segoe UI Symbol font, and scroll through the screens looking for that hex value in the character code box. 
See https://github.com/mjvh80/SymWin for details, it's free and open source, but must (currently) be built, if there is sufficient interest I could add a pre-built version.
Alas, this appears to require a registry setting. It is usually set but if needed, under HKEY_Current_User/Control Panel/Input Method, set EnableHexNumpad to "1". If you have to add it, set the type to be REG_SZ.
It allows the entering of unicode characters through a popup window not dissimilar to how this works in Apple OS X.
