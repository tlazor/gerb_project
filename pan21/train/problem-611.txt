For anyone looking for an program that will create the IPSEC policy, filters, etc and automatically scan the event log and add IP's to the block list, I've written a small program that does just that.
I had this problem too where my event log would be filled with thousands of entries for hackers attempting to login to my MSSQL instance with the 'sa' login.  After much searching, I decided to write my own program, have it create the neccessary IPSEC items, and then scan the event log every 60 seconds for attacks from new IP addresses.  It then adds the IP address to the IPSEC filter, and blocks all traffic to and from the IP.  I have only tested this on Windows Server 2008, but believe it will work on other versions as well.
Please note that this only works for SQL login attempts using the 'sa' login, but I could modify it to work for other log events as well.  Also, you can view the IP's that have been blocked, but you will continue to see some items in the event log since the program only runs every 60 seconds.  This is due to not being able to delete a single event log entry, and I didn't think deleting the entire log would be a good idea.
