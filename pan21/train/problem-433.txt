If you have already done reseating and If it's then found, run a full diagnostic (F12 at powerup). But if it's not found or detected by the computer after reseat then its busted.
You can press F2 at startup and check if your hard drive is detected or not. If yes then try to mount it externally. If if still undetectable then you would need a new hard drive (The drive will be replaced under warranty - but data recovery is at your expense.  The warranty does not cover that.)
Reseat the drive means - Removing and then reinstall. You need to unplug the cables and remove it completely and then re connect it again so its detectable, Or you can seek help from a repair shop.
Try taking your drive out and putting it back in again. Ensure the connectors are in firmly. If it still can't physically find it the drive might have failed.
Hit F12 and check if your boot legacy option is OFF, if it is ON change it to OFF then system asks your permission say okay problem solves..
If you CAN see the drive but not boot from it, remove it, Mount it in a 2.5" external drive case and attach it to a working system to see what you can recover yourself.  Note:  this will ONLY work if the system can see the drive.  If it cannot, you will need a data recovery service. 
This error can occur if the laptop was bumped hard enough to dislodge the drive connection internally. Often removing and reinserting the drive can solve the issue.
