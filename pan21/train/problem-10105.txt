Having a good understanding will strengthen your foundations so when tides, such as Deep Learning, come towards you, you will know how to keep your stand and make the most of it. You will understand how tides come and go and allow them to transform you instead of overwhelming you.
Another recommendation is Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning. Although not as deep, it is full of practical advice for different methods.
As mentioned before, you need to slowly pave your way through different topics, from practical decisions about datasets, computer, training time, to deeper decisions about the model and overall approach.
My recommendation as someone trying to go through the same path is to look for great leaders in the area and go through their courses thoroughly. The first one I can recommend is David MacKay, with his free book (http://www.inference.org.uk/itila/book.html and lectures (http://videolectures.net/david_mackay/). David's approach to Machine Learning is that of a "connector", trying to show connections between different fields. Take a look at his lectures and try to follow them with exercises on the book. This will give you a solid foundation on which to draw upon when you are in trouble. He saved me more than once.
