inset '0.5f / texture_width' from the left and right side of the texture and '0.5f / texture_height' from top and bottom. You're seeing sampling artefacts - texture samplers usually sample from the centre of texels so on the left and right, top and bottom (at 0 and 1 uv) you're getting 50% of whatever texel your sampler gets when it's out of bounds. That's either the other side of the texture or a default sampling colour.
My best guess is that the difference between MAC and iPhone is caused by antialiasing on the MAC. My 3D programming is a bit rusty, but I guess you would have to make all the squares part of the same mesh or something like that.
Are the six textures set up, specifically, as a cube map or are each of the skybox faces rendered separately with their own texture?  I heard some early PC systems had rather poor filtering when it came to handling cubemaps in that they didn't necessarily filter across the from one face texture to the next when you sampled near the cube edges. AFAIK the SGX (iphone GPU) should filter across edges correctly.
Dirty hack solution would be to make all the squares a bit too big so they overlap and clip each other and adjust UV coordinates accordingly.
It did occur to me that the bottom of your side textures looks to be a similar shade of blue to the artefact . Could you try, say, making the bottom row (or a few rows) of pixels a hideous shade of magenta and see if that changes the artefact colour? That might give some more idea of what may or may not be happening.
