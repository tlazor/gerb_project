This doesn't look straight forward so some sort of explanation is necessary, but the you can get the idea about the difference in values.
The best you can do is plot the values, then in another plot, show either the differences or the ratios between the values. (Using a secondary axis shows these things, but not as clearly as separate charts).
The problem is that your maximum difference is less than 1% of the vertical axis scale, so you can't exaggerate the differences without distorting the underlying values.
The horizontal axis (x-axis) has four points 1,2,3, and 4. I've two sets of observations (data series) each for the four points in X-axis. I want to compare how the data series vary for each point on x-axis. The difference is in fraction and a line-graph is nearly superimposing one series with another. Modifying the major and minor units is of no help. Can anyone suggests how to plot them in MS excel (2010-2016) so that the difference between the data series for each x-axis point is visible. Put another way how to make the lines not to superimpose each other.
The default Major and Minor units are: 20 and 4 for the above line-chart. If I edit them to be 0.10 and 0.01 respectively, the spacing between the lines remains the same (i.e. still overlapping)
