With these systems you get more than just file storage. You get version control (can go back to last version), security so you can control access, custom metadata and searching on metadata, full content search of the documents, can tie approval processes to documents, can scan documents in the web interface into the system, can get notifications when documents are viewed or modified. 
At my organization, we are loading up an instance of (DocMgr).  It's free, runs against Postgresql, keeps revisions of documents, OCR, indexing, relevance searching.  It can easily be tweaked to run against MySQL.  The project has been stagnant for a while, but development is picking back up.
You could quite easily setup samba on your linux file server and share the directories that way. It would allow you to mount the shares, control permissioning, and not drastically change the way you are currently setup.
Here is a link to the current official how to guide to setup Samba: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/
The only caveat is that it would have issues if these are files that more than one person edits often. If a file gets edited simultaneously on two computers, you will end up with two versions. 
Basically it would let each user set up a shared folder on their computer and automatically sync files when they are changed. Works great and they have versions for Windows and Mac. I have used it for years and love the functionality.
I might be able to point you in the right direction a bit better if I was aware of what distribution you use.
You may want to consider a real Document Management system. These days there are hosted web-based ones available such as DocuVantage which are very cheap and take no time to setup.
