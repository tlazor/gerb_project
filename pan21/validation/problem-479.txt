Now when the company grows again, all I have to do is clone the AP configuration, set up the device's IP and add it to the huntgroups on the Gateway, and the network has been extended. What's more, I have full overview over network stats, website visits, bandwidth usage, packet classification and more.
A little bit more information would be helpful like are there multiple locations?  Are they VPN'd?  WAN'd?  If each location has a seperate public access, then theres really no way around accomplishing anything that doesn't require going to each site. 
But, if you have some extra Windows Server boxes (a Linux box would also work if your so inclined), you can always setup an RAS as you gateway and do some throttling that way.  I think it even plays into group policy.  As for content filtering, you can always use a proxy (either setup through your router or individual machines) that are setup to block inappropriate/non-work related sites.  Theres free and paid sites, but you usually get what you pay for.  Let us know a little more about your setup. ;)
