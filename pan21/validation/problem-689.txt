Reading on the net and following tutorials is fine, but I found over the years that user groups can also sometime be very useful. Exchange of information, and working with peers is sometime the best way to get your hands dirty about Linux. 
you cannot learn linux by simply following a tutorial,you have to get you hands dirty and deal with the system itself,try new distros,solve problems,........etc
And I also think that the best way to learn Linux is to actually start using it. With today's virtual machines, it is easy to get Linux installed in a way that will not cause troubles to your existing installation. Same for the live versions, such as Ubuntu. You can start everything from the CD, and even install it on a USB memory stick, so you can start from it, have your own setup and config, then with a single reboot get back to your existing comfort zone, in the the OS you use to do your work. Once you're comfortable enough with Linux, you can then make the jump and get it installed on your own hard disk. But by then, you will have gained experience.
Here are some links to Linux tutorial sites. To learn more you of  will need tutorials on the type of Linux you want to use. This might or might not be what you want:
One of my personal favorites is "Unix for the Impatient" which is great to understand the essence of Unix.  There is much more on top of that, but this is a good starting point.
