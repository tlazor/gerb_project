Magic SysReq as mentioned in the other answers, is really all you have. If you only have SSH access you can trigger SysReq like so:
On a related note, if you have a remote system with rocketing load and you need to kill it dead you can use this to force a reboot without cleanly shutting down:
See man killall to see how you might tailor it your needs. In general you might want to run process with ulimit to keep them under control, and monitor memory usage with something like Nagios (See the gazillion 'What monitoring for ...' questions for alternatives).
Can you think of a command that holds all processes whatsoever, thus (and while) allowing you to open a clean shell where you can examine the source of the problem and kill the process which ate up all the memory? (I guess this won't be easy, because as the memory is probably completely filled up you'd need to swap out some more memory to gather space for opening a shell, on the other hand all other swapping processes must be stopped.)
When Linux starts swapping you're basically doomed. Very soon the system won't react to any input any more, but happily swap on until the end of days...
If you tied such a command to a hot key then maybe you can use this as an emergency button saving you a lot a time. Any ideas if this is possible at all? Has somebody tried something like this before? If one could realize this it would be a cool feature :)
Making an executable script out of this and executing this as soon a you notice the swapping might give you a chance. Disabling swap is an option too if you have sufficient memory to handle temporary memory spikes, or if you are OK with killing random programs when you run out of memory.
