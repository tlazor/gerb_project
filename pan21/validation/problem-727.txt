All the clients and the server are 1Gb cable connected to Cisco SG-200 switch, no extra settings there. Only IPv4 is used, DNS and DHCP provided by Windows. Browsing on web on "slow" computers run on full speed as well, only shared drives and some applications from our server (photo map tiles) run slow.
we run homogenous network based on Windows SBS (2008R2) server and W7 as clients. Today, the network start to act weird. From some of the computers (it seems that only from those who have been turned off during weekend) the speed of download from server shared drive is ridiculous, some 100-200kb/s on 1Gb network. From other computers the speed is just fine. What makes me crazy is the fact, that when I connect from the "slow" computer to the server via Remote desktop, and I simply COPY-PASTE the very same files to local computer, it runs with full speed (it means the physical connection between server and client is just fine and able to run on full speed, there is just some difference between copying from shared folder and via remote desktop) ! Ping behaves normally, all below 1ms, no timeouts, no lost packets. 
I have an issue like this, the resource availability of my server was consummed by kaspersky reviewing every file on NAS/File system, after that all client previously authenticathed not lose access or performance to shared, but new clients without previous connection not able to view, transfer and the performance to connect to NAS File server was pooor.
So, please review the connections, close the old connections, stop process using/examining files and test it with a recent power on computer.
Maybe you will need reboot the File Resource Service to acomplish this performance recovered to 100%.
I tried all I can, reseting network settings, setting various duplex mode on network cards, copy-paste various files, restarting services on server, disable and even uninstall antivirus, firewall, monitor on server and on client, that the network is not utilised (both run below 1%), the disks are not utilised (same ), CPU is just fine, so there are no visible problems on both sides, and as I mentioned, there are computers which can access the server with full speed, without anything being different. 
So reviewing with the cmd "Net sessions", this list all active sessions consumed by file share access, multiple of that was made a month ago, plus Kaspersky reviewing and Search Indexer process duplicate the job of every read/write file the performance was degraded to 10%.
