The first of these accepts all traffic on the loopback interface.  This is one of the ways the kernel talks to itself, and it's fairly important not to block this traffic; unpredictable results can occur if you do.  It is a standard rule and I'm not aware of any security implications to using it.
I'm afraid I have to agree with Iain; if you want to start customising your iptables rules you need to learn quite a bit more about TCP/IP before doing so.
This is my IPtable rules for my webserver with SSH installed, i've had help to get this far. My question is, are my rules contradictory. For example, I've been recommended to use these two lines:
The second is a little more complex.  There are a number of types of ICMP that you want to permit, either for informational (eg ICMP-host-unreachable) or functional (eg ICMP-fragmentation-needed, ICMP-echo-reply) purposes.  But there are others, such as ICMP-echo-request, that you may not want to permit.  There is no easy way to advise you on what you should do, but some might argue that
A likely reason for adding such rules at the top of your INPUT chain is to accept the packages early, so that they won't have to traverse all your rules:
That all said, I note you list the loopback rule twice, which is completely pointless, and you are filtering OUTPUT traffic and permitting no return-half packets to the permitted INPUT traffic.  So that's not going to work at all well.
