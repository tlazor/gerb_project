AVG anti virus is free (for home use) and regularly gets very high marks in tests, even against commercial products. 
Note that I generally disable any "real time" scanning or other crap that slows the machine down, but I scan anything I download from an untrusted source.
We're using ClamWin on our Vista and Windows 7 machines at work, since our corporate antivirus doesn't support either of those operating systems (WTF!).  It's free and works well; I've also got the Mac version installed on my laptop to scan and Office docs I get before opening them.
MSE is fine for a home user but SEP offers more functionality and fine tuning.  SEP is generally more business oriented.  As such, once its subscription expires, you are out of luck and exposed.  MSE is free.  I have access to SEP and MSE on my Win 7 machine and chose MSE, mostly due to its small footprint.
MS security essentials is the best free anti-virus around, but detections rates for paid apps change daily so we never are quite sure who has the best paid. i, personally, never trust Symantec, but if it isn't slowing your computer, multiple antiviruses are usually good. the only time i have problem with protection programs is firewalls, you only want one of those.
