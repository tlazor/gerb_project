From what I've seen some have solved this by disabling Hyper-V but I can't find that on my computer. https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_compatibility says you need an upgraded version of Windows 10 to be able to use Hyper-V, which they say you need for running virtual machines. (yet I've read that the 64-bit option becomes available if you disable Hyper-V). Do I actually need to upgrade Windows 10 to run a VM?
Hyper-V, being a Type-1 hypervisor (bare metal), runs your entire system inside a virtual machine, denying VirtualBox (Type-2 hypervisor) access to hardware virtualization.
Hyper-V, shipping with Pro editions of Windows, is likely to be enabled under various circumstances (like having the advanced Visual Studio Android emulator installed).
There is yet another thing that could interfere: Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM), another way to emulate Android faster. It comes as a driver for Windows. It takes exclusive control of hardware virtualization when installed, even when no VM is running.
However, having it active may not be enough. When already inside a virtual machine, access to hardware virtualization is not possible in most cases, because it is reserved by the hypervisor. Even with nested virtualization enabled, compatibility is very limited.
In short you have to use the command listed at the second link from an elevated cmd prompt, reboot the system and disable the "device guard", after that VirtualBox will start back working as expected and offering x64 guest support
Had the same issue lately; I have a Windows 10 system running with the "insider preview" option (OS version Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Build 17025.rs_prerelease.171020-1626), the system was happily running VirtualBox 5.2.6 and offering 64 bits VM support, then, days ago, Windows Update offered an OS upgrade, I went on and installed it (new OS version Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Build 17074.rs_prerelease_flt.180116.1539) and suddenly VirtualBox didn't show the 64 bits guest options; after fiddling for a while I decided to rollback the upgrade to check if it was responsible for the issue, and it was !
What VirtualBox wants is hardware-assisted virtualization. Intel calls it “VT-x”, AMD’s counterpart is named “AMD-V” (previously: “SVM”). So for this to work at all, your CPU needs to support hardware-assisted virtualization and it has to be enabled in the firmware setup.
