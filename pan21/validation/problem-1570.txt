Indeed, there is a solution now, and I did not have try and make it. I tested it, and it works exactly as needed, by copying the text into the note contents.
How can I modify the highlight tool to automatically copy the highlighted text into the resulting comment bubble?
Then instead of the original repository you download jsqliu's "edit" branch. That is, run the following commands in terminal (should give no fatal erros, though it will give some warnings). If you don't want to install git, then downloading the zip repository from https://github.com/jsqliu/okular/tree/edit will also work.
Then just run Okular. Whenever you highlight text, it will copy the contents into the note. I've no idea, when or if it will become an Okular standard, but jsqliu's edit works perfectly and does the job.
Let me know, if this is not enough, and you can't get it to work. I may be able to provide more info. I've also started to use Docear recently, and this feature makes a huge difference!
Since I'm a bit computer-distant myself, I'll include approximate instructions to get it running on your computer. If anyone knows that some of these parts are not necessary, feel free to edit them out. But they should be sufficient.
Despite what old SE questions state, the PDF software Okular can now write annotations directly to the PDF. This makes it very useful in conjunction with Docear for annotating academic literature. However, Docear imports annotations from the comments, rather than importing from highlighted text. In Okular, when you highlight text it can then be clicked to reveal a comments bubble, which is empty by default. Copying the highlighted text into the resulting bubble allows it to be imported into Docear, but this is laborious. 
To do this you need all the dependencies to build Okular from source. They are listed here: https://okular.kde.org/download.php . There's quite a few of them there.
