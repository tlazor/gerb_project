In Linux, I can ask pidgin to close via pkill pidgin or kill [pid]. The program will then take care of it and shut itself down.
The utility you want is taskkill.exe, which is a command-line program built into the Windows OS (roughly analogous to kill on Unix-like systems) and found in the system directory (C:\Windows\System32\taskkill.exe). By default, it asks (but does not force) programs to exit, and does not use window messages.
Windows doesn't work this way. A WM_CLOSE signal will only close the window, not the process (just like when you hit the x yourself).
Motivation: It seems that many XMPP servers need the clients to actively say "goodbye" in order to realize they're offline. In other words, there are no keep-alive packets needed or there are no timeouts (and if, quite delayed). Usually, this is no big problem, because we start and exit our clients accordingly (counting shutdown as exiting). However, if one goes into suspend/hibernate mode, it's just as if the network connection were gone suddenly - no chance for pidgin to say "hey there, going offline". So, I need a script to automatically close pidgin gracefully (to be executed directly before suspending).
Run taskkill /? from a command line shell (cmd or powershell) for usage information, but the basic command you want is taskkill /im pidgin.exe (note that the extension is necessary on the image name of the program to kill). Do NOT pass the /f flag here, as this will forcibly terminate the program (analogous to kill -9) without giving it time to perform any cleanup (though that is useful for programs you want to kill immediately, or that are hung and don't respond to normal close requests).
