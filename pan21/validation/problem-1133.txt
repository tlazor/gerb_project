Problem is that mdadm output will always say it recreated array just fine, but the data contained in /dev/md0 will be wrong.
one of the things I've found is that mdadm --create /dev/md0 --assume-clean will only work correctly if you use same (or close) version of mdadm that was used to create original array. That is becase they use different offsets for data and metadata, even if same superblock version (like 1.2)
In my case the problem was 6-disk RAID5 which was being grown to 7 disks, but it didn't progress at all so was aborted and wouldn't assemble anymore with mdadm: Failed to restore critical section for reshape, sorry., and --force and --invalid-backup weren't helping either, so I had to use --create --assume-clean
for example, using recent mdadm 3.3.2 or even previous 3.2.5 didn't work for me, but falling back to mdadm 3.1.4 (which created the array) worked just fine. 
Note that I also took care to specify drives in correct order (as detailed in mdadm --examine /dev/sd?) when recreating array and use overlay files for all the testing (in order not to increase the damage), using instructions at https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_failed_software_RAID
