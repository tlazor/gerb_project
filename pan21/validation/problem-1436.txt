Instead of getting work done for the past 2 hours I've been fighting this stupid problem. I would really appreciate any help I can get to stop this and permanently lock the connection as private...
and I do, and a flyout comes from the side asking me to allow this, which I do. I go to the network settings and I see that my connection I indeed private.
I "forgot" the connection and re-added it, but it never prompts me to choose if I want to access pcs on the network it just automatically defaults it to public.
So instead I go into Windows Explorer and open the Network section, where I am told "Network discovery is turned off. Network computers and devices are not visible. Click to change..."
I don't see anything in the EventViewer that would explain or even log the change, and I have absolutely no idea how to fix this...
I've tried changing the registry settings, I've tried changing the setting in secpol.msc (and looking at it now it is set to Private, even though the connection remains public).
