Also note, if $d$ is large but $n - d$ is not, you can do all of this and then take $\overline{G}$. If $d$ is $\frac{n}{2}$ or such, you'll need to be much smarter about step 2, probably implementing an algorithm to find a matching in the remaining graph.
The key comes in with how you perform step 2. If $d$ is fairly small, then a greedy random algorithm that avoids edges in $G$ should work. As $d$ gets larger the probability that an iteration doesn't increase the degree of your graph grows, and you'll need to start using a matching algorithm or at least looking for augmenting paths. I've deliberately underspecified step 2, because it is also where you'll get the variation in graph properties. For example, if $d$ is small you could run the algorithm 3 times with the following variations to step 2
A subset of the $d$-regular graphs are the $d$-regular graphs that are 1-factorizable (they're a union of perfect matchings). So
Regardless, unless you're keen on using graphs that aren't 1-factorizable, approaching it 1 degree at a time makes sense, because the marriage theorem tells you that you should always be able to perform step 2 to add another perfect matching (since the remaining edges are a regular graph, so they have a perfect matching).
