Are you using a vDistributed Switch (vDS) or a regular vSwitch? LACP only fully works with vDS and that's a feature that requires the Enterprise Plus licence.
If you don't have something that looks like this, where you've defined a "Link Aggregation Group", you may be going down the wrong path. 
I basically configured ESXi with etherchannel & VID settings as suggested by Vmware first. Once etherchannel is set, connection to esxi host was disconnect which means etherchannel is configured correctly. 
When teaming with etherchannel, a single TCP/UDP session will not enjoy the aggregate bandwidth of all links in your channel. It will be limited to a single link. So if you have 2 x 1GB links in your etherchannel, any one session will never exceed 1GB. Other TCP/UDP sessions will get balanced over all the links, helping to prevent saturation, but with a single TCP/UDP session, true aggregate bandwidth will never be achieved.
The response about LACP not being supported by standard vSwitch is correct. Etherchannel is supported by vSwitch though. So you're probably wondering what's wrong with etherchannel? 
There is the possibility of creating static aggregation without the distributed switch, but it offers no benefit over the default ESXi load balancing. It's not common.
Turn off the Etherchannel. You really can't make use of it in the situation you've described. If you're using a standard vSwitch, you can set load balancing policies and use multiple NICs using IP hash, but this is really being done on the ESXi side. LACP/Etherchannel doesn't come into play unless you are using a Distributed Switch (dvSwitch or vDS).
Standby NIC's assigned to the vSwitch provide fault tolerance but, there is some interruption involved, due to esx having populate upstream switch CAM tables with MAC addresses. Etherchannel is a step above ESX NIC failover.
Etherchannel still has uses though. It does help prevent link saturation when there are multiple sessions being balanced over the channel. It's also useful for creating fault tolerant connections from a switch stack, where you take ports from separate switches that participate in a stack, or chassis backplane, and put them in a cross-stack etherchannel, so a single switch failure won't take down your esx host.
