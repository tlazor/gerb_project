Your router's LAN side would have 192.168.0.1 and your router's public side would have the IP from your ISP.
For most people, their ISP issues them one IP. But they have multiple computers connected to their router.   And if in windows you open a cmd window and run ipconfig you see the private IP. e.g.  192.168.0.1
Almost every home user and the vast majority of businesses using almost any router on the market, uses NAT!
Use Network Address Translation (NAT Overload) on your router or gateway if you have such device. You create a pool of public addresses and allow certain subnet(s) to use these addresses using an Access Control List.
I still can't believe you haven't run into it!  Maybe some expensive Cisco routers don't do NAT 'cos they're really serious routers. But other than that, almost any router is a so-called router, and does NAT. They also do DHCP which in this case, is where you tell it to hand out IPs between say  192.168.0.2-192.168.1.254  or 192.168.0.1/24
I am using MS Windows 2008 and I have a laboratory with 100 computers. When we connected to the Internet we were allocated only 5 IP addresses (public) 168.167.43.226 - 230. This means we only have 5 computers through which we can access the Internet. How can we get all the computers having access to the Internet without applying for more IP addresses? I heard some people talking about the use of a proxy to generate more IPs. How true is that and how do you do it if its true?
those private addresses  don't go out on the internet.  A so-called router does NAT and DHCP so is both a "NAT device" and DHCP device, an dcan issue them out.
And yeah, another options is setting up a proxy server on one of the machines and come out to the internet through that one machine. But that will be a bottleneck
The NAT device could be called a type of proxy, and it modifies the packet in that it changes the IP.  There is then an issue of, what if you are running a server, how can the "router"/nat device know which computer to "forward" the packet to. Well, people often use NAT/PAT (which says, if the router got it on port 1234 then forward it to Computer 192.168.0.15 port 1234. Or they have managed to give that computer its own public IP.
