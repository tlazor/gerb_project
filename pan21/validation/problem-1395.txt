FFmpeg.org maintains this list of metadata tags per video container format that can be written back to the file using ffmpeg:
Still, there's the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP). Here's Adobe's official developer site. It's a standard developed by Adobe defined to store Metadata for media such as images and videos. The files are mostly XML, as XMP uses RDF for data representation.

Not surprisingly, MKV (Matroska) is the most agnostic container in terms of metadata support. The EU-supported PREFORMA project is currently standardizing the MKV container format for professional use in e.g. film archives.
These data are surfaced to iOS environments during video playback at runtime via timedMetadata notifications as well as in other environments that support surfacing this metadata.
"The MPEG-2 Program stream has provisions for non-standard data (e.g. AC-3 audio or subtitles) in the form of so-called private streams.[11] "
Oh, there are tagging facilities for videos, there's just not one single format for all video containers. Most containers roll their own solution, such as FLV and MKV.
The features for MP4/M4V and MOV are very much centered around iTunes compatibility. In general, most video containers have a quite fixed metadata structure.
ID3 formatted data may be populated into Program Streams of MPEG-2 as defined by Apple (http://www.smpte-ra.org/mpegreg/ID3.html).
