I would recommend trying elscreen: http://www.morishima.net/~naoto/software/elscreen/ Basically it allows you to create groups of buffers and switch between them as if they were tabs in a web browser. One of my favourite features of elscreen is that frame splits can be different between each group, which can be very useful when working on different tasks.
Exactly fitting your needs is the perspective mode (https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el). It fits exactly the case that your describing which is similar to the workspaces concept in GNOME and KDE. This mode works great with projectile-mode  and helm-mode, which enhance your emacs to handle projects better and search through them better respectively. 
This example, will group buffers in org together. Buffers that have c-mode, c++-mode, pels-mode etc will be grouped.
I think you might be looking for something like ibuffer (built into the most recent versions). Its basically like dired for buffers.
If you do not want to go through the hassle of setting up these modes all by yourself, I suggest you install the prelude for emacs and simple setup perspective along with it. You can checkout my emacs configuration (https://github.com/ksinkar/prelude) to see how I have done it.
