the best way is make your game self recordable. Easy way is just save every frame with fixed framerate. With SSD it takes "no" time. Harder way is to make your own "fraps". If You do it. You can directly communicate with your game.
You might want to try vnc2flv, but it won't do audio itself (you can add in an audio track later though). Not sure if your CPU will hate you trying to do realtime FLV encoding alongside a running game though.
Although, I've wondered the same question too, because recording a video is only half the process (if that). The other half is editing it, adding effects, etc. Windows Movie Maker kinda works but it's fairly simplistic... and crashy.
I've used Windows Media Encoder a couple of times to record videos of my games and tools - it's free and produdes good quality videos. 
Devices like these are super cheap, and I bet you can get a hold of a second computer to run it on (it doesn't need anything special) so you can capture your game from your game running machine (be sure to have a computer with S-Video out for this cheap version). There is also something like this for higher quality capture - http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/intensity/ but requires USB 3 and is more expensive, but you can capture HDMI and higher resolution. I really see no better option than either of these two.
