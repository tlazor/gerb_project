I tried CamStudio, which is very recommended over internet, but its not close enought. Whats interesting is, when I am recording something using it, I get low FPS, but my CPU usage is on barely 20%. On most used core. I just dont get it. I am sure I set everything fine. So why isnt CamStudio using at least one of my cores at 100% ? I have Core i5 4 physical cores at 4 GHz. In addition I have 4GB of 1600MHz DDR3 RAM and ma ysystem use SSD drive. This setup MUST be able to capture even full HD in more than 30 FPS. Please, do you know about any program that could do it? I can record with FRAPS games at my native 1680x1050, even demanding like Bad Company 2 on HIGH setting and still get 30FPS video with enought power left for 50 FPS at game. And from what I know, Windows 7 desktop runs as D3D. Thanks.
You should download SCREEN2SWF. It records up to 30FPS it has a built-in editor and it's easy to use. You can pause/play start/stop recordings. It supports windows. (I'm not sure about mac. I have windows 10 you can check yourself) SCREEN2SWF was no where seen in suggestions in other websites. I searched up '30 fps screen recorders' and saw that.
