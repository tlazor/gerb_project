Note that at this level, you are working with analog signal as much as digital bits, so the electricity is flowing like water through a network of pipes, and the circuitry is allowing more or less water through different pathways. 
Your question is really more in the realm of electrical engineering than in computer science, so its a bit off topic, but I'll see what I can do.
The ALU uses Combinational Logic in its layout, such that the electricity flows through the entire circuit, and its output varies based on the input received. It does not select a set of gates to use, all of the gates are receiving signal, but the  layout of the circuit creates a reproducible transformation of the input signal carrying the result.
The Execution unit driving the instruction sends it the ALU for processing, and on the next clock tick, expects the result to be available on one of the ALUs output registers. 
Perhaps I'm not thinking about this correctly, but when you give the CPU a command such as Multiply Registers (MR) R2,R4 how does it decide which logic gates it will use, is it just the first gates available or is there something I'm not aware of going on under the hood. I understand a CPU has millions of logic gates so how does it manage their use correctly?
Your multiply instruction would be queued to an Arithmetic Processing Unit on one of its input/output connections.
