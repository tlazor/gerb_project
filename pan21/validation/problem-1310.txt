Well this is stupid. I use cobbler which already have support for setting hostname, ip, subnet and dns information. You have to add it as a system, like this:
Cobbler then have a snippet that applies this for you, called "post_install_network_config". Let me know if anyone have any questions.
It looks like you're trying to set them with static values. If possible, use DHCP to set these items instead.
cobbler system add --name=[...] --profile=[...]--ip=10.1.1.2 --gateway=10.1.1.1 --hostname=yourhostname.exmaple.org --name-servers="10.1.1.1" --static=true --mac=00:50:56:af:56:22
I know this is an old question, but I wanted to contribute this answer for any one finding this by search:
You mentioned trying to do user interaction during kickstart. I don't think that is possible, although I could be wrong. I do know that user interaction during RPM installations is impossible; this would make it impossible to script. The same could(and if I were the head architect , would) be impossible and for the same reasons. Instead, place these values on a floppy disk.
