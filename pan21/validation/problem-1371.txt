For what it's worth, I simply turned ON the WINS server option in smb.conf and things now work as I wanted. My machine and its workgroup show up around my LAN both on both other linux and Windoze devices.
But I think that simplistic config runs into problems. I can't ping my Debian device by its hostname, for example. And I assume at some point Windows may get all confused.
I'm still working through these issues myself. My understanding at this point is that your fundamental problem is that, without some centralised system to recognise namings, there's no way to identify devices by their names.
In the case of just standard hostname resolution for something like a ping, you actually need a local DNS to resolve your host names to IP addresses. 
Setting up a local DNS is the ultimate solution (which I plan to do eventually). It looks like WINS is an alternative solution (not mutually exclusive), that offers basically the same thing. The advantage is that it looks like it's relatively easy to set up your Samba server as a WINS server. But I haven't looked into how.
It seems that different protocols have their own ways around this. I think Windows goes through a network discovery process (like a broadcast and response or maybe even IP scanning) and thus discovers devices that way. I'm able to see my Debian Samba share by the hosts name on my Windows network, and I haven't set up a DNS or WINS.
