I found additional HSTS data that was not deleted via "Forget About This Site" or clearing the browser cache in a file SiteSecurityServiceState.txt in my profile directory.
Changing end-users browsers is not really a good option if you mistakenly applied the "Strict-Transport-Security" HTTP Response Header to your web site/server.
@Spike's answer did work for me with Firefox (I up-voted it).  Watching the SiteSecurityServiceState.txt file helped me test this solution.
If you have access to the web server set the max-age to zero, it will clear the HSTS cache for the site(s) for Firefox/Chrome.  In my case, I had to open the site, close the browser and then reopen the site after this web server setting was enabled.
Hint: If you are looking for a temporary fix, opening a private browsing window will not import Firefox's saved HSTS settings, so at least you can access the site during that private session.
In chrome I can inspect the HSTS status for any given domain by going to chrome://net-internals/#hsts
I host two domains on my webserver. One uses HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), the other does not. My webserver was misconfigured for a short period, thereby accidentally setting HSTS on the wrong website. 
I just ran into this problem.  Clearing the browser cache and "forgetting" the site did not work for me.
It is a text file you can open with any text editor and remove lines of HSTS data about a speficic host. Or clear the whole file.
This has caused my Firefox to get all confused, and it insists on accessing the site using HTTPS, which is no good.
