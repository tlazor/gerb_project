What the clockwise bit is saying is... say you have these three points and called Plane(p0, p1, p2):
Since there is no Debug.DrawPlane I don't know whether my plane works as expected. Are all 3 Vectors world coordinates? Or are they connected to each other? Can somebody elaborate how this works? Neither can I make any sense of "The points go around clockwise as you look down on the top surface of the plane"
Note how if you trace your finger from p0 to p1 to p2, your finger moves clockwise. Further you can curl the fingers of your left hand to follow that clockwise direction. When you do that, the direction you can stick your thumb out in represents the normal of the place, and points towards the front half-space of the plane. If you do that while holding your hand up to the monitor, your thumb is probably pointing at your face. Your face is "looking down" on to the "top surface" of this plane because you see the points forming a clockwise traversal.
Note that if you called Plane(p2, p1, p0) -- the opposite order -- and your curled the fingers of your left hand to follow that now-counter-clockwise traversal, your thumb would be pointing towards the screen. Your face would then be "looking up" at the "bottom surface" of the plane.
Any three points in space describe a plane that passes through all of those points. The points are not "connected" except in the sense that they all lie on the plane you want to describe.
The most common reason to care about the front side of the plane is that that is the one things usually collide with. Generally we ignore collisions with the back side of planes, although you can certainly compute them if your game needs it. Often you will need to opt-in to doing so however, as many libraries may assume you just want collisions with the front side.
The plane is in the same space that coordinates are, so if you provide world-space coordinates, the plane will be in world space.
The ordering (or winding) of the points, the part that says "the points go clockwise as you..." indicates how the front and back "sides" of the plane are determined. A plane divides 3D space into two halves, determining which side of the plane is the "front" (or top) lets us reliably talk about those two spaces.
