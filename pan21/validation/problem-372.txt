If DDNS is not leveraged, one side will require to have a public static IP in order to provide a peer IP Address for the remote dynamic peer to initiate interesting traffic. I recommend strongly in getting real time support from Cisco TAC on this configuration and the requirements.
You could establish a VPN from each site to a third one, and route accordingly (as suggested in comment by @peterh).
To allow IPSEC tunnel between two sites behind NAT you should have at least one site with NATted udp/500 and udp/4500 from outside to inside.
Personally I would try to work with the ISP to have a solution, and if the ISP cant / doesn't want to help, change the ISP.
If you can't forward port on any of the two sites, you cannot establish a VPN directly between the two sites.
Get yourself an external server with a static address, connect VPNs out from both sites and tie the tunnels together on the external server.
A static IP for at least one side is advised; however, DDNS will work for this,(if both sides are assigned dynamic addresses and NAT Overloaded), while both routers have fqdn's assigned for dynamic tracking of peer: 
Additonally, if your ISP routers don't support IPsec traversal you'll be better off with SSL VPN. As peterh suggested, OpenVPN might be a good choice.
