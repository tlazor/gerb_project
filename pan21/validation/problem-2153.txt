I have a custom class that I serialize/deserialize to/from file(s), and is not guaranteed to be identical each time the game runs (in this example, a language pack. it's possible to fix a typo manually). As a result, I do not use UnityEngine.Object on it, and deserialize it each load. However, some classes that implement UnityEngine.Object (Monobehavior), have references to it. these references must persist (so that the language stays the same each load) 
Naturally, I'd prefer this not be the case. again from Unity documentation linked above: When you need to serialize a complex object graph with references, do not let Unity automatically serialize the objects. Instead, use ISerializationCallbackReceiver [interface] to serialize them manually.
I know how to implement the interface. How do I preserve the reference? (Disclaimer: not an expert in serialization, so if it's a simple fix, I'm sorry. Unity documentation doesn't provide an example for references).
As per the Unity Scripting page, https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Serialization.html, this can cause undesired behavior: "If you store a reference to an instance of a custom class in several different fields, they become separate objects when serialized. Then, when Unity deserializes the fields, they contain different distinct objects with identical data."
