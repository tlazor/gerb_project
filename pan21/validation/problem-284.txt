My problem is that when database size is very large and I request for large data(35-40 mb) from it, it takes so much time (10-20 minutes)to get data.
If you`re using Entity Framework make sure you load the data first using .Load() function which will load the data in memory on the application side, and then you can use it with [Table].Local.[some action].
If many rows - perhaps your application does not manage data well, after downloading it.  Or perhaps it requests and downloads one row at a time.
You should do a snapshot of waits that are occurring on the server, especially pay attention on async_network_io wait and once you do, rerun the request again, check to see if you`re getting waits here, which would indicate that theres a problem within you application itself, and it cannot process data that fast.
If large columns - maybe you can choose more economical data types.  Perhaps you used nchar when you don't need it.  (If you need it, then, use it.)  Your text may be padded with unnecessary space, either because you use char instead of varchar, or because data came from a source which includes the spaces at the end of text, and varchar will hold the space until it is removed from data, i.e. RTRIM(column_name) - I think this automatically becomes varchar(length) or nvarchar(length), but check that.
