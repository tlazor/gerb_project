The primary reason is when your system is using additional kernel modules not included in the distribution, for instance to support specific hardware. You might be dependent on a third party vendor providing the update for that. 
The historic reason may be because unless explicitly configured otherwise an upgrade replaces the old version of a package and that may be problematic if that happens to running kernel. (Although the defaults for yum are to install new kernels and not upgrade them, making that a non-issue)
to update/upgrade, if I want to update kernels, I would manually type the right commands to update the kernel packages.
I was googling about yum and reading some articles when I stumbled on bunch of articles about disabling yum from update kernel packages. Now I'm wondering why I should do that. When I update system I update all packages. Even if kernel update will mess up something you can always boot with older one (Centos has ability to maintain few kernels). In the end if you have bad day update of any package can mess things up, but keeping system up to date is one of basics rules of security.
This setting is by default, that would says, if i update my current kernel and something bad broke my server during the system update, i can come back to the previous kernel.
If you use Fedora, the kernel will update very often, after that it will add a new item in the GRUB2 menu at startup screen, I always keep previous one and current one, when the new kernel messes up the operating system, I would scroll back to the previous kernel. So I made aliases up/ug to
