Now I can send e-mails (with a correct user authentication) via SMTP using port 25 without encryption as well as using e.g. port 465 with SSL/TLS.
I already commented out "smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes" in the postfix main.cf file at /opt/mailcow/data/conf/postfix/main.cf, but now I get the error message "Relay access denied" when I try to send an email to an external domain's address. At least I can send emails to myself (on my mailserver) now using port 25 without encryption, but I need to send emails to external addresses. 
How can I allow to send unencrypted mails using SMTP port 25 with (plain text) password authentification - without SSL/TLS? I need to enable this, because I have some old IP cameras that are not able to use an encryption to send emails...
I've got it working without setting up a relay inside the LAN and/or adding IP addresses to mynetworks in the Postfix configuration. I've set the value of the parameter smtpd_tls_auth_only in Postfix's main.cf from "yes" to "no". I also allowed SASL authentication for SMTP on port 25 in Postfix's master.cf file by changing the value for smtpd_sasl_auth_enable from "no" to "yes".
