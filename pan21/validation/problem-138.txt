The problem is that it will return "x" or "o", but it won't return anything for "nope, no winner yet."
If you make those two changes, I think your code will be a lot smaller, and easier to understand, and easier to review. I'd encourage you to submit a new review with that code.
Before anything else, I'm going to point out to you that you have a function called testwon. It almost works.
In addition to that change, I'd like you to find places where code is copied, and convert those into a function. For example, all your checks of if validated == "1", etc. 
The principle is called "DRY" for Don't Repeat Yourself. It applies in a lot of ways, but this is the most basic: if you write code two times, make it a function (or a macro) and maintain it in one place.
This is because a for loop would run a fixed number of times, but it's possible to win in 5 moves (xoxox) or it might take 9 moves (xoxoxoxox). Since you don't know how many, you want to "keep going until something changes." That's a while loop.
