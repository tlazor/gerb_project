A final possibility is to use a 3rd-party tool to run the command prompt with a hidden window.  I've heard of such things but never had a use for them, so I don't know of anything in particular to point you to.
One caveat to this is that if you're running a console-mode program, which many script interpreters are, the batch file will wait for the program to exit, and using start will spawn a new console window.  What you need to do in this case is run the Windows-based version of the interpreter instead of the console-based one -- no start necessary.  For Perl, you would run wperl.exe instead of perl.exe.  For Python, it's pythonw.exe instead of python.exe.  The old win32 Ruby distribution I have downloaded has rubyw.exe, which should do the same thing.
When converting into an executable, you will find an option to run your file as an Invisible application in the visibility section. Thus, when you run it, it will run without a window.
You can't -- executing a batch file with the built in Command Prompt is going to keep a window open until the batch file exits.
You can run another batch file with START /MIN CMD.EXE /C mybatchfile.bat from within the command prompt. 
From outside it will bring the cmd console window but to avoid that, you can create a shortcut file with properties modified to start minimized.
What you can do is take steps to make sure that the batch file exits as quickly as possible.  If at all possible, modify the batch file to run whatever program with the start command.  By default, start returns immediately without waiting for the program to exit, so the batch file will continue to run and, presumably, exit immediately.  Couple that with modifying your shortcut to run the batch file minimized, and you'll only see the taskbar flash without even seeing a window onscreen.
