This is a known issue with Win 10 if you have older VPN software installed like Cisco or in my case Junos. What worked for me was to uninstall the VPN and reboot. However the articles out there suggest registry editing:
I saw that a Windows Update had been installed this morning, about the time that the wifi crapped out. Did a system restore back to the update installation and voila---my wifi adapter was back.
However I got the "registry key not found so I unstalled the VPN, reboot and wifi is back. Next I installed a new version from Win 10 store and everything works great!
I just had the same issue. Drove me nuts. No connection options listed except Broadband and dial-up (what year is this??), with an Ethernet connection.
I have had same issues but got it resolved. Always turn off the wifi of PC/Laptop before shutdown. Whenever PC/Laptop is again started wifi adaptor will be available under network adaptor tab. Switch on Wifi and search for required wifi network.
PS: If you want to create a wifi hotspot (when your wireless adapter is working properly), try the following command in Command Prompt
