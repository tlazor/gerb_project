So...we create a page w/ a Search Core Results web part - and then set the Fixed Keyword Query to use ContentClass:STS_Site.  Gives us a nice list which we can then configure to display what we want.  Its updated when the team sites are indexed so it's dynamic and personalized for the user.
What we wanted to do, is create a webpage that shows users a list of the 10 or 20 out of 200+ teamsites that they have permissions to get to.  
We are doing something kind of similar - I can describe it - and see if it gets you any closer.  It's definitely a "think outside the box" solution.
That list is going to be different for each person - and changes as they move from team to team as well as when new teams are created or disbanded.
Now - as I said - this is NOT to straight solution to your request - however, you could borrow from this idea to create a page w/ a search results page and fixed query that returns the sites you are trying to steer them toward.  They'd still need to click to get there - but at least the link would be there and it would be customized.
