The other question to ask yourself is, "is it worth all this trouble just so that users can't change their background picture and access the command prompt?" In most small organizations, the answer is probably, "no, it isn't," so if your supervisor is demanding that you implement these restrictions - which more often than not get in the user's way rather than save anybody time - you should really make the argument that if they want to enforce those rules, they'll have to buy the proper tools to make it possible.
Oddly enough, everything you are asking to do is part of the reason why PCs SHOULD join a domain. Since you can do pretty much everything you ask for with the OS. But I digress.  You can do this all manually without joining a domain by logging onto each computer and first changing the Local Admin password.  
The home versions of Windows are not designed to be centrally managed.  It used to be done on Windows 3.11 and Win9x using Novell Netware, but I have not seen that being used anywhere for many years.
If you can swing some Windows 7 Pro licenses, but don't want to pay for a Windows Server license (which can be quite pricey), there's also the option of using SAMBA as your domain controller. This gives you most of the functionality you're asking for - essentially, the ability to set up group policy. It runs on Linux, and there are also lots of options for internet filtering which run on Linux as well.
You'll want to check out the Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows. This gives a comprehensive list of all Group Policy Settings (which are what you use to restrict users' desktop actions), including - most importantly - the registry settings for these restrictions. There are a few problems though:
An alternative is to look at Windows Small Business Server. It is still a chunk of change, but I ask that you rethink your decision.  Keep in mind if you lock down these computers, you'll have to pretty much login to EACH computer to update a single component, like Flash.  Otherwise, every time your users log in, they'll be presented with the Flash update dialog, then try to update, and they have to cancel cause they don't have admin rights.  And that will continue EVERY TIME THEY LOG IN, until you get around to their machine . . . 
You're going to have to set up a server. I'm surprised you didn't have one already with 30 PCs in one office. 
So yes, it is possible to get around the limitations of having Home editions of Windows, and hopefully that document will be a good place to start. But I still think it's going to be way more trouble than it's worth.
If your organization really can't afford Windows 7 Professional licenses (and really, trying to spin your own solution will most likely cost you more long-term because of all the development and support time, but as you wish), you can try to make your own solution. I've done this before for around 10 computers, so it's probably doable with 30, it'll just be painful, and if your organization grows even further, it'll really suck.
There are a few routes you could take. Ultimately, having a centrally managed system using Active Directory is going to be far easier for you than trying to jerry-rig the functionality built-in to Professional versions of Windows, but there are options:
Humm, I did think of a faster way.  Save the registry edits that Group Policy editor does and merge them into each computer.  Dangerous yes.  But free!!!!!!!!!
Use the Group Policy editor to change the current settings on the computer.  Go to the next computer.  Rinse and repeat for 30 computers . . .
