Is your new memory the same speed as the old memory?  It could be that the motherboard is set for interleaving, and there is an issue between the two ram sticks...
 Or a second Idea would be to update the Bios. Or check the mother board makers web site for software updates. Or simple you may have a bad Mobo. Or the memory may be bad. 
Nobody seems to be considering the motherboard as the culprit, although it very well could be. The more memory modules you use, the more strain there is on the northbridge. There could be underlying issues with that motherboard and multiple RAM modules. Maybe there is something wrong with the northbridge. Do you have another motherboard to test them out on?
If not that then if you could find some other RAM to swap in to see if the RAM is the problem.  Or but the RAM in another computer, etc.
Does this speed decrease occur even when the new memory is the only memory in the system?  It's possible that there is an Bios issue with 4 Gb of memory...  Are there any Bios updates for your system?
That really sounds like a hardware problem; there is no reason that should be happening.  Have you checks for a BIOS update for your motherboard?
