As for defragging - this practice is becoming less and less important as access speed increases.  Unless you spend lots of time fetching data, I'd not worry about it at all.
There is a great Google study with a lot of data, which is probably the single objective information source on the matter.
I'm not an computer hardware expert But, I have 6 HDD that is dead and used by me. After losing 6 HDD, I do an research about what exactly cause hard drive failure. And Here is the result of my research:
Lastly, keep the drive and system off the desk to reduce vibration from your keyboarding/mousing/pounding and dropping things on the desk.  Elevate it off the floor a couple of inches to reduce dust sucking into it.  Don't use the computer as a footrest or kick it.
Also, from what I gather elsewhere and from my experience, spinning up the drive is probably the most stressful operation and most drives fail at that moment. So if that makes sense for you, don't spin down the drive and don't turn off the computer; except for laptops where I guess it's more important to save battery then disk.
For your first question - keeping cool - yes it is very important for your entire system.  I've seen cases with failed fans get the hard drives so hot you can't hold them.  Needless to say, those drives failed.  I don't recommend forcibly cooling the system (say by putting an air conditioner in front of it) since that may cause condensation and hot/cold cycling problems.  Just keep the system inside clean to allow for good airflow.
As for make/model...  I'd say look at the warranty.  Basic economics would tell you that drive manufacturers warranty their drive for as little time as they can get away with.  If they warrant the drive for 2 years or 5 years, they usually expect that most of their drives won't fail in that timeframe, otherwise they get stuck with RMA's.  So, I would tend to believe that drives with short warranties are dicier than those with long warranties.
As far as spinup/spindown, I can't see it matters much.  After all, the most reliable drives are usually those in servers or other systems that are running 24x7x365.  I doubt that the spindle motor is likely to be a major problem.  More likely is that the electronics will fail - whether turning the entire system off/on has been a flamewar forever - I'd say leave power savings on and allow it to spindown the drives and turn on power savings for your system in general - take your savings from less electrical use and buy another drive for backup.
As for SSDs, they're only limited by the number of write cycles they can perform on each cell in their flash memory.  Theoretically, SSDs can last many, many years longer than HDDs since there are no moving parts.
