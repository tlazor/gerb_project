Constants (in your case AND) should be declared final static, so Java only allocate memory once for the value (and not for every new object).
Sometimes you surround the plus operator (+) with spaces, sometimes you don't. Do it consistently. Preferable surrounded by spaces.
Only constants should be written uppercase (and might contain underscores). Other variable names should not contain underscores rather use camelcase (e.g. apiUrl).
setCity_id and setCity_name are no setters. They add something to a string. Either handle it like the setAPI_KEY method where you are storing the value in a variable which you later use to concatenate the string. Or rename the method to e.g. addCity_name to make it clear that there's a difference.
The usage of blank lines in your setXXX methods are not consistent. I wouldn't use any blank lines at all in those methods but if you want to use them, use them consistently.
That's inconsistent. API_KEY should be appended on its own. Beside that since Java 9 it's most of the times better to use the plus operator instead of a StringBuffer (https://dzone.com/articles/jdk-9jep-280-string-concatenations-will-never-be-t)
