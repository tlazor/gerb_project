We can assume that the subgraph with the heaviest MST includes all of the degree-one vertices, because adding one of these vertices to a subset can never decrease the number of components. So the vertices that were removed to form the subgraph are a subset of $G$. We can assume also that these removed vertices form a vertex cover of $G$. For, if some other induced subgraph is formed by removing vertices that do not form a vertex cover, and $uv$ is an edge that is not covered, then removing $v$ leads to an induced subgraph that is at least as good: it has one less vertex but one more connected component, created by the degree-one vertex of $H$ that was attached to $v$.
Make a new graph $H$ with twice as many vertices, by attaching a new degree-one vertex to each vertex of $G$. Turn $H$ into a metric space by making the distance between adjacent vertices equal to $1$ and the distance between non-adjacent vertices equal to $2$. For this metric space, the weight of a minimum spanning tree of an induced subgraph equals the number of vertices plus the number of connected components of the subgraph minus one.
So the optimal subgraph of $H$ is formed by removing a vertex cover from $G$. Such a subgraph will have exactly $n$ components (one for each degree-one vertex added to $H$, either by itself or connected to a vertex of $G$), and a number of vertices equal to $2n-k$ where $n=|V(G)|$ and $k$ is the size of the cover. Thus, the weight of its MST will be $3n-k+1$. To maximize this, we must minimize $k$.
Given a metric undirected graph G (edge lengths satisfy triangle inequality), find a set S of vertices such that MST(G[S]) is maximized, where MST(G[S]) is the minimum spanning tree of the subgraph induced by S. Has this problem been studied before? Is it NP-hard? Thanks a lot.
