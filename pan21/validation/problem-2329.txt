I have had a problem like this before.  Plugging in the flash drive would work for a moment and then the drive would disappear. The cause in my case was a drive letter conflict.  it seemed that the SD card reader was attempting to use the same drive letter for the removable SD card slot.  I had to go into computer manager.  Right click on my computer -> select manage then go to disk administrator.  Here you can give the removable storage a different drive letter and this should resolve the conflict. 
Q: When I plug in my USB drive I hear the audible "ding" sound but nothing happens after that. I don't see that the drive is being recognized at all. If I leave the thumb drive plugged in and reboot, Vista will then recognize it. How can I get the system to recognize the thumb drive without rebooting the system?
Chek your warranty. I had similar symptoms with a Sandisk Cruzer. Mine was the Titanium model, and still under the warranty (4 years I think), so Sandisk sent me a replacement.
If you have anything important that you need to get off it, you might (like me) just get it working long enough to get those files, by repeatedly unplugging and replugging it. 
Sounds like a flaky flash drive.  If it has demonstrated itself to be problematic, and replacing it would set you back all of ~$15.00, why try to salvage it?  I say it should "hit the dustbin".
