I think the Windows installer is failing to launch the UAC prompt to request admin rights when double-clicked.  The command prompt trick works around this.
On a PC with UAC enabled, the oft-mentioned answer of "Run the installer as Administrator" is not descriptive enough, because if you install it in the default location Programs (x86) then every time you use the program as a non-Administrator you will get the annoying UAC pop-up "This program wants to make changes to your computer..."  very annoying.  The other answer "don't install it, just unzip it in My Documents and run it" is also insufficient because then I found that you cannot set Notepad++ as the default application for specific file types (maybe because it was not officially installed?)  ---  So my solution that takes care of both issues was to run the installer as Administrator, but override the install location to my own personal My Documents\Programs\Notepad++ folder.  Now both issues are solved.
I just experienced the same issue with the new v6.3.2.  Uninstalling, rebooting, and trying the previous version resulted in the same failure.  
We ran into this at the office. UAC was enabled. The setup program doesn't elevate itself. Right-click on the installer and, "Run As Administrator."
I ended up starting an "Administrator" command prompt and running the installer from there.  It worked.
