I will give you one note of warning. With the old wiring in my house, the phone company had looped the same strands through multiple phone jacks and tapped into the middle of the strands. Make sure that you are putting jacks on the ends of unbroken strands, and that there arent other jacks or splices in the middle somewhere.
Hmm... I thought that I posted an answer earlier but maybe I didn't. Anyhoo, CAT3 cable will support 10mbps Ethernet (10BASE-T) but not FastEthernet (100BASE-TX) so it should be possible to use it for Ethernet if there are enough pairs and if the connectors are terminated correctly. It doesn't matter which wires you use as long as you use the same colors on both sides of the "run" and terminate the connectors correctly.
As someone who is doing this currently, I can say that it does work. As Scott pointed out, you only actually use 2 of the pairs for standard ethernet. (the other pairs are used for Power over Ethernet though).
You will obviously get better performance from Cat5, but your landlord might have something to say about ripping out the current wiring. Over a short distance, you might even get 100Mb out of it.
Plain old telephone cable (two twisted pairs) is good for 10Mbit Ethernet for runs of 10..20 metres. Your switch will automaticall fall down to 10Mbit if the quality of the transmission is not suitable for higher speeds.
Tut Systems sells baluns that can be used to use phone wire for low-speed ethernet, however, using wifi is going to give better performance.  You could use VDSL adaptors, but, the cost of those for the short range 100mb/sec is going to exceed the cost of getting 802.11n adaptors and a gateway.  Getting anything above 100mb/sec over those wires is going to be almost impossible.
