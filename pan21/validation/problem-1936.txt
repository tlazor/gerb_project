There isn't a huge difference between putting all code in the constructor, or putting all code in a method that must always be called after construction. And both approaches aren't all that great, as having one giant method is hard to maintain, hard to read, hard to test, and hard to use.
In this controller, you would now have methods that are responsible for the actions that can be taken. So you might have a show method, an add method, etc. Then you would create a router, which would link a given URL to the correct method in the correct controller.
But first things first, what is an AddController? Generally, controllers are associated with some kind of item, not some kind of action. So you might have a SpecificItemController, which can add, edit, update, delete, show, list, etc SpecificItems. But you wouldn't have an AddController which can add SpecificItemA, SpecificItemB, etc. (you might have controllers that aren't directly item specific, but more action specific, such as a LoginController, but that's a bit different).
