It's UDP based, and handles network changes very well.  I've experienced it many times with my cellphone switch from wifi(s) to LTE and vice-versa.
Ideally, I'd have some background application, similar to Dropbox, that maintains a connection (reconnects) to some external service with a known address. Then, whenever I want to SSH from one computer to another, the service arranges for a connection to be made. I have a Raspberry Pi that has a DynDNS address and forwarded ports, so I can run the service myself if need be. But it's important that the traffic doesn't go via that server, since I don't want my two uni computers to be sending data home and back when they're sitting next to each other.
Create few tunnels from your RPi device to each other you need access to, and you can SSH to them using local RPi ports.
Except for Android, you can also connect to multiple networks at once.  Connecting to a network creates a virtual network card in your OS.
I have a number of linux computers at home, at uni, and my android phone. I'd like some way to be able to SSH to any one of them at any time, but they're all hidden behind different networks, and they may lose their connection or change their external IP address at any time.
Alternatively, is there a free VPN service similar to the old Hamachi that would work across several linux computers and android? Then they would all be on one pseudo-local network and could ssh between each other freely. As near as I can see, there are no such free services at the moment, which seems strange given the abundance of free file-syncing services (Dropbox, Google Drive, Mega, etc).
They call it "Software Defined Networking".  It's kind of a mix between a VPN and services like Hamachi.  Basically, you have to ability to create networks (that have unique IDs), to which you can connect and authorize devices.  It's a P2P network, but can use super nodes if your network doesn't allow inbound connections.
