ZZZ.ZZZ.ZZZ.ZZZ is the primary HAProxy server, and WWW.WWW.WWW.WWW is the secondary HAProxy server (and not relevant right now to this problem).
It's probably the health checks that are triggering the ban, as they're not sending a hostname.  You can try using 'httpchk' or 'ssl-hello-chk' instead, which might resolve the issue and allow you to re-enable fail2ban. 
Apache and the vhosts configs on the web server, are configured to listen to port 9009, as per the HAProxy config. Everything is running fine up to this point.
Is it so, that HAProxy needs additional ports open on the web server (this is what I suspect) and if so what would those undocumented ports be, or does anyone know what could be wrong here?
I have a fairly standard HAProxy / Web Cluster setup, which is running perfectly fine - as long as I don't enable the Shorewall firewall on the web cluster servers.
There are other rules in the rules file, which for instance allows SSH on a certain port from a specific IP address, and those rules all work, so I assume (although I could be wrong) it has little to do with the Shorewall firewall rules per say.
Now, I switch on Shorewall Firewall on the web server, with a firewall rules file that looks like this:
As soon as I do, error messages appear in the HAProxy server's syslog, and the websites served via HAProxy returns 503.
