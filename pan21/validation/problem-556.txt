You could do an arms-length integration by using a web cam and image recognition to decide what number was rolled.  Get fancy and call it an "optical air interface" to make it sound official.
Parallel port is nice, but hard to find on a modern pc, and windows has made its programming rather difficult since XP or so.
You'll have to build an additional or different circuit to communicate with the PC. Something you make yourself would likely be over the Parallel port.
However, I'd recommend using a micro controller for communication. Something like the Arduino. Many have USB connections and will allow you to interface with your existing circuit with a few changes. Arduino also has plenty of helpful tutorials. Additionally, a micro controller will allow you to easily expand to other types of control inputs and hardware outputs. 
Or you could connect a button and 6 diodes to the port and let the computer do the rolling and lighting.
FYI this is how those lava lamp random number generators work, so there is good precedent.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand
