If you're needing SQLite to be used more widely, be wary... The reason is resolving dependency issues / recompiles for other libraries or applications also using sqlite's libraries. If you don't resolve these, you've no idea whether those will work or not.
Your PATH variable will determine whether /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin is searched first (based on the order of paths in that variable). If this is only for your use, you could also install the later sqlite in a subdirectory of your HOME directory and add it to your path.
In this case it'd probably be as simple as getting the spec file, bumping the version number, and deciding if the patches still apply to the new version.
What are you needing sqlite 3.6 for? If you're just needing it as a command-line application, then installing it from source as you have done is fine, it will just install in /usr/local/bin as you discovered.
The time to learn how to create RPMs is now. You will have no end to trouble unless you install software through the OS packaging system.
Me too experienced the same problem.  But on quitting and starting with a new Putty session window, it works fine.  It returns the latest version.  In my case, it is v3.7.3.
