As far as I can tell, this is not documented by Unity. But, if you look at that bug report and the dialog I had with Unity's rep, it is the intended behavior.
I don't see any option in the importer that might be doing that.  And I'm using the same localToWorldMatrix and the same coordinate data in the .obj file.  Hmmm
Look at the mesh instead of the game object in the inspector and see the orientation. Most of the times, exporters apply an overall transform.
Note that none of this depends on any modeling app. I did my tests with a file I created in Notepad. It all comes down to the OBJ file being specified as using a right-hand system, Unity using a left-hand system, and Unity negating the X-coordinate to convert from one to the other.
The difference between a r/h coordinate system & a l/h coordinate system is that the x axis is negated. I wonder if the object was created in a modeling app that uses one system while your development framework uses the other.
When I import my wavefront obj model into unity and then draw lines over it with the same coordinates in the obj file, the x coordinate is negated.
I had quite a discussion about this with Unity customer support, which you can see here. The short of it is this:
