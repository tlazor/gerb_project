I really only like the first option. The server would be pretty trivial to write. I'm not sure how much programming experience you have, but this can easily be done in nearly any scripting language (Python, Ruby, Javascript with node.js, PHP) or a modern compiled language (like Go).
This approach has some drawbacks, like you have to have the server installed for the page to work, but overall I think it's the best option.
Because of security restrictions, Javascript cannot execute system commands on the client. Possible ways to accomplish this (in order of preference):
However, if you just want a simple way to access remote servers without having to open putty first, I'm sure you could make a few launchers using putty's command-line parameters. Search Google for specific parameters to pass it.
I'm not entirely sure why you'd want to do this. Here's a rephrase of your question which I'll use as the basis of my answer:
Now user1@server1 user2@server2 user3@server3 are links.In case,If I want to log into unix account user1@server1 then, I can click on say user1@server1 ,then that should launch putty.exe with arguments user1@server1 from my local PC.So,this means that I will not need to launch putty.exe myself and then type in the server-name and user-name .This whole thing will be automated and will happen on just clicking on the link.Is this possible to implement ?
