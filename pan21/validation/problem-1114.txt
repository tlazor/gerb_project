This is a super broad question. I have no idea what you want to do with the game, the only thing I can say is everything needs to be contained within a while 1 infinite loop. There's not a lot of advice to give besides that. Just don't think about it too much, actually go start programming the game and you will realize what you need as you go. I mean it's pretty clear where you will need certain loops and stuff so just start working on that.
Make methods that seals each of the stages you have(possibly make them into a class), and a infinite loop is will be running on the Start() function along with your storyline.

I have been playing story based games such as lifeline or choice of games. I was wondering what game loop best describes what's happening logically? As when mauling over it myself in my head I am trying to come up with the patterns for developing something similar and I keep hitting a brick wall. Essentially allowing for choices. Text. Variables and conditions. Some text can even be re-used with additions to condition blocks. 
The actual game loop could be event based, where you press a button to load next page with little to no animation running.
obviously this would create an infinite loop if you hit a key I'm just trying to give you the general idea.
