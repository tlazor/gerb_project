You'll have modern secure system and browser for timeclock software and insecure but isolated from Internet system for bandsaw.
If your web-based timeclock software has only 2 or 3 menus with 4-5 options, I guess that asking a cheap programmer to develop a Windows 3.1 application that fetch data on the website and sends the appropriate data would be the simplest way to go. 
It's obviously a lot more destructive then just installing a browser... but it is both capable of running Windows 3.1 software in addition to more modern software like Firefox 3.6.
This is even better than leaving current setup - a 15 years old computer will break rather sooner than later and you'll have no means of replacing it. Moving virtual machine to another computer is almost as simple as moving a disk image file.
I would consider running screen sharing software.  After doing some research, it sounds like VNC was never ported to Windows 3.1, but you could try running pcAnywhere 9.2, which I believe is the last version that supports Windows 3.1.  I think the most important thing is to only run stable software on this machine, as there is no memory protection, no bug fixes in many years, and it's controlling an expensive and dangerous piece of equipment.  You can find another thread which discusses browser alternatives for Windows 3.1 here.  They seem to think that Opera is a bit unstable, and other browsers probably don't support all of the modern CSS that you need.
Chances are that your low-cost programmer already has Windows 3.1 as his primary OS on his 486 DX33.
