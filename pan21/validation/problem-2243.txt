Can anyone troubleshoot this or suggest an alternative option for resetting the adaptor automatically when the network drops as that seems to fix it. Do I need to add "Wireless Network Connection (%SSID%)" as the interface?
I found a similar question with an answer here but it was for a wired network and sadly, the solution doesn't work for my system.
It is a batch file as created below. I ran it, killed the wifi router which stopped the pings, but it did not complete the if statement to reset the interface. The command window simply shows the ping timed out and keeps repeating that until the connection is re-established. The log file does not log an error so it is never getting to the error portion of the if statement. I changed the original "Interface" var from "Local Area Connection" to "Wireless Network Connection"
The problem is that the wifi is unpredictable (due to odd router issues) and I need this system to be online at any given time of the day. Oddly, when the wifi drops, it does not tend to reconnect automatically even though it is still availble and windows is set to reconnect to it.
