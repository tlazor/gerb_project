I feel as though this is almost too simple. The reason I'm asking is because if anything is beyond my skill level we'll need to contract out an IT consultant which would require me to accommodate for that in future budgets.
My question is, what kind of considerations need to be made before changing a company name in the world of IT? Obviously our domain name will be changing, which means some work in Exchange but can anybody think of any thing else?
You'll need to configure Exchange to be authoritative for the new domain name if you want to recieve email using the new domain name, you'll need to setup\reconfigure your external DNS to reflect the new domain name (A records, MX records, etc.), you'll need to create\change your external web site to reflect the new domain name, etc., etc. These are a few of the things I see as being absolutes.
Nothing is "for sure" yet but there is a good chance my company will be changing it's name in the future.
A few of the maybe's might relate to changing your internal domain name and naming convention, depending on how it's currently configured and what the "powers that be" want it to be. If your internal domain name and naming convention reflects the old company name and everyone is OK with leaving it as it is going forward, then there's nothing to do. If not, then you've got some work to do internally as well.
