It converts a truetype font to one or more textures (with nicely packed glyphs), and outputs a little file containing the UVs and spacings (I find that the XML output is particularly easy to work with, and the quality of the spacing data is generally very good, even without true kerning)
Consider QML.  It's a fully functional UI library with an easy to use syntax.  Its feature set is significantly better than CEGUI in my experience, and it has better documentation, support and community since its primary target is desktop applications and the ability to render offscreen is just sort of a bonus.
If you want to use bitmap fonts, you can't go far wrong with the Angelcode Bitmap Font Generator: http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/
But whilst that is appealing, its not unusual to roll your own (and perhaps regret it as the scope increases later ;))
There are a lot of ways - depending on what you want... Like everywhere else, there isn't something like "the best solution". Which plattform is your target? Which language are you using? What is about text resizing/rotation - is it necessary? Do you need to be able to render TrueTypeFonts? Whats about Multilanguage/Unicode? How do you want to store your text (which encoding etc.)?
There is of course the question of generating the actual glyphs that you need.  There are programs like bmfont that you can use for that.  Or you might need rather more complicated rendering, e.g. freetype on demand.  I've been using bmfont with my own renderer quite happily, its very straightforward to deduce.
Sometimes you show transient text that might only appear for a handful of frames.  Just using GL_QUADS+glVertex will be sufficient.  But for any large quantity of text or any long duration of visibility its well worth putting the GL_QUADS in a VBO - I've noticed big performance improvements from this.
I used in the past also FTGL, as well as pure freetype (http://www.freetype.org/ FTGL is based on this), different kind of bitmap fonts, outline fonts... Now I'm mostly addicted to bitmap fonts, but thats only my personal preference. Because I dont want to deal with different charsets, encoding and stuff like that anymore - and licensing for bitmapfonts is also easilier and cheaper than for TrueTypeFonts. And its usable on every plattform that can load images. I use simply an quad in openGL and map a part of my texture on it. The other side is: The font will be only clean resizable at a factor about +/-50%. If you can live with that, I would suggest using a bitmapfont.
If you have also to deal with different encoding/charsets you should find a way to load and use TrueTypeFonts (like with freetype, using another library or with your own implemenation)...
