You can apply this to all folders by selecting all the folders in the C:\ directory and doing the Properties->Customise->"What type of folder do you want" thing. If you select "also apply this template to all subfolders", all your folders will be in that style! I have just set all of mine to "document" style. If you create a new folder in the C:\ directory, you'll have to do it again for the new folder.
I'm using Windows Vista at work (Business edition). Normally if I open Explorer in details view I see the columns Name, Date modified, Type and Size. Sometimes i'll open a folder that contains an image and the columns will instead be Name, Date taken, Tags, Size and Rating.
Windows Explorer => Organize => Folder and search options (alternatively Tools => Folder options) => View Tab => Under the Folder views click "Apply to Folder" button. 
Assuming you do that for pictures, it will use this customization for all other folders that uses folder type of pictures. You can do the same for document, video, music folders as well.
