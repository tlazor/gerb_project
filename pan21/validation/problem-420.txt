Here is a link that explains a little more about what is and isn't encrypted in day-to-day Skype conversations.
Skype doesn't specify how they apply their encryption (other than it being AES), so there is no reason to assume it is more secure than letter substitutions. Furthermore, they are known to decrypt data on their servers (no end to end encryption) if governments ask for it. 
As of right now, video and audio calls cannot be tapped by an agency. This is due to both cyber-regulations as well as the fact that Skype is P2P (peer-to-peer) when it comes to calls. Text, however, is a different story of course.
Yes and no. There always runs a risk of any sort of interception of network data - that is what encryption is for. As Eroen stated (and the last I heard), Skype uses AES which is a tried-and-tested encryption algorithm that, if implemented correctly, can take years to crack through cryptanalysis. That being said, there is always a chance of a major breach in security and your data getting compromised (in a very slim off-chance). Along with the fact that this can happen to any software transmitting data over the internet, there is usually nothing you can do to prevent this rare event from happening.
I you really need to keep something secret, you should use some peer-reviewed cryptographic software (gnupg is commonly used) with large keys encrypted with high-entropy passphrases, and make sure decrypted text or data is never stored on permanent media. 
I know that voice calls are encrypted. As for instant messages - it is rather not relevant whether they are travelling the network encrypted or unencrypted, because either way they are stored in your hard disc UNencrypted. You can even open it up in a notepad an see plaintext messages between random symbols, which probably are indicating time and other data of the messages. Not only that - Skype stores deleted messages as well.
Seeing as how this has been a hot and controversial topic worldwide, I'll speak in the general sense as well as in the context of the USA.
The fact that calls are P2P suggests this is probably how it is everywhere unless there is something intercepting that particular call data between caller A and caller B. Even more, calls are encrypted, so there is an added layer of security.
Yes - always. Any software on your computer programmed to specifically target Skype can do just that. Any means of DLL injection, hooking, etc. techniques can be applied to phish the data before it ever touches the encryption process. This, however, can be assumed for any software on your computer, not just Skype.
However, I would be far more vary of hidden microphones at my desk than of sophisticated software attacks. Also remember that common keyboards and monitors (both crt and lcd) can be wirelessly eavesdropped from several meters away with low-cost equipment.
Any software installed at either client computer can in theory listen in on your conversations, although I've never heard of this "Kaseya".
There are some programs which allow to read IM history without Skype and it is fairly easy for companies to get access to the Skype logs without your consent or additional software.
