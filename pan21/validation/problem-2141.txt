You can achieve a significant perfomance improvement by using a so-called 'dirty rectangles' approach. Instead of calculating the color-distance of every single pixel every single time, you only need to recalculate the distance of pixels that have been modified. Every step, you're eliminating two genomes, so they will have to be fully recalculated. You're also mutating another genome, which only affects a single property of a single rectangle, so you only need to recalculate pixels affected by that change. All the other genomes are unaffected, so they don't need to be recalculated at all. Some quick testing shows that this can make things up to 10x faster.
The Chromosome, Genome and Genepool classes are tightly coupled to Form1. They're also difficult to use correctly due to various implicit assumptions and a lack of protection against inconsistent state:
The anonymous object (new { score, index }) lets you use more descriptive field names than Key and Value, but otherwise serves the same purpose.
