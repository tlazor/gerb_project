Has anyone done this on Windows 8 or 8.1, using assigned access or any other method?  I've looked into using the JavaScript fullscreen API, but that requires user interaction, and the user can always cancel the fullscreen mode and get back to the address bar.
We are trying to set up a web application in a kiosk mode using Chrome in Windows 8.1.  I have been able to create an "assigned access" account (the new Windows 8.1 kiosk feature) that will log in and lock the user into Chrome.  This works quite well in that Chrome starts up when the user logs in, takes the whole screen, and the user can't access any other applications.
But this is not sufficient for us.  When Chrome is run this way the address bar is visible and the user can close tabs and open new ones using keyboard shortcuts.  We need to lock the kiosk into a single web application and not allow the user to navigate elsewhere.  The assigned access mode requires a Windows 8 Metro-style app, so I don't know of any way to supply command-line arguments to the Chrome instance.
