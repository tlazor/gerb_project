RUTE is available online, and presents a decent introduction to both Linux usage and Linux sysadmining:
Using the K&R C anaolgy, Limocelli is more a design patterns book than rather than a language reference, which is what K&R's The C Prog Lang is.
Unfortunately, some distros don't provide good docs, but you can often use the other distros' docs.  In such cases, it is good to know which distros are similar to one another.  For example, Ubuntu is derived from Debian, so the docs are almost interchangeable; and the same goes for CentOS and RHEL.
Assuming you understand the basic Unix paradigm, and wish to remain a part time sys admin and not transition over to become a full time one, i.e. you are looking for a syntax guide and some basic good practise then:
Get a Safari books online account and you'll be able to read most of the books listed in this thread.  Access to 10 books a month is $30 and unlimited books a month is $43.  Prices given were rounded and were monthly rates, there is a discount if you purchase yearly.  In addition you get about 5 tokens a month with each token allowing you to download one chapter from a book of your choosing (or on your bookshelf depending on account type) which you can then read on a device of your choosing later, or even print out on a dead tree.  Also you get access to a wide variety of programming books, so it becomes quite useful over time, and it's open at 2am when you feel a desire to look through some computer books....
I think the Limocelli's that a lot of people are recommending are great if you want to be a fulltime sysadmin, but I'm assuming by your analogies you're looking more for a syntax guide/someting you can flick through to find out what tools/facilities exist and what those tools can do. 
Essential Syatem Adminsitration is getting on and is closer to being a Data Structures and Algorthms intro book, than a K&R C type book, but is still useful for basic intro to the technical process of sys admining.
