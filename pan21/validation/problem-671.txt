Both of those answers were helpful and interesting to see the viewpoints. They helped me understand more about networking...here is what I ultimately did:  I assigned g0/38 an IP address of 192.168.100.105 and I created VLAN 50. I assigned g0/38 to access VLAN 50 and I was able to ping both the hosts that were connected to that interface. So now, when I need to ping those hosts, I just wrote a script that gets into the switch and pings it for me. Not ideal, but best case considering IP routing can't be enabled and I don't have a router that can be connected to that network.  
After setting these commands you need to add the gateway address to your devices. The VLAN interfaces we create below will be the gateways for those networks. If you already use a gateway for your current network do not add the interface vlan command for that vlan. Add another route like I did at the bottom. I'll put an example. Also, just a note, vlan 1 isn't suggested to use as a security measure. Most sites do, but I wanted to make the note. 
Backup your current config and use the following commands after your own research and your own risk. I typed all this on the fly so I may have missed something. Please backup your config before testing this.
CONFIGS BELOW ARE FOR YOUR 192.168.87.0 HOSTS a/b-e are switchport numbers so substitute them with real port numbers!
