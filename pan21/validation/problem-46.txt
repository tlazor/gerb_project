it could be a memory fault, starting up the VM guest using more memory, but if the host runs normally seems unlikely.
Have you tried the alternative installer disk? This is available from http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04-alternate-amd64.iso and uses a different installer to the default iso.
my guess is that it's a "thin" hv_vmbus driver in the guest which is breaking hyper-v, so you might be better off using the legacy network device rather than hv_netvsc for example.
try removing unnecessary virtual hardware from the guest - i.e. disk, network cards etc, and see if you can simply boot off CD. then add each device back one by one to see if it eliminates the problem.
Not that this means it should crash your Hyper-v host, but still it's something to bear in mind, I've seen some older Linux OS' cause esxi 4 to have a hissy fit for a while, never seen it cause the hypervisor to keel over though.
According to this article http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/26/ubuntu_12_04_lts/ Ubuntu have worked toward making their latest release hyper-v compatible, though microsoft haven't certified it yet, so in theory it stands a good chance.
