Currently as I said I am running Raspbian Jessie and have Kodi on top of it running 24/7.  I also have a microserver (Python3 Flask) running 24/7 that accesses/runs certain commands that I have programmed so I can remotely get it to do things when away from home (a.k.a. IoT or Internet of Things).  For example I have a Temper USB thermometer plugged in on a usb extension cord which the webserver can access to return back the room temperature.  This is all running while Kodi is on even when people are actively watching movies or streaming from the net.  I also have an NFS Client on it keeping tabs of my library of media on a File server I have, all while having multiple ssh sessions and tightvnc server running on it.
So it is bound to run horrible regardless unless you compile it yourself and find everything you need.
On another note, overclocking will heat up your ARM chip a lot faster which will then kick-off the protection algorithm when under sustained load to lower the clock speed so it doesn't burn out.  If you want to stay overclocked then you will need active cooling on the ARM chip. Check Amazon as they sell those tiny fans for the Raspberry.
So in essence, the tiny $35 Raspberry packs a hell of a punch! Compare that to an Intel NUC which orders of magnitude more expensive.
This is normal behaviour for a Raspberry Pi. Everybody wants to think of them as desktop replacements, but they are not. They pack a good deal of processing power into a small form factor for a very low price and low power usage, but a GUI will make the sluggish, Raspbian too.
My experience with Jessie was that it was a little sluggish initially.  I did get latency in all tasks to improve after I did the following.
Set a link and it was like running down a tunnel that wrapped back on itself. So far Raspbian runs very smooth and impressed with it's performance as a dev and server platform.
Slow as you state, the packages that installed were not up to our project standards we have (example mysql was impossible to remote into).
Things that I could improve but would take time and mean perhaps blowing away everything so I haven't done yet; well install Rasbian on F2FS.
However, I would seriously avoid clocking it up to boost performance on an OS that is not very compatible with it. You will be looking to replace it sooner than later.
