In general AI in games shouldn't be thought of as 'complex' it is all about getting what you want with the least possible effort. The name of the game is Emergence.
In this case, your fundamental conceptualization is wrong. These 4 systems do not need to work together at all. They just need to look like they do. They can also be a lot more stripped down than you think they need to be.
assess the state of the map. Given the knowledge the AI has (which could be everything or only what it would have if it was a player) it decides what end goal is fastest to reach. It is likely a Finite-state machine that does some number crunching and picks a goal. Possibly it is something more exotic; a Genetic Algorithm or possibly a Bayesian based doohickey. It then grunts down a message like "more science."
is unit specific. Each type of unit will react differently to the general order. A unit that is intended to suicide, may ignore a retreat order. Units that are wusses might retreat even when told to fight. Civ is typically very light on this kind of thing. Generally all the units in Civ follow their commands. Given the larger order they are under, they are (see a pattern here?) an FSM. Am I injured? I should back out and heal up. Do I have an advantage in this location? Attack. Am I too close to attack? Back off. And the complexity of this FSM need not be much more than those 3 things to be effective and convincing as intelligent.
Communication between components is more like a system of grunts and less like real communication. From high level to low level it would look like this:
Picking what units to build might be part of Strat AI or Op AI depending on how we are splitting things up.
will take the units that are available and will assign them to move into different fronts of war. It will decide the overall shape of the conflict, where new units will head once they are deployed. It is probably also an FSM. It may notice that the enemy on Front A is attacking with units weak against Unit B, and will send more Unit Bs there, rather than to the other Front which is strong against Unit B. It will issue general orders to the units at large. Attack at will. Retreat. So on.
You've also reversed the order of difficulty. The hardest component of Civ AI is the tactical AI, followed closely by the Operational. Strategic is probably very simple, and the grand AI is probably simpler still.
Now, this is all decision making AI. There are other AI subsystems at play here. There is A* or some other path-finding algorithm that lets units find the shortest path to a location. There are algorithms for finding the best location to start new cities. So on. There are often grouped with AI, and often are really more complex then the 'thinking' part of the AI. In fact, the code for finding the answers to the questions the FSM needs to ask is often orders of magnitude more complex than the FSM itself. How exactly does one decide that
then looks at what it has available to work with using much of the same information. It goes about trying to meet that overall goal, but also worries about more detailed aspects of the game. Am I at war? Do I have starving people? so on. It is probably also a Finite-state machine, possibly Fuzzy Logic (which is really just an evolution on an FSM.) Let's assume it is a simple FSM. It will ask the above questions in an order where, given certain criteria, it will decide different things need to happen this round. I'm at war, allocate monies for training soldiers. My people are starving, build a granary here rather than building something sciencey.
