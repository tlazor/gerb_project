In the end, I just gave up. I suggest buying a proper wireless router is the way to go. The pi is just not designed for this kind of task.
From my experience of trying to getting my Raspberry Pi working with a RTL8188CU based tiny wifi dongle, there are more troubles than you thought. 
The major difference here is: The power supply of pi's onboard usb is not enough, since each usb limits to 140mA on pi. While this is enough for using the pi as a "client" connecting to real wifi routers, it is usually not enough to act as one. Although one could probably put the dongle into master mode, it could be very unstable. A possible solution is to bypass the poly fuses. But I have not tried that.
Even if the power supply is enough, the linux driver for the wifi dongle is the next problem. The driver in the "official linux kernel" cannot put my dongle as a client. I had to download a driver from Realtek website (the script here is very helpful). Then a program called hostapd is needed to make it a working AP. Someone failed on that. I didn't succeed either, even on a desktop with latest arch linux.
