I had exactly the same problem, on a test system luckily. I tried all the same steps to no avail, but eventually a full restore from backup worked for me. Replication kicked in, but because the log was not yet full, I could expand the log size and allow it to grow whilst replication caught up.
Check the autogrowth setting of the log file. Make sure it is smaller than the max file size and can grow. You can use this query for that:
It sounds like you've got a huge transaction that has remained open which has done a lot of work.  Run DBCC OPENTRAN on the database and see how long the oldest transaction has been open for.  You'll probably need to kill that transaction (or have the user commit if it's someone in Management Studio).  Then the log will clear automatically.
To start with - check the values of log_reuse_wait and log_reuse_wait_desc columns in the sys.databases catalog view. You can find if anything is preventing log truncation and act based on that. You can find a list of available values and their meaning here:
My problem was compounded by a broken replication setup on our development environments that filled the transaction log and then got stuck in this endless loop of checkpoint and log full errors.
