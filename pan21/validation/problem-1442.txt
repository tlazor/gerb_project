Is anyone aware of a driver I can install in Windows to provide full read-write access to ext3 partitions, including the journal, user rights, selinux attributes (if possible, at least preserve them) and other extended attributes?
Another known workaround is to use a small coLinux installation on windows, give it full access to your linux partitions and mount them on windows using samba or NFS.
I'm using http://fs-driver.org/ for a few years. It does not provide all the features you require, but at least it does understand utf-8 file names, and I've never experienced any data corruption with it (may be I'm lucky?)
I understand that there are several alternatives for using/accessing ext2/ext3 in Windows, such as those described in a HOWTO Forge article and in a another article from a year ago.  However, none of the listed items provide full read-write access to a fully implemented ext3.  That is, the two read-write options seem to not support the ext3 journal.  (ext2fsd will replay a non-empty journal, but otherwise doesn't use it, it looks like.  ext2fs.sys doesn't seem to use the journal at all.)
Have any of you actually used one of these drivers?  Currently, I share data between OSes on a dual-boot system via a FAT32 partition.  I know that I could use NTFS, which has read-write access under Linux.  However, if it is possible, I would prefer to use ext3.
If you want to get read and write access to ext partitions from windows - have a look at paragon extfs driver for windows. It runs under all versions of Windows (8 as well) and can read any ext2/3/4 filesystem. And I donâ€™t have stability problems so far www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-windows/
