Any DNS provider worth their salt has probably already done that to some extent -- they may have given you two nameserver names and IP addresses to publish in your NS records but if they are any kind of competent DNS provider that does not mean there are exactly two servers out there and resolution of your domain will cease the minute anything happens to those two individual machines.  More likely they are using mechanisms such as dns clustering, load balancing, anycast, and/or other ways of making separate sets of many server instances look and act like two logical servers.  They should also have geographical redundancy, multiple network paths, hot spares, etc, and in short it should be very difficult to take out all of a (competent) commercial DNS provider's servers simultaneously.
There is no requirement that your primary and secondary nameservers be run by the same organization, and as Mad Hatter suggests, if you have high availability needs for your domain it's a good idea to design with redundancy in mind.
Should the worst happen and your DNS providers' nameservers all be taken out in some sort of network or other crisis, keep in mind that the first symptoms you will see will be inconsistent resolution of your domain names, as some recursive resolvers will have your information in cache and will retain it for up to TTL seconds.  During that period where your primary and secondary nameservers are unavailable, people will experience different results trying to resolve your domain depending on whether your records are cached by a nameserver upstream from them.
If you are concerned about being reliant on a single organization, however, there are many options for secondary name service (disclosure:  my non-profit employers operate one, SNS@ISC, though it is intended more to provide high-availability secondary service for organizations that are operating their own primaries, as opposed to backup for commercial DNS providers.)
