This looks promising: no redundancy and 2.5" drives would be welcome, but this is certainly a step in the right direction, at least from a portability/physical durability perspective.  And with a regular disk rotation/replacement policy (based on number of write-hours and/or elapsed time), I could see this functioning quite well:
In my head, this unit would be small, lightweight (perhaps using 2.5 in drives), rugged (with a durable tray/sled for each drive), work with standard SATAII/III drives (or possibly SAS), with a corresponding external interface.  Nice to have would be some redundancy (via RAID1 "pairs").
I know Dell makes a disk-based backup drive that uses disk "tapes", but I'd prefer something that can be recognized as a storage device in Windows, Linux, etc. and mounted accordingly.
I'm still a fan of tape.  I know it's "dying" but for capacity, longevity, and portability, it's pretty tough to beat.  However, I have some clients and prospects that have a "hate-on" for tape and want to move to disk-to-disk backups.  I've typically setup disk-to-disk-to-tape to give you that quick recovery time for "every day" restorations (like corrupt or deleted data), but the portability of tape that you can take with you off-site (and just as importantly, off-line) in case of disaster.
I've setup an e-SATA enclosure with a two-disk rotation for very small clients that couldn't afford a tape drive; I'm debating using this for a SAN-backed virtualization setup that still requires as per policy, an offline/off-site backup (even though they have a DRP "warm" location that's replicated via Veeam Backup software to an ESXi host across town), in particular the "off-line" bit to mitigate against tampering/malicious activity, etc.
If I'm reading what you're looking for right, you'd want something like this from Buffalo.  It's a 4-drive external unit that has USB and e-SATA capability with RAID functionality.  We use this in house at two of my sites, and I haven't had any problems with them.  Standard YMMV disclaimer applies.
