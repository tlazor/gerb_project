So the problem with the particles seems to be coming from the removal, as soon as I remove that piece of code it instantly works, but there shouldn't be a problem since they shouldn't even draw when their energy gets to 0 (and then they get removed)
Remove() can do a lot of work, though (it's O(n)). If you want something more efficient, do all of the removes in one step like this:
2) I might have missed it, but I didn't see the code when I had a quick look above that handled the actual "how far inside a block" test. What I'm wondering is that based off the depth inside you decide which way to push the colliding object out. You don't seem to take into consideration the velocity of the player at the time (i.e. was he moving down and is now colliding) which you could then also use to judge if he should be pushed back upwards when colliding. Instead I'm guessing you decide which direction to move the player based on which edge it's closest to of the tile. If the player is moving fast enough then you might get so far inside a tile that you think he should be pushed out the bottom.
The seccond problem is the physics problem, for some reason I can get through the right bottom corner while jumping. I think this is coming from me switching animations but I thought I made it compensate for that.
Your particle problem is because you're removing elements while looping by index. Unless you adjust the index when you remove, you'll skip over a particle the next time the loop comes around.
1) When you remove the particles, that loop is going to skip the "next" particle after one that's been removed in the loop that processes them. This is because you iterate through the list using "i", but during that loop you also remove items from the array, shifting future entries down, but then also increment "i" which then skips what was effectively the one after the one you just deleted (that's now in our slot).
I am making a game and I got some basic physics implemented. I have 2 problems, 1 with particles being drawn in the wrong place and one with going through walls while jumping in corners.
