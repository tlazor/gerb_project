You should talk with your storage vendor and see if they provide hardware based replication. It will be far faster than any other solution that you might come up with.
I am running 3 fairly big databases and replicate them over SAN both for backup (backup is done on the replica), dbcc checks and hot standby purposes. It was a nightmare to set up at the beginning but once set up works remarkably well.
It was a nightmare to set up - took us a fair amount of time. We were bounced from EMC to Dell and back. After yelling at them, they finally sent someone who actually knew what he was doing. I wanted to go with Netapp as I have a fair bit of experience with it, but was overruled by bosses. Apparently Dell offered them a better leasing deal.
I have 3 8-12 TB databases each - hosted on EMC SAN each running on a different server. We first replicate it over the same SAN, mount on a different host connected to SAN and use the replicated copy to do offline backups and DBCC checks, and batch reporting. We use replication manager for this.
