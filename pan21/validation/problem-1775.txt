Typically when you get that kind of prompt, the XP box is looking to authenticate against something and failing.  Does this network have a domain?  If so, is the OS X machine part of that domain?  
Is your Samba server configured to only accept plaintext username/passwords by any chance? Windows will refuse to do this by default, whereas Mac OS X and Linux may not.
Is the valid username part of a domain or is it a local account on the computer that is hosting that share?
The second request for valid credentials by Windows XP is either meaning the username and password you entered is incorrect or they don't have access to that share.
You say Windows is on the domain, but OSX and Samba are not; I'll take a guess you're also saying your Samba server is Linux based? Let us know what your password options are set to in smb.conf; would "security = server" be a good guess what you have running? And what is the value of your 'workgroup' line - the same as the domain?
If the above is true, check your linux server to see if 'winbind' is running - if so, turn it off as it's trying to use your domain. I have a setup similar to yours and the Windows XP guests have a problem accessing this non-domain Red Hat samba server if winbind is running, even though security = server on it. (/etc/init.d/winbind stop; chkconfig winbind off)
Based on the fact that the XP box is coming back with the name of the server, I'm guessing that the account does not exist on the server.
The login you provide must match either a domain account or an account that exists on the machine it's connecting to that has permission to that share.
For example, let's say I have a domain called, "MyDomain.local" with a server called, "MyServer".  If the account you're using exists in the domain, you'd have to type in the username like this: "MyDomain\Username".  If the account does not belong to the domain and only exists on the server, then it'd be "MyServer\Username".
