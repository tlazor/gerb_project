The first issue, assuming that IE6 was the only game in town was a reasonable assumption back in 1999-2001. Mozilla wasn't yet viable, Netscape had sucked for years and was dying and Microsoft was "it". Actually, IE is still the only game in town for big enterprises, since Mozilla still isn't (and probably will never be) viable in the enterprise and Chrome isn't quite there yet.
The latter item is IMO, a betrayal of the folks who invested serious money into Microsoft's flawed technology directions (ie. ActiveX, the crippled Microsoft JRE) of that era and is a harsh example of why locking yourself into a single vendor's technology stack is a risky proposition. 
Many organizations are looking at this from the other direction.  Absent at least one compelling reason to upgrade, they see no reason to do so. And this logic is hard to argue with. An upgrade will cost money, will trigger problems, will break things, and will be a distraction. 
Why fix what isn't broken? Particularly when there is a whole bunch of stuff that is broken, a smaller budget than last year, and a number of empty tech staff positions because of a layoff or hiring freeze.
Microsoft's discontinuance of the MS JRE forced enterprises to move to Sun Java or an alternate client solution, and the retirement of Windows XP will drive everyone away from IE6.
The root of the issue is that big enterprises made assumptions that IE was the only game in town when it came to web applications, and that Microsoft would stand by its products and support backwards compatibility. Now these companies are stuck with these big, hard to solve problems that cost alot of money to resolve.
Never had to endure it on my own machine, but certainly I've encountered this at a number of clients (typically government and large financials) where IE6 is actually just a side effect of having hardware rolled out in 5 year+ batches. Monolithics like this create massive management problems for themselves by buying and rolling out their upgrades in chunks, never at the top of the curve anyway (too expensive).
