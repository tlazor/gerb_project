Others have already mentioned reasons for mirroring (projecting via a mirror to fold the distance needed; or back-projecting), and for 180 degree rotations (set-up tablets, etc.)
Many restaurants show their menus on rotated screen (portrait mode); same for airports Departure and Arrival lists. Newer ones are simple oversize screens with 90 degree rotated display.
One can envision a circumstance in which the display mounting and associated brackets can only permit an inverted attachment of the panel. A kiosk with limited access may be one example, a display unit mounted at ceiling height with a mounting bracket that cannot be attached unless upside down.
In the case of a laptop, I can picture a situation in which the keyboard is mounted inside a box with the display extending outside the enclosure which would require to invert the image for viewing in a normal orientation.
In the past monitors could be rotated on their mounts 90 degrees each way. Haven't seen that for a long time but it was possible with some older models and I admit that this would be helpful at work in situations when I want to see many lines of code at a glance. Though I'd like to have it autorotate like in smartphones, not to have to do it manually from the OS.
