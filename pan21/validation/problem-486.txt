I have got a floating character, which should be a robot like thing, floating over the ground, whereby I am using the »hovercar« effect described here. Zhe Image below outlines the basic setup of the physics
Or even more accurate : project the speed vector on the frontmost line of the body : you now have Speed = (sx',sy'). Now apply two different coefficient, k1 and k2, for sx' and sy'. k1 would be the coefficient induced by some air coming face to the body, and k2  is the coefficient when the air comes from below the body (like 8 times smaller).
This way you'll have a realistic behavior : when going up the robot will be aligned, and the effect when going right or left will be the one you seek.
In the next image one can see how the body of the robot should be tilted when it is in motion to the right or left.
Right now, the movement of the character is implemented so that forces and impulses are applied to the chassis body. Especially if there is an Impulse to the left or right, the desired tilt of the robots body comes to happen, but it fades away when the velocity becomes more constant, or acceleration comes closer to zero.
The Green rectangle is the chassis, its not allowed to rotate and held up by the »hover-power«. Attached to this is the robots head with an revolute joint, and attached to the head is the robots body, with another revolute joint. There are some more distance Joints for damping this, but not of interest for now.
