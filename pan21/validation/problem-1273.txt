On servers, maybe, I'm not going to trust RAID controllers again, make sure you have a spare machine and good backups.
I just had the RAID controllers in two (identical) servers fail, since we got those two machines we didn't have one hard disk failure in the entire company.
Many were talking about RAID 0...that's not there to help availability. You're doubling the chances of the volume failing, since once one drive dies you lose the whole thing. RAID 0 is just about playing with speed of access to reads/writes on a volume and giving more storage. The only way this could help in a business environment is to take two RAID 0's and mirror them as RAID 1.
RAID is great for uptime, but it's not a substitute for backup. As a colleague once commented, "You know that 'Oh, sh!t' moment when you deleted something accidentally? RAID just means you get to 'Oh, sh!t' more than one drive at the same time."
That said, that day when you pop your head into your boss's office and tell her, "By the way, the database server had a hard drive crash last night-- we never went down, it finished rebuilding onto the spare at 5 AM and I've sent the bad drive off under warranty" -- that's when RAID is priceless.
I think RAID on desktop is a bad idea, the cheap RAID controllers you're going to put on those machines will fail long before the actual hard drive.
For your scientific workstations it may well be worth it IF those systems work better with their data stored locally, as opposed to a share on a file server. For the general populace however I'd say no. It's not worth the hassle and headache when all you really need is to restore data that should be kept on shares.
RAID is also not perfect. I think this post from this guy's blog kind of sums up how I feel about RAID and when it's worth it: Thinking of RAID?
On a workstation you should be able to get one person to use another system while a replacement is rolled out. Why use RAID? His or her data should be stored on the server where management, data integrity and backups are centralized. The workstation should be configured so that it can be periodically upgraded or altered as finances allow and the RAID is just another layer of cost and headache to manage (plus power use and heating issues with added drives and airflow imposition). In the majority of cases for businesses it's probably far more cost effective to put the money from a RAID card into a bigger drive, and if you're using onboard RAID then you're still going to have issues since it tends to tie the RAID format to the motherboard (and it's not true RAID anyway...it's found in Google searches as "fake raid".) Unless you get a very similar motherboard to replace one when it goes bad you may not be able to get back into your RAID volume!
For workstations RAID is probably not worth it compared to having a new system on which data can be restored...
