Power management requires either the device conform to the generic power management drivers for Bluetooth or that you have a specific driver installed from the device manufacturers. If this is for a laptop computer you should be able to take it down to any electronics retailer and ask as salesman to open the box of the one you want and pair it up with your computer to see how well it works (driver compatibility, power management, etc.).
This should fix any problems with non-responsive devices on your computer's side. Still, device itself can have some power saving features and may need time to wake up.
In my experience, Bluetooth is considerably trickier to set up than a dedicated wireless transceiver (which in most cases Just Worksâ„¢), so I would advise to buy a wireless keyboard/mouse, and only consider Bluetooth if you have an actual use case for it, like using the keyboard with your phone or tablet which doesn't have USB, or not having enough USB sockets on the laptop.
It could happen. If you have disconnection problems, try disabling bluetooth power saving options. For example in windows go to control panel->system->device manager and find your bluetooth device there. double click on it and go to power management and uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".
