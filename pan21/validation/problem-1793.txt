FCoE makes sense if you have an existing FC infrastructure and need to feed FC LUNs to your new servers and they don't have FC HBAs (or you're running out of licensed FC ports on your FC switches - that's the same). So you take 10 GbE and run FCoE to cut down the costs on FC gear. Building from scratch FCoE is pointless, run iSCSI (or SMB Direct with RDMA if you're on the "dark side") over 10 GbE and be happy. With a recent and decent multi-GHz and multi-core CPUs and both TCP and iSCSI at least partially offloaded to NIC ASICs there's no different between storage-over-TCP and storage-over-raw-Ethernet. Good luck my friend!
Due to other constraints I am using 10g on some servers (mostly - nearly all are 1g and the Netgear TXS 752 we use as backbone has 4x10g spf+) and the price factor of the network cards is - ouch. Compared to the much faster Infiniband.
So, the problem here is: I'm little confused with what I've to buy to make the network. I've saw some expensive switches, like the Cisco Nexus 5000/7000 with a lot of features but I don't know if I really need this guys.
The problem is TCP-over-IB sucks (kills performance adding huge latency) and native IB support is very limited. SMB Direct with Windows Server 2012 R2 is great (when it works).
I'm building a small datacenter from the ground, and I'm considering 10GbE. I'm looking for some advices about this decision.
Given the high prices and low bandwidth I would always prefer Infiniband to 10g. Plus a 1g based outlink - unless you have more than 1g uplink bandwidth.
Another question: iSCSI over 10GbE would be better than FCoE? (I'm considering FCoE is better because we don't use the IP stack in FCoE).
Talking about the datacenter: it will have one or two storages (two in case of failover scenario), and three 1U machines running some Hypervisor (XenServer is my favorite). The VM's will be in the storage, so the Hypervisors will boot from the storage or I will put some small SSDs in the 1U machines just to load the Hypervisor.
I've compared Infiniband, FC, 10GbE and LACP with GigE, and in the end 10GbE appears to be the best solution at this moment.
I don't have FC, so it's safe to buy single 10GbE switches without "converged networking" technologies? Or I should take one of those to get FCoE running?
