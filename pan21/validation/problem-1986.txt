Some organizations don't rely on cn at all, but use an employee id that does have a standard format that is stored in a different attribute.
I wouldn't be concerned about characters that need to be escaped. A distinguished name can have almost any character, and people that work with LDAP directories it's their job to know what characters need to be escaped.
Cn=samAccountName may seem logical, if samAccountName has a standardized format. Some organizations let people choose their username, so if someone selects 'jj89' as their username it may not produce the desired intended result.
There is also the topic of acquisitions. Depending on how an acquisition is handled, it's possible to end up with multiple directories and a meta directory, and multiple formats. Standardization of what is used for cn may not be a high priority. Or they may use the 'standard' cn format for subsequently onboarded employees so it's a bit of a mosh pit.
Something to keep in mind for large global organizations, I've seen places where women may not want to use their last name or half the men are named Muhammad, I've seen single character names like 's', or the surname is so long they abbreviate it to 'M', so the givenName/surName combination may not work as well as in western cultures.
In my experience there aren't. I've seen huge organizations (100,000+) that have adopted different formats over time and are a mess. I think some organizations use givenName surName because that is the default.
