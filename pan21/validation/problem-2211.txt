I haven't seen one.  It would have limited usefulness as Juniper, Cisco, Linksys, APC, HP Procurves, our Raritan power strips, etc all use different cables -- and some use different baud rates.
We've got a box of cables in our cage labelled with the baudrate/connection protocol and devices that it works with.
I am aware of the RJ-45 to DB9 adapter commonly used on cisco routers to access console. I am aware of the USB to DB9 adapters to allow laptops without serial to get a serial port. I am looking for a USB to RJ-45 adapter so I don't have to chain two adapters together. I have searched everywhere but even the pre-packaged solutions seem to have the two adapters chained together. Does such a thing exist? If it doesn't is there some technical reason it cannot? It seems like a manufacturer would just have to wire the DB9 end of the USB adapter differently and it would work just fine plugged straight into the console port of the router.
Yes it does. Diablo cable has 6 and 10 foot. Works natively with windows 8, no need for drivers unless you have earlier windows.
There is one here http://www.diablocable.com/diablo-cable-6ft-usb-to-rj45-rollover-console-cable-for-cisco.html as well and looking at its picture it features and in-cable electronics box which should do the trick right.
