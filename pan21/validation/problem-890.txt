For the sake of anyone finding this on Google, here is the answer provided to me by Adobe engineer Rupesh Kumar on the ticket I linked to above.
1 hour Full Gc's seem to be a feature of either Tomcat of CF10's use of it and yes I too have had issues trying to get timed Full GC's to occur; I find this last item weird as that is a JVM feature not a Tomcat feature, unless it is being suppressed somewhere within Tomcat.  I have also, found that the metrics logging setting in CF Admin does not create metrics that are very useful; nothing as they were in JRun.
Now coming to why this setting is not working now, by defaulu the RMI server would not be running in Tomcat and therefore DGC is not running. With CF 9, the inbuilt server was JRun which is stack application server that of course would have a RMI server running.
Because of its nature, DGC needs to have a frequency when GC can run so that the unused objects can get collected. Before JDK 1.6, this default interval was 60 sec and from JDK 1.6 onwards this has been increased to 1 hr by default.
Brad, in general, the JVM does not run the GC on a fixed regular interval. It is completely up to the JVM to decide when to run the full GC. In case of RMI, since the objects are exported and used by other VM, the garbage collection is distributed and hence the name dgc.
