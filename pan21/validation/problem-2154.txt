How are the disks setup in the server, I would suppose that you aren't using any RAID implementation to speed up the disk read/write speeds (as disk usage shows 33TB for the LVM group) and this is your problem. 
Look into getting a server with a quality RAID card and setup your disks in RAID6 if you're going with high number of disks per server, this way you'd get better speed and redundancy if you have a disk failure, since RAID6 can withstand two failed HDDs, where other RAID configuration can withstand 1 failed disk. 
If you have 12 x 3TB drives and placing them into RAID 6 configuration, the formula to calulate the disk space you'd have is (N â€“ 2) x (Smallest HDD size) , so on 12 3TB disks you would have 30TB of free disk space:
Also another suggestion, if you would be using this server just to serve files, I would suggest a switch to nginx that would prove itself beneficial in resource usage and the performance you would get out of it compared to Apache server which is good to a certain level. But this depends on your systems setup.
As previous answers are correct, the 'wa' stands for disk I/O wait which is extremely high, practically locking up your server and placing any process that depends on disk I/O into uninterrupted sleep state (processes marked as "D" in top) - the problem is that you can not clear these processes by sending SIGKILL signal to them, they will not respond until they get what they wanted from the disk, and then they will exit. 
With the RAID setup you would be sacrificing a bit of disk space but you would get better read/write speeds compared to the current setup. 
Processes in D state can be cleared either by reducing your disk I/O wait which will clear the processes or reboot the server, and rebooting is the last thing you want to do, if you run into a need for a filesystem check (fsck) it would take a long time to go trough 33TB of data on slow disks, it even takes too long on RAID setups.
Also when you have the new server setup, look into RAID array health monitoring, einarc would be helpful to determine the RAID array and display if there are any problems with your RAID array.
