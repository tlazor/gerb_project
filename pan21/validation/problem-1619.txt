Here's mine (I believe it was written years ago by Oscar, the sysadmin of my old lab, all credit to him), its been around in my bashrc for ages. It has the added benefit of allowing you to prepend or append the new directory as desired:
For prepending, I like @Russell's solution, but there's a small bug: if you try to prepend something like "/bin" to a path of "/sbin:/usr/bin:/var/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin" it replaces "/bin:" 3 times (when it didn't really match at all). Combining a fix for that with the appending solution from @gordon-davisson, I get this:
My versions are less careful about empty paths and insisting on paths being valid and directories than some posted here, but I do find a large-ish collection of prepend/append/clean/unique-ify/etc. shell functions to be useful for path manipulation. The whole lot, in their current state, are here: http://pastebin.com/xS9sgQsX
Of course, these entries could still be duplicated if added by another script, such as /etc/profile.
