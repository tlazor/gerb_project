I can recommend a commercial one called FocalScope. It comes with a lot of features and a great interface to help you speed up your customer support and enhance your businessâ€™ inner communication. Our customers contact a support department and internally we route it to available agents automatically, using the ticket queue and based on the type of query. There also has an archiving routine built in and management is easy since it is installed on one server or in the cloud.
PHP web-based project management framework that includes modules for companies, projects, tasks (with Gantt charts), forums, files, calendar, contacts, tickets/helpdesk, multi-language support, user/module permissions and themes 
This is a simple, to-the-point system. It was born out of loathing of the system that I was forced to use. It was tested in a live environment with hundreds of users and ultimately de-throned our expensive and bloated ticketing software. 
Now, I'm providing support to clients externally, so we have recently migrated to Zendesk and we think it's brilliant, it's simple, easy, it's growing and improving constantly and the best part is that it's cheap! 
When I was working in a company supporting users, we used spiceworks, which is a great free application and provides you with a lot of tools to view a snapshot of your network. 
I can recommend eSupport. I our company we have good experience with this commercial product. With a lot of ajax support. Gives a good user experience.
