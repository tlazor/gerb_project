Take ESXi out of the equation and follow standard troubleshooting steps. Since ESXi uses bridged networking, it presents the guests to the network as if they were physical nodes connected to another switch on yout network. 
If it works one way, then they are connected - full stop. Perhaps you have the firewall turned on, in the guests?
I'd guess that ICMP Echo isn't allowed through the guest firewalls, or that there is a hardware firewall between the guests and the physical clients that is blocking ICMP.
I have 2 windows 7 virtual machines on an ESXi host I set up, and I want to get them so that they are accessible on my LAN that I have set up. I read the documentation and it said the virtual network adapters are automatically connected to the physical ones on my host. So I tried to ping both my virtual machines from a physical computer I have on my network, but it says "Request Timed Out." I can, however, ping that physical computer from within my virtual machines. So I was just curious, how can I get them to communicate both ways???
Is the firewall enabled on the guest system?  Are the guests on the same subnet as the host?  Do you have  the network adapter set as Bridged or NAT?
