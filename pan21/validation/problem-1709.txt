Computer manufacturers have done a horrible job (in most cases) because they completely fail to provide you an obvious way to restore your computer.  In theory, you should be creating a backup immediately upon startup.  Windows 7 backups are full images and can restore your computer to the state you had it when you created the backup.  Some system vendors MAY provide a utility to create recovery media (more popular with XP, haven't noticed it much if at all on Win7).
You can also contact Microsoft, and they'll probably be willing to help you figure out your options, since you're a legit customer and their install/activation support is free.
You may want to contact your laptop manufacturer to get one with the drivers preloaded.  They'll probably charge you $30-50 for it.
If your Windows install key/license is legit you can use any compatible media to reinstall however you'd like.
Unless you have deleted the system image, it WILL get you back to factory default settings. If your school is under MSDNAA, you can download an image from the MSDNAA website. Otherwise, contacting the manufacturer to get a windows disk is always an option.
As stated in a previous answer, contact the manufacturer.  As this is an OEM installation, it is up to the Original Equipment Manufacturer to provide you with a recovery option - media or some other option.  Microsoft as a general rule will not provide you with replacement media for OEM licenses and will simply refer you to the manufacturer anyway.
