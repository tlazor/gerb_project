It's not a "step-by-step" reference, but I strongly advise you to read Publishing Concepts in ISA Server 2006 from Microsoft TechNet. You really need to understand how ISA's "Publishing" model works to make it do what you want. Once you understand how it works, you won't need a "step-by-step" guide because it will "just make sense".
The computer that ISA Server is installed onto does not have to be a member of an Active Directory domain. Computers hosting services that are "published" through ISA Server (like web sites) also do not have to be members of an Active Directory domain (or, indeed, even running Windows-- you can "publish" a Linux-based web server just fine, for example).
I want to use ISA Server 2006's web publish feature to publish my internal IIS server web site (http://testorder) to a part of my external web site (http://www.mycorp.com/testorder), and currently, I met with 2 issues during my planning phase,
These ISA Server Virtual Labs may help you, too, since they guide you through some basic ISA server administration tasks.
