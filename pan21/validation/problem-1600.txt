Does anyone know of any software/hardware configuration that will allow you to preview/view the contents multiple monitors on one monitor? Let's pretend: 
Would it work to install VNC servers (essentially remote desktop) on all of the machines whose monitors you want to view, then run several instances of a VNC client on the monitoring computer? You might want to check out software like VNC Thumbnail Viewer (I've never used it, but it looks nifty) which shows a thumbnail of each machine you have VNC running on, then you can click to enlarge the image.
However, wouldn't it be possible to capture display data generated by the OS kernel or data getting passed down to the display adapter driver? 
My hacky solution - change monitor A to one with PIP (picture-in-picture) and then get a Y-shaped video lead. No idea if such a thing exists or not.
I haven't been able to find much about this, but I imagine it may not currently be possible to access/emulate video output going out of a video port in software. 
If not, a port replicator style thing as is often used in electronics stores to demonstrate computer monitors should do it.
One solution that accomplishes this task is to run a VNC server on the pc with multiple monitors, then connect to that pc using a VNC Client(that connects to the VNC server running on localhost) on the same pc.
