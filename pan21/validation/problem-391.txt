Another option would be if you have corporate antivirus/spyware software, check to see if yours supports blocking of programs.  Many of them have the ability to block common games built in.
Our company wishes to block all online mmorpg and other such games. I really don't want to block ports as sometimes some of the ports are used by our programmers testing our those ports. Our company uses a Draytek 2820 modem and it can block ip ranges too.
Where can I find such a list? And if simply using IP's is a bad idea what is the best way to block MMORPG's?
You mentioned that these are programmers and that ports needed to be opened for testing by them, so the chances are that they need full (administrator) access to their machines to do the development. Hence a technical solution is probably not possible by locking down the PCs.
However, it sounds like you are trying to solve the wrong problem.  The problem isnt preventing people from playing games, its that they have the ability to play games on their work computers.  The PCs should be locked down preventing them from installing the games in the first place.
Also there are so many games sites that you probably can't block all of them and, if they are decent programmers and really want to play, they can just set up a proxy relay on another machine anyway. You'v already said that port blocking isn't viable.
Of course, if they are exceeding targets/deadlines then letting them have a bit of free time to play shouldn't be a problem.
