The solution for us to meet our RTO/RPO SLA was to install a Riverbed WAN Optimization Appliance between the 2 sites.
Does EQL support continuous async replication or is driven by a snapshot schedule? Can you use the whole 3Mb 24/7?
3Mb/s is probably not going to cut the mustard unless you use WAN acceleration (such as Riverbed, mentioned by one of the other answerers). WAN acceleration works by keeping a cache on disk at both sides of the link where they store all the most recent data you've sent, and if you ever send a duplicate block, it sends a reference instead of the data. 
I am currently in the process of something similar however with Solaris 11 and zfs as our san backend. Because of bandwidth I decided to separate out most of the components. We migrated to exchange 2010 so that we can set up our dr site with an identical copy. What I found was doing san level snapshots would be ridiculous for this data because of bandwidth issues like you are seeing. We decided it would be cheaper and more efficient to set up a dag and replicate within exchange itself. We also did the same thing with our mysql servers. What we clone now are systems with less deltas between snapshots. I was able to do the initial synchronization at the office and transport it to its final destination. 
The block size is 16 Mo for snapshot and replication on Equallogic SANs. This is why you got those astronomical numbers. No way to change that.
For the sake of focusing on the most relevant information, I'd suggest defining an objective for your recovery point and recovery time. These are unimaginatively referred to as an "RPO" and "RTO". Disk replication is supposed to reduce them both by keeping a crash-consistent copy of the data that's never older than a few minutes on another site.Once you have these numbers, you can define things like how often you have to have a crash consistent replica.
If your VMs do not have their page files on a separate datastore, you should try moving them to one and then re-measuring your rate of data change (data churn). This will definitely help.  Don't replicate more than you need to. 
As for the data itself, I agree with the replies that suggest not replicating the swap files. Swap files can take a lot of disk and are always changing, which would trigger a lot of replication traffic. I don't know whether VMWare supports replication of an environment without them, though... I assume that the VMs in a a VM datastore replicated without swap files would be crash-consistent, however I can't confirm that myself. 
That said, assuming your storage is using the same engine to take snapshots as it uses to replicate snapshots, then the most accurate measure of change is indeed a snapshot reserve. You'd need to keep one snapshot and its reserve isolated for the duration of the the measurement period, though. Assuming EqualLogic uses copy on write snapshots, comparing data from the reserve of several snapshots taken throughout the day might actually make it seem like your data's changing more than it actually is.
