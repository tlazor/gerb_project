It's quite simple: If you do not hold copyright to a work, you are not allowed to reproduce it. Since using it in class would be reproduction, you are not allowed to do it under US copyright law.
The one exception is "fair use" (well, there are others, but if they applied you'd probably know about it). It is very clearly defined and there is a plethora of court cases covering specific instances. You should peruse this information and decide for yourself (better yet, ask a lawyer) whether your work is fair use or not. We cannot decide for you, and even if we wanted to, we are not supposed to give legal advice on this site.
That said, your case does not sound like fair use. Speaking very broadly, fair use exists so that you can't abuse copyright to stop people from talking about your work - it is not a magic loophole that lets you ignore copyright whenever you want simply because you are doing it for "educational purposes". Yes, copyright holders can prevent you from using their work, even if you are not deriving any income - perhaps they are worried you will hurt their image, or that you will cause them to lose the copyright, or they think they can force you to pay for it - the reason is irrelevant, the point is that the law gives them the right. If this was not the case, every infringer would start claiming they are somehow doing it for educational purposes and completely sidestep the spirit of copyright law (in fact, back in the day software pirates used to claim their cracks were for "educational purposes only" - I don't believe that worked too well, since the practice hasn't persisted, while the lawsuits have).
