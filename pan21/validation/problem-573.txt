Do any Windows logs give you any direction what is happening when it freezes? Review all firmware and driver versions for known/similar issues (especially graphics, controllers, chipset, etc.). If it suddenly started, check to see what changed around this date such as a Windows update, resource utilization, hardware configuration, or new functionality. During off-peak hours when you can do a reboot, try some prodding such as restarting services (you can connect to the server remotely with the Services console). You are looking for RPC errors or timeouts that may suggest Operating System level problems or other. This is a generic problem/description so if nothing else these will help tell you what is NOT the problem.
I have a redundant set of AD servers that periodically do the same. Those are (luckily) the only Windows servers we run. What happens is that the user.ini file gets corrupted, particularly on a lengthy Windows update session. The only thing that helps is (since of course it does not find its recovery partition, and a command line does not help) to take the OS disk out, put it on a USB-to-SATA adapter, connect it to any willing PC, and manually go through the directories in the \user folder and delete everything with the extension .ini. Pop the disk back into the server, boot it up, and restore all of the users' desktop and such, for all users (in our case there is only one user, and that is admin) since these servers really only need to run AD. Terrible software design.
