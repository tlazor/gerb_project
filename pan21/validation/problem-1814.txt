In your case though, you are trying to boot from a CD or DVD which really should be invoked prior to Windows 7 having anything to say.
This is very odd though as the BIOS settings override any OS settings. Windows 7 is not even loaded at the point where the BIOS selects from which medium to load the desired OS from.
Have you tried booting using a USB-based storage device ? You can take almost any .ISO file and set it to make a USB device bootable with it. UNETBOOTIN, which can run under both Windows and Linux can take a .ISO file of any Linux distribution and make your USB storage device bootable with this ISO file, just as if you were booting off a CDROM. If you cannot boot off a CDROM, this may be an alternative solution.
I suggest you edit the BIOS setting and simply set CD/DVD as the first and only boot option. Then disable the rest (2nd,3rd,4th, etc) boot options. That setting will work fine as a HD is really not required for the system to boot (from a CD/DVD).
You can have the First Boot Device CDROM but then have two CDROMs under the boot menu and it's choosing your bluray instead of your DVDRW or however you may have it set up.  Unplugging it was probably what brought the correct one to the top.
When you have more then one hard drive, cdrom, etc you only get so many choices to boot from even if you select them properly in the linked image.  Make sure the drive you want to boot from is on the top when in the cdrom/hard drive menu.  
I do understand that (all?) Windows versions have always destroyed any bootloader e.g. LILO or GRUB and replaced it with its own. In this case I always installed first Windows and then another OS if needed.
