You can’t be 100% sure you’ve listed all sql servers on the network unless all are configured to work on default 1434 port. Otherwise this would turn out to be a complex task that would require scanning all non-standard ports on all servers.
You can also download Discovery wizard tool from Quest and see if you can use it in trial mode to get the job done.  
The Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP) Toolkit is a Microsoft product that's specifically designed to perform discovery and help identify licensable servers.
If you want to programmatically find this information, you can make a call to the SqlDataSourceEnumerator.GetDataSources Method:
Also, look at Generate a SQL Server Instance Inventory. It has all tools available for scanning sql servers on network.
If you loop through all your servers and grab all services that start with "MSSQL" you'll have a rudimentary list to start with.  You may have to manually filter that down though.
There's a decent webcast available showing some of the canned reports, which look like they might serve your purposes.
Another thing you could consider is to reach out across all of your servers (again, very time consuming) and get all services that contain a known SQL Server string in their name.
