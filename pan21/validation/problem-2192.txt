Mac Mini appears to only have an HDMI input on the back.  It says it comes with a DVI to HDMI converter.  However, when going through the purchase process they give you the option to buy a mini dv to DVI adapter.
The Mini DisplayPort to DVI adaptor listed in the optional add-ons would only be necessary if you wanted to connect two DVI monitors. The HDMI to DVI adapter included for free works fine, so unless you're planning to use two displays, you don't need a DisplayPort to DVI adapter. 
Also double check that the KVM supports the video resolutions that you wish to use.  Some KVMs dont support really high resolutions, or resolutions that have non-typical aspect ratios.
The DVI adapter included with the Mac Mini would work fine. There's no need to buy any additional adapters. Just make sure to get a KVM that supports DVI and supports the maximum resolution of your monitor, and you'll be fine.
HDMI and DVI are 100% compatible, so an HDMI to DVI adapter will work better anyways. DisplayPort and DVI are different electronically. Adapters therefore have a higher chance of being slightly finicky.
