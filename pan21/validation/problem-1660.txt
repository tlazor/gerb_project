As of Chrome 58 it no longer accepts self-signed certs that rely on Common Name: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/zVo3M8CgKzQ;context-place=topicsearchin/chrome/category$3ACanary%7Csort:relevance%7Cspell:false
I followed the steps on the above mentioned Heroku article to generate the key. I then wrote a new OpenSSL config file:
Instead it requires using Subject Alt Name. I have been previously following this guide on how to generate a self-signed cert: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self which worked great because I required the server.crt and server.key files for what I'm doing. I now need to generate new certs that include the SAN however all of my attempts to do so have not worked with Chrome 58.
With the exception of the config file to set the SAN value these were similar steps I used in prior versions of Chrome to generate and trust the self-signed cert.
I'm on a Mac, so I opened the server.crt file with Keychain, added it to my System Certificates. I then set it to Always Trust.
In Windows, save this script in your SSL folder as makeCERT.bat.  It will create these files:  example.cnf, example.crt, example.key
