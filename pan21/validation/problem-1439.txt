Configure Local Area Connection in the VLAN section to create a new LAN interface that is tagged for the VLAN I want. Repeat processor for all tagged, and untagged ID. 
Does anyone know if there is a better way to do this or some way of making it so I don't have to keep deleting and recreating the VLANs? The biggest issue is one of time - creating each VLAN takes about 1-2 minutes. So by the time I have my computer set up, I have already spent 10 minutes just making it so I can connect to devices. Deleting the VLANs takes about 3 minutes a piece (really, I go grab coffee if I have to do delete). Untagging a few ports, and using them as VLAN management has worked, but the network switch is difficult to access...
I am trying to manage different pieces of equipment, on a contained network, which is seperated into a few VLANs (VID: 1 - Management, 2 - Auto-Voip, 50 - Control - 51 - Dante). Some of the software I use requires me to select the network interface I would like to search on (Specific software: Riedel AVB tool, Audinate Dante controller, Netgear SmartSwitch, etc). 
Connect laptop to the switch port that I have configured as a trunk for managing all VLAN's devices. 
I found on the web that Dante does not support VLAN tagging. As a consequence the Dante Controller software ignores the VLAN tagged Ethernet adapters that I created on my PC. I guess it enumerates only physical interfaces and when it sees that the physical Ethernet adapter that supports my VLAN has a number of network protocols disabled (a consequence of having it support virtual adapter which expose those particular protocols enabled), it ignores this adapter.
