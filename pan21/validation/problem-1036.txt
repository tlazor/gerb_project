There's a lovely computed attribute you can query for each user called msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed.  You can use the native Active Directory powershell modules to query it with the Get-ADUser command like this:
A nice hack would be just to change it to more than the number of days that any user existed, this would give you all the users and their expiration dates. Example:
For 2003/2008 use Quest PowerShell AD modules from http://www.quest.com/powershell/activeroles-server.aspx
Now you may notice that some of your users don't have anything listed in the PassExpiry column. That's most likely because their passwords are configured to never expire and that FileTime value converted to a DateTime exceeds the maximum value for a DateTime and the conversion failed.  If you're doing calculations on or sorting these expiry values, it's usually helpful to not have empty values in your results. So we can add a bit more conditional logic to our customized select statement and just set those values to DateTime.MaxValue.
However, the attribute is returned as a FileTime value which isn't very human friendly. So we add some formatting to our output to convert the value into an actual DateTime object like this.
