Now, a more practical solution: consider using what's known as a "SSHD", provides a small SSD cache with HDD backed storage. They can be found at the required capacities for much cheaper than a pure SSD; at the time of writing, they're under 60 USD, e.g. a 500 GB Seagate SSHD or a 1 TB WD SSHD. They cache the most frequently accessed data on the built-in SSD portion, which should provide most of the speed boost you're looking for.
I would like to load an Xbox One game onto a flash drive (SSD performance is much faster than HDD.)  The game is ~ 6GB, and the flash drive i'd like to utilize is 32GB.  However, Xbox requires that drives capable of loading games meet the following requirements:
Firstly, I'll answer the direct question: there is no way to safely spoof free space and doing so will basically guarantee data corruption. Modern file systems like to write data all over the drive, and will not fill it from start to end.
The other issue with using flash drives is they're largely designed for storage at minimal cost. The cheaper ones struggle to reach 20 MB/s (I've seen many under 10 MB/s) sequential speeds, far below a HDD's typical 100-200 MB/s. The better ones claim up to 150 MB/s, but even that's only in best-case sequential read - the write speeds tend to hover around 20-30 MB/s (not so relevant to gameplay but it will slow down any updates.
Then there's the random speed. Since they are generally optimised for bulk data transfer, their random access speeds aren't much good. They'll be better than a HDD, to be sure, but still fall far behind a full SSD. Flash drives tend to use cheaper NAND than SSDs, and also have lower-performance controllers, so you cannot assume they will provide SSD-like performance.
