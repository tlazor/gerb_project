That is because there is no "right" answer.  Each network has different requirements, so the answer will depend on several factors that vary from network to network.  What is right for my network may not be for yours.
For that reason, I can't answer your last question (besides it's not clear what your topology is).  I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.  Remember that routers communicate with each other, so it isn't necessary to have "failover" pairs, because the routing protocols cam make adjustments if a device fails (that's an advantage over ASAs).   Switches and ASA (without routing) don't have that feature, so they have failover, stacking, or other features to add redundancy.
The place where the two options tend to run together are VPN's - and, honestly, cases can be made for either device depending on the context.  User access VPN's are almost always better served by firewalls nowadays but most of the really heavy site-to-site work (..especially over public MPLS) seem to be performed by routers.  Even so, there are plenty of valid counterexamples to both of my generalizations.
Yes, for small networks with few features, you can pretty much use one r the other.  But many networks need more advanced routing features that ASAs don't have, and they need more security performance or features that a router can easily deliver.  That is why you use one or the other.
Firewalls are really, really good at security functions.  Some routers have firewall functionality but, ultimately, such features tend to be add-ons intended for small installations.  Full stateful analysis?  Firewalls.  Add in IDS/IPS?  Firewalls (well, some of them).  Lots of app-level analytics to intelligently filter traffic based on user identity, app heuristics, etc?  Firewall.  Hopefully you get the idea.
So - for example - one can buy a 36-port 100GE switch for less than a mid-range firewall.  Such a switch will be able to move more packets in less time than racks full of high-end firewalls.  At the same time, though, the switch will only be capable of enforcing a relatively small number of stateless rules (in the form of ACL's).
So... Routers can also provide firewalling and firewalls can do limited amounts of routing.  They both have their place and part of the value of experienced architects and engineers is understanding both where the pieces could fit and where they ought to fit.
Similarly there are a whole bunch of things that routers do really well that firewalls frankly don't.  If you're trying to home to multiple ISP's with BGP and want to gracefully and sanely control policy, buy a router/switch.  If you want to build out a user access environment with dozens of downstream devices?  Router/switch.  Fancy QoS?  Router.  Lots of port density?  Switch.  
It's hard to completely generalize any of the above.  Particularly toward the higher end of the spectrum routers will move massively more data than any firewall.  That said, as the speed of the router increases the sophistication and completeness of security features will tend to decrease.  
Generally, speaking, ASA have better performance for security features such as stateful inspection, packet inspection, logging, etc than routers.  Routers have more routing features, and the routing protocols are a bit more mature (fewer bugs) than ASAs.  Routers come in all sizes, from home office to carrier grade, so you can have any performance you can afford.
