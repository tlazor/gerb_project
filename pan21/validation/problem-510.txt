His conclusion is as you suggested (dimensionality), semantics, cultural concepts of justice, as well as non-binary data types (e.g. confessed but with what constraints and conditions?) will not lead to satisfying mathematical results, when it comes to the actual range of sentences. 
A friend (Law and CS graduate) recently wrote his PhD dissertation about the use of AI and ML approaches in law. 
Welcome to the site and thanks for the great question! I recently led an NLP project that dealt with a lot of laws. While I have to obfuscate my actual work, here's a general view:
NLP is very widely used in certain aspects of Law. I worked on few use cases related to Contract Management. While I can't talk about specifics, general areas where NLP is applied are :
Law (judiciary) contains such a huge corpus to apply NLP to, but yet there are only search engines designed for Law. Why is NLP not yet extensively applied? Is it because of dimensionality? 
However, NLP can help preprocessing cases to better distribute them to the person in charge of. In categorical cases (e.g. traffic delinquency) one can use NLP approaches to make the whole process more efficient.
