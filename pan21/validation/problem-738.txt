Windows 7 and Vista use a new format for user profiles. It's not your server being incompatible, it's Vista and Win7 being incompatible with 2000/XP profiles.
Windows XP profiles are not compatible with Vista/W7 profiles out of the box.  Microsoft has a whitepaper Managing Roaming User Data Deployment Guide which includes a section called 'Windows Vista and Windows XP Roaming User Profile Interoperability'.  This document contains the details you need to get as much compatibility as possible on Vista, I believe most of the directions should be the same for Windows 7.
Check your roaming profile directory, and you'll notice that you'll have a .V2 folder there (thats your Win7/Vista profile).
When I bring my home-computer to work and log into the network with domain\username it logs me in just fine.
What you probably want is essentially two sets of settings, one for XP and one for Vista/W7, that redirect all things you want shared to "common" areas. Or are you sure this is a one way think and you won't need changes you make here to go back to your "old" XP profile?
Although, approving my profile, letting me into the network, including all network drives and printers, it does not download the profile fully. I do believe it might be getting the roaming profiles.
