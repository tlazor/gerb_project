The iso9660 standard covers the cdrom specs and since partitions are not part of the specs nobody ever wrote a driver to handle them.  No existing driver would support your changes to the file system, and all the programmers I know would not violated the specification.
The original thinking was probably who would want to partition such a tiny amount of space.  They probably look at how much work it would take to develop,write, and test the code and said too much work to meet what ever deadlines they had.
Changing the driver now would not only mean adding a sector in the being, but changing the whole code base to accommodate the logic behind partitions.  Lets pretend you wrote such a driver and made ISO's like that, they nobody else could read the ISO of the CD since everyone else has drivers that follow the specs.  By the time you submitted your changes to ISO standards committee, got them to look at and go through the whole approval process would take years.  However, they would probably not approve it since all modern hardware is design around the original specs.
