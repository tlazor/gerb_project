You mentioned that vhds are already on a separate drive, could you check whether the snapshots (if used) might reside on C:? These might grow quite large.
I have stood up a 2008 R2 Server running only a Hyper-V role. The *.vhd files are stored on a separate partition. The files (including hidden files) within the C:\ drive consume about 12 GB of disk space. Yet, when I check the local disk, C:\, it says that I am using 73.4 GB of space. This was not the case before I configured the box to run the Hyper-V role. 
Did you count system files? Usually pagefile.sys grows to be at least the same size as the amount of RAM installed.
You probably have the "Automatic Stop Action" for your VMs set to "Save the virtual machine state."  When you have this chosen (and it's the default) then enough space is reserved for the VM's RAM so that you definitely can save it when the host machine shuts down or reboots.  And, by default, the local for these files is with the VM configs on the c:.
For any guest OS for which you have the Integration Components installed, it's usually more appropriate to choose "Shut down the guest operating system" as the automatic stop option.  At that point, your disk space will be reclaimed.
The goal here is to make sure we do not run out of space on the system drive as we anticipate adding 4-6 virtual machines in the immediate future.
