I came across similar problem, and it turns out, AWS EC2 defaults differ for launching instance vs. creating an AMI: hardware virtualization (HVM) is the default choice in first case, but paravirtual (PV) is the default for image creation. 
I had the same thing happen, and choosing the correct AKI for the OS version and architecture using the tool above worked like a charm.
I stumbled upon this when tried to move EC2 instance between availability zones by snapshotting its EBS volume and creating a new AMI, and this discrepancy in settings (which I did not pay attention too) wasted an hour for me.
This seems to indicate to me it is using the snapshot as the root volume for the new instance (it is, in fact, the only volume).
I have an EC2 instance running the Ubuntu 12.04 32bit AMI (available in the first page the Classic wizard for launching a new instance).  The root device is an EBS volume.  I then follow these steps:
I then launch the instance.  However, it fails the "status checks" during the "initialization" step.  If I right click the instance and "Get System Log", this is the tail of the log:
