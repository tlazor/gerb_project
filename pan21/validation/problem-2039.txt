I have my current website on shared hosting. But recently we are shifting to VPS hosting. I am quiet new to this term and when I talked with their sales team about what is VPS and can I remotely connect to my machine using mstsc. They said the plan that I chose doesn't have that feature and for my budget, they can offer Linux VPS. Now the thing that confuses is how do I copy my existing website and move it there if they don't have any GUI? Do I have to type Linux commands for that?
However, if you've never done it before, you might want to hire someone to administer your VPS or purchase a managed VPS, which is more costly than a non-managed VPS...
HowtoForge has a ton of tutorials that will answer your questions. But as long as you are willing to learn and working in a terminal, you can learn system administration.
Secondly, how do I open XML files and edit them. I know this sounds like a noob question but normally I am used to do mstsc for remote login. Can anybody explain me basic things of VPS and how do I get more help. I don't even know how to open a text or xml file in VPS.
