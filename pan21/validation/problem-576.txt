It's quite easy to do this if you have a hdd box . You ghost that image to your desktop hdd . It's done .
Another handy option, although it might be only on higher end products, is the universal restore which allows the image to be restored onto dis-similar hardware and drivers specified and added at image restoration time.
I'd personally reccomend Acronis Home Edition. ou can take a base image of the Laptop and store it either on another computer on the network, on Physical Media such as a removable HDD or DVD's, or on a seperate protected partition on the Laptops HDD. There is also the option to install recovery manager on the pc so the user can just press F11 at boot to restore the image. If the image is on the HDD then this re-imaging can be done anywhere in only minutes. 
Another way is : You can create an boot usb . After that, you can use this one to ghost :) It's the most and easy way you can do :) ( USB is easy to find , right? )
I've used this product for a few years now, as well as the enterprise versions, and have had only positive experiences, even when moving servers from box to box for testing and migration.
