if the missile has been thrusting at 90 degrees to it's line of motion for 360 degrees of movement you are in orbit.  Adjust the thrust to 120 degrees from the line of motion.  The missile's orbit will widen as it's not turning as hard but the missile will also slow, thus allowing it to maneuver better.  When the range to target opens to 1.25x the diameter of the dead zone (note that this diameter is based simply and only on the missile's speed, no complex calculation is required at runtime) the missile returns to it's normal tracking behavior.
As has been said you should aim the missile for where the target is expected to be when you get there rather than for where the target is right now.  This will stop MOST missiles from going into orbit but an orbit is still possible if the target evades just right.  This is a legitimate tactic used by aircraft pilots to dodge incoming missiles--since the missile is going much faster than you it will have a larger turning radius and a sharp jink at the right instant causes it to go on by.  (Although you could still be at risk from a proximity detonation.)
However, I disagree with his solution to the problem.  Instead, I would program the missiles thusly:
Since we are dealing with a missile that can still track and still has thrust you get an orbit situation if the target evades into one of the zones that FxIII's post talks about.
