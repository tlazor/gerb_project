Since I cannot accept "no solution" answers concernig this problem, I developed an outlook addin which makes it possible to configure this and solve this problem for now. Its not completely finished yet but I'll put the source in a git repository as soon as im finished. I'll post the link down below.
The commertial account name@domain1.com now requires that the outgoing mails are signed with a S/MIME certificate. 
I've been trying this problem for quite some time now. I even contacted microsoft support to check if they have any information on how to solve this. So their and my answer after investing an almost stupid amount of time is: There is no solution for this currently!
One option would be to untick "add digital signature to outgoing mails" in the trusting center but then the signing-option is turned off for the signed account. Ticking it for every mail manually is very unhandy...
So is there a way to set up outlook to ignore the signature for the two unsigned accounts or to tick the signing for outgoing mail from one single account by default?
The problem now is that the other two accounts name@hotmail.com and name@domain2.com dont need to be signed. Since I ticked the option "add digital signature to outgoing mails" in the trust center, outlook thinks I want to add a digital signature to every mail of every account. So it pops up a prompt everytime I want to send a mail from one of those two unsigned accounts. Setting it up to send it unsigned will send the mail, altough it wil promt it again the next time.
So I set up a certificate from COMODO, imported that into the trust center in outlook and everything seems to work fine.
