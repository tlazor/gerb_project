If I understand this correctly, you want to access the OOB Management interface on a server from a remote location - is that correct?
And, last but not least, if the policy forbidds the use of site-to-site VPN: You don't have to care because what you want is client-to-site VPN ;)
As far as I understand the background of your question, you have 3 options to accomplish what you want:
I do this at a lot of clients sites, and I generally setup a VPN to their network router and then connect to the OOB management via that VPN (either production or management VLAN dependent on their setup). If the server OS is down, I can still get access.
On one occasion, I had a client where their OOB interface was NATd to a public IP address, and so could be accessed directly from anywhere subject to firewall rules. Not the ideal setup, but it was what they wanted.
The idea is to allow remote support of a server system (access to its oob interface and os) even though the systems operating system is unable to boot correctly and setup the VPN connection by itself.
I am looking for a PCI or PCI Express based Network card with builtin VPN possibilities or a network card which allows to flash its firmware vyatta, ipcop , routeros or any similar os.
