A server with address beginning with 127.127.1. is the Undisciplined Local Clock. Its use is not recommended, it does not add anything, confuses people, and orphan mode is better. 
For some of them, like driftfile, I figured out they need to be over-written. I am not sure of the ones that remain. Are they needed or do I replace them? If I keep them, does order matter?
You don't need to use the NIST Internet time service to get a reliable clock. You can if you wish, and they appreciate using the time.nist.gov global load balancer. However, the NTP Pool Project takes load off of reference clocks, and performs adequately for many use cases.
Otherwise all the left out settings are not needed, they are statistics features that are not needed for normal operation.
If you have a complete set of directives you want to set, just replace the distro's ntp.conf. But you don't need to as they have equivalent security:
Based on my understanding, these are the settings I know need to be there based on merging the default options and what I was provided:
To add further to John Mahowald's answer: the recommended configuration you were given is old and shouldn't be followed.  The default configuration supplied by Debian/Ubuntu is designed to be as secure as possible given the NTP vulnerabilities we know about to date, and you should make the minimal changes to it possible.
The only thing in the proposed configuration which might be significant to you is the selection of NIST's time servers.  If you want to use them, you should use the pool directive rather than just server.  The pool directive enables ntpd to stop using servers if they are unresponsive or serving bad time, so you should nearly always use it in preference to server.
The content of driftfile does not add / remove any security, it is simply a location for NTP to store data. Use the distribution default value for it.
I have a clean install of Debian with the NTP client. I was given settings to secure secure my NTP client configuration. I know how to add them to the /etc/ntp.conf file but I am not if settings need to be merged or overwritten, if order matters, or how duplicate settings are handled.
