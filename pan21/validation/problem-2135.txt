The runts are frames which are too small, and the CRC errors mean that the frames didn't match what the FCS says they should be. This is a sign of corrupt frames coming into the interface. This can be caused by several things, but it is likely a layer-1 problem. You should always start troubleshooting at layer-1.
Frame check sequence errors, and packets which if your MTU is at the standard of 1514 when using the standard for ethernet on Cisco equipment are missing pieces of them. As mentioned above it is usually due to a layer one physical error. Do you get them on any other devices connected to this device? do you only get them on gi 0/13? check the cable, and do a check on the port itself. Check for duplex mismatch on the port, do a hardware diag on the actual port and trace out the physical path of where the error is and where it terminates to see if it repeats itself....if no errors are present elsewhere, it points to duplex mismatch or bad cable.
Seeing as you have a L1 switch connected to it, that could very well be a duplex issue. check the other side of the link.
If you look closely, you have 1557204 CRC errors, and 132 runts, for a total of 1557336 input errors. You may have a layer-1 problem.
