I just installed an Isilon clustered NAS. Started with 24 tera useable on a few nodes & can scale up to over a peta by just plugging in additional nodes. The nice thing is each node added gives both additional storage & throughput, as each node acts as a head node to the clustered. All in a single large filesystem
The Sun x4540 will support the storage size you need and ZFS makes it easy to share via CIFS for your Windows machines or you can export the storage over iSCSI.  However, as other have mentioned, you should really have a plan for backups and redundancy.  Since you don't have any IT staff a vendor who will set everything up for you is probably a good choice.
Normally I'd recommend a NetApp 3100-series for something like this, they're fast, easy to setup/use and pretty resilient but they have a hard-limit of 16TB per presented volume. If seeing this 24TB storage as a single volume is really important then perhaps you could use an HP EVA FC SAN box combined with Veritas Storage Foundation for Windows - that will allow you to see a single volume of up to 32TB. You should know that FC SANs are usually a lot more complex to setup and manage than NAS boxes.
