Also, if you intend to encrypt emails sent to a group emails, it would make sense to generate and share a private key among the group members. This can make it easy for the sysadmins to share passwords within their team for example.
But careful! If John wants to be able to later read the email he sends, he would have to also encrypt the email with his own key. This is a configuration option in most mail clients, not sure about Outlook.
Every user must have a private and public GPG key. They generate the key themselves and give the public key to the sysadmins to make available to everyone. John can then encrypt his email to Paul using Paul's public key, and then only Paul can decrypt it with his private key.
But careful again! If Paul is fired under odd circumstances and all of a sudden his email has to be audited, you are out of luck as only Paul himself can decrypt it. That is why it is good to have a master GPG key, and state in a policy that "all encrypted documents have to be encrypted with the master public key". The master private key password should be kept very safe to be used in an emergency.
