If you want to learn what the specs mean, let's start by breaking down all the components as a starting point:
4 Threads - using hyper threading, this is the number of virtual cores that your OS can use (each physical core is hyper threaded in to two virtual ones).
Your processor listed runs at 2.8Ghz as a dual core but can boost up to 3.46Ghz when it needs the power.
That should give you a starting point on where the cpu sits in the mix. Look it over and you can do a comparison as well.
35W is the chip's TDP (Thermal design power - the amount of power the cooling system in your computer should be capable of dissipating).
It has 2 cores on one die, each core has hyperthreading technology, so this give you 4 available process threads for multitasking. Core means individual processor.
Here are the exact specs for your mobile CPU: http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=49666&processor=i7-640M&spec-codes=SLBTN,SLBZU
Keep in mind, that mobile does not = desktop.  There are slight differences (chiefly power usage) between the two (as well as model number differences).
