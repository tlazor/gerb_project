Not only is it fast and responsive but it has the exact same features you could find in MacVim, as long as it makes sense in a terminal. Since then, using MacVim and/or Vim makes no difference for me and whether I use one or the other is dictated only by the context. Not by one being better than the other.
I've also encountered a slow terminal MacVim in iTerm2. I've tried everything I could get my hands on, but nothing seemed to help. Eventually, I narrowed it down to a setting in my .vimrc:
So, I removed it, and my terminal MacVim was significantly faster when navigating files. Maybe someone else, who's tried everything else, and has this setting turned on, will find this useful.
I've tried a good dozen times to compile Vim on my Mac but I've never managed to obtain a usable Vim: each time it worked but it was unbearably slow and laggy.
After loosing too much time trying to make it work I simply dropped the towel and created an alias to MacVim's bundled CLI executable.
I hadn't noticed a problem with it until one specific file started rendering at .25 fps, but disabling cursorline sped things back up.
Ideally, I want to use Vim from Terminal or iTerm2. However, it becomes unbearably slow so I had to resort to using MacVim. There is nothing wrong with MacVim, however my workflow would be much smoother if I used only Terminal/iTerm2.
I've tried running without any plugins or syntax highlighting. It opens files a lot faster but still not as fast as MacVim. But the other two problems still exist.
