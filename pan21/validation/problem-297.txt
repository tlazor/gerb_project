It should be easy enough to change the code to control a different drive board, or the network messages to send different data if required.
We have written a script for doing this with a PicoBorg as the control board called RemoteJoyBorg.py, found here.
I am working on a small robot that is driven using a joystick. As of now the joystick is connected to the Pi via USB and is driving the servos as intended. What I would like to do is get rid of the joystick attached to the Pi so that the robot can drive wireless around within range of a WiFi signal. I would like to attach the joystick to a laptop running Mac OS or Linux and drive the robot from there. What are my options? I have never spent much time learning about advanced network technology so this is new to me. If someone could tell me what my options are and maybe some resources explaining it I would very much appreciate the help. Thanks
The code is all free to use for any purpose, we just ask that you mention us if you publish it as part of anything :)
