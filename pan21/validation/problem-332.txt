I note you asked how its possible without using a new port and iptables as a forwarder.  I have assumed above that this means "no IPTables".  Depending on how literally you interpret this you might be able to insert a transparent proxy in the path - this would use a transparent proxy server and iptables, but no "new port". 
I have apache2 web server installed on Ubuntu Server which provides the service at 192.168.122.108:80. Also, I've been created a directory named ubuntu on apache's root directory.
Now, the idea is to link or mount this local directory to http://ir.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu or it's ftp pal! I mean if someone request http://192.168.122.108/ubuntu or http://192.168.122.108/ubuntu/dists, the local apache server should provide service from ubuntu.com transparently!
You would need to create a "fake" ir.archive.ubuntu.com site, and then modify the DNS for people using this site.  Depending on how this is done it could range from modifying the hosts file (easy, just add the line 192.168.122.108 ir.archive.ubuntu.com)  to redirecting DNS to your nameserver and providing the answer you want with a specially crafted zone or a modified routing table.
