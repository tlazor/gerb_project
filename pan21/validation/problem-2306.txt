FWIW, although you can name a directory something like test.png, I think that's likely to create confusion. Windows won't care, but users might.
Note that the correct answers here notwithstanding, windows does in fact attempt to classify a folder by its contents and change the presentation based upon the classification.
Unfortunately, sometimes merely dropping an mp3 file into a folder changes it's template to "music" even though the other 100 files are txt docs etc.: I don't need to rate my README.TXT as 5 stars with a run length of UNDEFINED.
As others have said, Windows doesn't use filename extensions to identify folders. Folders, also called directories, are actually files but they have a FileAttribute value that identifies them as folders rather than regular files.
This classification is called a Folder Type and windows has what is typically called Automatic Folder Type Discovery.
All I can add is... ...YES directories are FILES on disk.  NO they do not have a useable extension, but they do carry an extension of .dir in microsoft and dos based systems.  What defines them as a folder other than any attribute is a key value in the file table.  The extension is only used after that key value.
There are other FileAttribute values, too; Archive, Compressed, Encrypted are some of the more common ones. You can use scripting and programming languages to examine these attributes. Here's a post on the Scripting Guys blog about using PowerShell to work with file attributes.
If an excel file has certain extension and attributes that define it as an excel file, beyond the MFT or other information areas of the disk, they define it separately from other files.  A directory is a file list.  What the original post is asking for is vague to say the least.  But, I would like to know if there is any way to read that list, as in, what's in the directory.  If a directory is 12kb on disk, it's a list of files or simply a blank file, but it does have some attributes that define it as such, making it easier to identify.  Identifying these files could help in recovery situations, defining a naming scheme if filenames are in a list.  If they are nothing but pointers, you have some information you can use.  Either way, a more thorough understanding of what the original post wants is essential before any answer can be given.
which means, list all the files with the directory attribute, i.e., list of the folders in the current folder (c:\temp). Type dir /? for other options.
Folder extensions are .dir. If you right-click a folder and go to Properties > General, it says Type: File Folder (.dir). However, making file with such extension does NOT make it a folder. Also, there is no .dir entry in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. Maybe that's because in NTFS, folders have special attribute that tells device that it's a folder and that (.dir) in folder are just for distraction, since it didnt say such thing in Windows XP. 
In Windows Explorer (for Windows Vista and Windows 7) you can specify a search filter of kind:folder to find the subfolders of the selected location.
