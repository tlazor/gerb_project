In layer-3, IPv4 has a header checksum that layer-3 devices, e.g. routers or hosts, will inspect to verify the integrity of the IPv4 header, discarding any layer-3 packets with a bad header checksum. IPv6 has done away with the IPv4 header checksum. Layer-3 protocols do not care which layer-2 protocol carries their layer-3 packets, nor which layer-4 protocols they carry. Neither are they aware of any layer-2 or layer-4 checksums.
Ethernet has its own checksum, and it has nothing to to with IP, TCP, or UDP. Neither TCP not IPv6 have anything to do with the UDP checksum. UDP on the source will create the checksum, and UDP on the destination will verify the checksum.
Layer-2 protocols, e.g. ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc., may use a checksum. In general, layer-2 protocols will drop any layer-2 frame with a bad checksum anywhere along the layer-2 path. For instance, a switch will discard an ethernet frame with a bad checksum. Layer-2 protocols don't care which layer-3 or layer-4 protocols are carried in their frames, nor are they aware of any layer-3 or layer-4 checksums.
Layer-4 protocols, e.g. TCP, UDP, etc. may have a checksum. In IPv4, the UDP checksum was optional, but it is mandatory with IPv6. A layer-4 protocol will inspect it own checksum, and it will discard any datagrams with bad layer-4 checksums. Layer-4 protocols are unaware of any layer-2 or layer-3 checksums.
