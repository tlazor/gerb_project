You reduce the risk of something occurring that could be disastrous and rather than rolling the dice and hoping everything goes well you just go through a process to ensure that everything will go well.  If something goes horribly wrong, who cares.  You have your data.  This is the no stress method IMO>
This will insure your data integrity should something fail during the upgrade.  You can avoid the upgrade altogether and go down the longer road to get to a nice clean OS without issues and ALL your data.
You may feel like your OS is good and clean but chances are you have something in there from the time you have been using.  Perhaps even some malware.  Who knows?
If you upgrade without backing up any data loss would be your fault.  Even though the upgrade should work properly, I never do them.  Any issues in your current OS will just be migrated to the new.  
Much like upgrading from a previous version of Windows to a newer one, your files will not be overwritten, but will be moved to a folder called "Winows.Old". It still would not hurt to backup, as other than during the upgrade, there are many other risks that can make you lose your files. And keep backups on external media or on the cloud.
Updating to another edition, as in this case from Windows 10 (Home) to Windows 10 Pro, is done in-place. This process is simpler and usually takes less time than upgrading from previous version of Windows: No Windows.old folder is created. You will get the same Windows installation but with more features.
