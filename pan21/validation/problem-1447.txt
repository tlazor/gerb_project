Of course, more likely is that random people using it will get you into trouble with your ISP.  Firstly by doing things like using it heavily, sending spam, whatever else your ISP may take a dim view of.  And secondly just because you are sharing it.  My ISP expressly forbids sharing my broadband connections with other households.  If I do share it (and they notice) then I would be disconnected. :(
What i do all the time when using insecure networks is using a VPN-tunnel to somewhere i trust enough for the things i want to do (work or home). Even if you want your wlan to be open, you could at least secure your own communication ;)
If your wifi is open then random people using it to download illegal material may get you in BIG trouble.
Slightly offtopic, the Apple Airport Extreme adapters now have the option of a "guest" network.  This effectively gives you two networks, so you can use a secure one for your stuff and leave an open network (using a different SID, and no encryption) for everybody else.  I don't know how this hurts or helps you legality-wise, but it does allow you to be generous with your connection without having to put your own data at risk.
Occasionally, theives go through rubbish bins for scraps & reciepts that they can use to rip people off (credit card numbers, old bills & bank account details). If they are doing this then it is much easier/cleaner/nicer to do much the same with a wifi antenna & a laptop from their car or van. Don't let them do it. If you must be neighbourly, add the neighbours mac address to your access point & give them your WPA-2 key.
If your wifi is open then you need to make sure all your devices are secured individually.  It is the same as leaving a network cable haning out the window for anyone to connect to.  If your network is physically secure (and your wifi is also secure) then your router provides some protection against the big bad world.
In germany, iirc, there is a huge difference between 'neighbour doing bad things with your open wifi' and 'neighbour doing bad things with your (somehow) secure wifi'. It does not matter how secure it is, just the 'i made it secure' thing makes the usage of your wifi a crime and you won't have to take responsibility for others using it.
