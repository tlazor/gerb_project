The slight limitation here, is that the blog will catch all https traffic here, regardless of hostname, so https://othersite.example.com will point to the blog, and generate errors because the name doesn't match the certificate, but there's no way around that with one ip address.
Since you only want ssl on the blog then there's no problem with the setup you've proposed, just make it the only virtualhost listening on 443
I want to protect the login form of my blog application with an SSL certificate and I'd also like to have some subdomains set up for things like the Mint web stats package. Is this even possible using a non-wildcard certificate, e.g. the GoDaddy "Turbo" one that costs about $20? I don't really want to fork out for the cost of a wildcard certificate.
To be clear, the only place where I want to use SSL is within the main blog application and not on any of the subdomains. I think I read somewhere that you can't do this because if you're using SSL the Apache virtual hosts have to be configured to use IP addresses. I'd like to get a definitive answer on this.
Last time I setup a client with SSL we chose the DigiCert Unified Communications Certificate.  They needed Exchange and Sharepoint servers online with SSL that were running on two servers.  So we were able to register each server with both an external and internal names.  The nice thing I liked about the DigiCert UCC was that we could quickly and easily make changes to the certificate (i.e. add more names to the certificate)
