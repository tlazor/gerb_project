With blu-ray you may run into DRM issues, as Adam Ryan suggests. Your 6200 may not have HDCP. I don't know if that's always a showstopper.
Finally, of course, you need a Blu-ray drive and player software (which I'm assuming you knew already).
If the only video in for your TV is the PC you could plug the speakers into it; but if you've got other inputs (cable box, game console, etc) that's not an option.
The PowerDVD general system requirements listed here should give you a good idea of what you'll need.  To give you a taste, you're going to need a little bit of oomph graphically and with CPU and RAM (recommended is Dual-core or better on the processor or more and 1-2GB+ of RAM).  You'll also need to make sure your graphics card and TV have HDCP.
It looks like you'll need at least a GeForce 7600 GT, according to the requirements for popular Blu-ray decoder softwares ArcSoft TotalMedia Theatre and for PowerDVD (at least, the Blu-ray capable versions).   
Don't you need to run a digital audio cable between the GPU and the BR drive in order to output audio over DVI/HDMI?
I haven't tried blu-ray, but I have the same card and I use it to watch over-the-air HD ATSC broadcasts. Works fine as long as your processor is good (quad core, 2+gHz). Blu-ray might be higher resolution/ bit rate than that, but my CPU isn't working too hard, so my guess is it's possible. I have connected it using a DVI to HDMI cable to an HDTV, and it was awesome, until unfortunately I had to give the TV back.
