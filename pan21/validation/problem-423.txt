I will continue with my answer anyway as graphs are the right tool for visualization and moreover for analysis of your data even if you touched them accidentally! 
As a more detailed modeling, you may consider two nodes for each case corresponding to each timestamp and connect them with weights 1 or -1 or not connect them in case the change is zero. To avoid weights you can simply use directed graph in which an edge goes from node of case $X$ in time $t_0$ goes to node of case $X$ in time $t_1$ if the change is one and if it's -1, an edge goes from node of case $X$ in time $t_1$ to node of case $X$ in time $t_0$. The topology of connections also tells a lot in this case.
In both cases the visualization of graph might be intuitive might not. If not you can visualize different statistical measures on nodes, edges, degrees, graphs themselves, etc.
You can see your problem from Graph Theory point of view in different ways. I assume cases as nodes and changes as edges in simplest way. You may continue developing the idea to more sophisticated structures.
Very first input: Please confirm if you are really asking about Graphs as there are tones of misunderstanding between plotting and Graph as a mathematical object. In case you mean visualization and not Graph as a math object please let me know to edit your tags and title. 
Let's assume each case is a node in your graph. Then you can model each bacteria with one graph in which there is no edge between two nodes if the change is zero and an edge if there is, where the weight of edge is either 1 or -1 for different cases. Then you come up with 4 graphs on each of which you may do statistical analysis according to network topology.
