Next there is support. A new server will usually get 3 or 5 years warranty and next business day supports for a price. Support for hardware older than 5 years tend to get very pricy. Often is is cheaper to buy a new server with 3year NBD support than to get a support contract for years over 5. This conflicts with your goal of doing this cheap.
You write 'a small office', so I assume this point is less clear than it was in my case (single file server. 150 users all of which could not nothing if the file server failed). The price of a new server with equal performance to a 7 year old server compared to an extra day downtime for a dozen users might very well favour the new server. And that is with a new server which should last longer than 1-2 years.
Now, several edits later I got a lot of text, but all of it simply states: Do not use 7 year old hardware.  It probably will not save money on the long run.  Which means you can not justify the expenditure upper management.
Another point which might surprise you is the price for old legacy hardware.  You can not just go to a shop and buy extra RAM for the same price as you the RAM in your current generation desktop (DDR). You probably need to shop around. < $1K seems optimistic.
I can not not anything about the first point. Your admin might have some good reasons which are not clear to you. Or maybe he has not. Personally I would **not* want to use 7 year old servers if I could avoid it. Seven years is old. Hardware will fail at some time and that will cost you downtime. How much you can afford that depends on your business. Is it more expensive for an entire office not to access a server than to buy new hardware now (rather than over 2-3 years)?
Your could try to do this yourself. Which means multiple spare servers. And you should have a backup plan in case of failure which is more likely with old hardware. And unless the new office gets closed within a few years you will have to get a new server after a while anyway. Postponing that makes short term sense.
