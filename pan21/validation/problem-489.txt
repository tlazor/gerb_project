I am looking to extend my WLAN at home so that I can walk around the house without a noticeable connection break. Reading about this I find the possibility to use access points and repeaters. Access points connect to the wired network and use the same SSID, but a different channel. Repeaters connect to the wireless network and use the same SSID and same channel.
What puzzles me is: I can walk 1000 feet at work without loosing optimal WLAN coverage - all with the same SSID and all without connection interruptions. Any idea how they do this? I am using WPA-PSK, they use an open WLAN with encrypted entry site with password. Are there access points that can share channels? With WPA?
As we are living on 4 floors and each floor is made of concrete with steel there is no sensible place where to put a repeater. I would like to use access points. But when I do this I need to re-connect to WLAN when I change floors. The obvious solution is to create WLANs with different SSID: wlan-floor1, wlan-cellar, wlan-attic and wlan-floor2.
