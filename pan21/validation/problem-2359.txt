This happened on an old "SONY VAIO" Model: PCG-61112L. This computer was broken and I have fixed it but when I turned it on winload.exe was missing so then I created a windows 7 repair drive and fixed it up. Now I have windows 7 on my computer and when I started it up I was excited. But then the computer ran CHKDSK on startup and I thought I did something wrong. I'm wondering if this is normal after repairing/reinstalling windows.
You can check the S.M.A.R.T values of the disk via a  software called CrystalDiskInfo which also displays the drives health depending on how many sectors failed etc.
This could have happened in your case. When the computer was last used it was put into hibernation and the repair caused files to be changed.
If you have any important data on that computer I would highly recommend to make a backup of any documents, pictures etc., even if the drive is not failing it still very old and especially if used a lot may already have some bad sectors.
can also be very likely since the computer is very old and hard disk will start to fail at some point.
