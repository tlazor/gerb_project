That said, there are many paid options available for backing up data, usually ranging from $20-$50. It may be worth your time to just pick up a license for one of them.
As best I understand your question, you want to back up one external drive to another external drive, preferably using some sort of utility to automate it.
As for cloning the drive via Disk Utility, it depends on what kind of drive you are cloning to. If you are using a hard disk drive (with a magnetic platter), there should be no unusual wear and tear. If you are using a solid state drive, it will wear out the cells faster as everything is being rewritten with each clone, rather than a few cells here and there.
Time Machine is great for backing up a MacBook or iMac, and you can even set it up to alternate between multiple disks for redundancy, but Time Machine is not able to handle multiple distinct, separate backups on its own. It is designed to back up the system--and optionally any external drives that are formatted as either HFS+ or APFS--to its backup drive(s). It is not able to back up drive A to drive B while also backing up drive C to drive D. (At least not without a fair bit of fanangling each time you want to shift focus.)
