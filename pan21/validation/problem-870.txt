I'm trying to convert a simple diagram (boxes and arrows) into a Visio chart. There are lots of these boxes and arrows, however, so this will be a pain to do by hand.
An image doesn't store a picture of an arrow as "oh, there's an arrow going from here to there", it stores it as a white pixel followed by a black pixel followed by a white pixel and so on.
No. Visio stores objects like rectangles and arrows as separate objects so that when you reload it from a file you can move the rectangles and arrows separately. 
In short, information is destroyed when converting from Visio to an image - and that means there isn't enough information to convert it properly back again. The best you can do is import the image into visio, but sadly you won't be able to move the objects on the image independently of one-another.
More generally, attempting to glean information from a picture is an active research topic for artificial intelligence, but sadly there isn't a simple answer for taking a picture and breaking it down into its constituent parts.
I assume your simple diagram is not in the format of Simple Vector Graphics (SVG). Therefore, this will likely not answer your question. But it is related, and this may resolve issues for some other people who may be directed to this page. If your diagram/image is in the format of SVG, or you're able to convert/export your image to SVG from your imaging program, then you can import the graphics in Visio (I'm using 2013) with some degree of success.
