Whatever the user is, I need to give permission on the service's root folder to him. So, I went into the security properties of the folder and tried browsing Active Directory, but DOMAIN02 isn't listed. Hence, not allowing me to set permissions.
Given that the domain isn't listed, is it safe to assume that the domain is not accessible from that server?
Ps.: I'm using "domain" terminology here but, to be honest, I'm not sure wheter those are actual domains os subdomains. Does it make any difference?
The clients who will connect to this Web Service are on DOMAIN02 and they've requested that the user allowed on the service should be DOMAIN02\OTHER_USER.
And is there a way to set permissions correctly without being able to browse through active directory?
Sounds like there is no trust between Domain01 and Domain02.  To have Domain02 users available to assign rights in the file system of a server within Domain01, then you have to have Domain01 trust Domain02, one way, at minimum.  See TechNet.
I have a Web Service installed on DOMAIN01\SERVER1. This WebService uses Windows Authentication as its authentication mechanism.
