Maybe double check the ports the printer uses, it might be that windows allows information through its firewall pertaining to operational state and ink status, but the printer may use a less well known port for the actual printing, and might be the cause of the issue.
More advanced QoS done with on a Cisco router (for example) will allow you to do more than that, up to actually dropping specific traffic exceeding certain thresholds but I tend to believe that's not the case here. All this assuming that the QoS you configured does what you think it does. 
Most likely though I think it is an issue with the software install on your computer.  Especially considering it is localized to your machine. 
Typically the QoS found in the SOHO routers (I assume that's what you have since you don't mention the router type) will just prioritize some traffic at the expense of other traffic.
As mentioned before, you should temporarily remove whatever QoS rules you created and see if printing works. The fact that you can see ink levels means the driver can communicate with the printer (some sort of polling usually) so I don't think it's a firewall issue on your PC. Those firewalls usually allow outbound connections. 
Unless your SOHO router specifically supports QoS for WLANs, then I would say the settings you have only affect the LAN. That said, once your printer traffic is off the wireless and into the LAN, it will probably be marked with best effort (or whatever your lower QoS priority is).
QoS will either speed up or slow down traffic on your network.  Most likely it wouldn't disallow printing but if the printer software is very time sensitive it could cause the errors.
TL;DR - Unless you're using 100% bandwidth constantly (highly unlikely), QoS should only cause devices to slow down. Not to stop working completely.
If you are installing the driver, and connecting to local printer directly, but other users are connecting to a print cue located on a server, it is possible that the QOS is causing you issues. When you print to directly to a printer, the amount of data is quite large. With most drivers, a print job gets passed as a TIFF image. 
WLAN QoS is normally a completely different setting from LAN QoS, the only way to know for sure is to disable the QoS. If that does resolve the issue, I would say that its a bug with the QoS or the printer drivers, as QoS really shouldn't affect something like this.
So, assuming the wireless network is a different subnet/vlan as the one containing the printer...and that the printer and server/print cue are on the same vlan/subnet...and also that you are connected directly to the printer (safe assumption, since you can see printer stats), your large print job (tiff image) may be captured by QOS, while everyone else's job is passing from the server to the printer without ever crossing an L3 boundary, and being subjected to the QOS policy. 
But above all this, if this is a typical SOHO installation, then then printer will be on the local network and the traffic between your PC and the printer won't go through the firewall. 
Wireshark is also an excellent troubleshooting tool, you can try and see what kind of traffic flows between your PC and your printer, if any.
