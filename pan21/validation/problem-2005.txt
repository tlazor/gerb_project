Mechanical issues are even more of a mystery. Backblaze is a company that uses thousands of consumer-grade hard disks in their datacenter and regularly posts updates on their well-being. According to their estimates after 4 years of spinning 24/7 20% of hard drives died and if the trend continues, after 6 years half of them will be gone. This is more or less in line with figures from this Google whitepaper. However, that's not a standard use case for a hard disk and we can hardly compare it to a drive sitting offline in a box. I'm not aware of any studies that tackled this case.
That's the only estimate I could find. If that's correct, then you could safely rewrite entire drive every 5 years to "refresh" data.

I couldn't find any credible, scientifically backed data on this. Generally speaking, there are two aspects of this issue:
