You can either use the QuickTime player to watch your .mov videos, or you can still continue to use Windows Media Player. But in this case you'll need a product that makes available to WMP all the QuickTime codecs currently installed. A free product that does that is available here : QuickTime DirectShow Source Filter.
Before installing all these products, I suggest that you uninstall any doubtful codecs package that you may have already installed. After having verified that .mov files do work correctly, you can afford to install a well-known package such as the latest version of K-Lite Codec Pack.
The .mov videos are in a proprietary Apple format whose secrets are jealously guarded by Apple. Many Apple codecs have non-Apple implementations which are pretty good, but not perfect, which is probably the problem you're encountering.
The only video player that's guaranteed to play .mov videos correctly is Apple's QuickTime. You can download it here (be sure not to download the version with iTunes).
