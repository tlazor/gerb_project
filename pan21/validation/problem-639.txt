The OP questions is 5 years old, but the correct answer for the questions "Does a UPS lose its ability to protect equipment over time?" is yes, it does.
Some links regarding life time of IGBT inverters for solar panels, chips/IGBT modules are essentially same, they are widely used in devices like welders, hybrid cars, wind and PV power generators.
On larger UPS systems, simple on time replacement of dust filters is important procedure, failing to do so could affect cooling the essential components like inverters and they life span would decrease substantially. For example MGE UPS requires periodic service and maintenance by certified Field Service Engineers, they have a special tools and software for diagnosing many UPS components including battery charger, AC capacitors etc. High capacity electrolytic capacitors are also used in every UPS and in higher-than-normal temperatures their electrolyte vaporises and leads to failure. Such preventive maintenance allows to detect degrading components earlier and replacing them before thier ultimate failure.
Because unlike other IT equipment UPS deals with high currents and power, there are 3 main components in any UPS design: charger, rectifier and inverter. Most recent technology uses IGBT gates, but even those wears down and have a limited life time by nature.
