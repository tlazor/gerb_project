I have an ubuntu server and an arch linux machine. I've gotten quite used to the apache setup on ubuntu. It's simple and efficient. However, upon installing apache2 on my arch mechine, I noticed everything is different. The daemon doesn't even have the same name. Can someone explain to me:
From reading the docs for AL and in particular their package manager, pacman, I get the impression that they have rather strict rules as to how things should be done, in accordance to their "Keep It Simple" mind set as seen on their front page. For example, have a look at their package standards; it's the first time I've seen such a standard for any Linux system. I wish other distributions had them (or made them more obvious).
As to getting an Ubuntu-flavored Apache2 onto AL, I'd say "don't". If they have a well functioning system for where things should be installed etc, I'd follow their recommendations and instead learn to use the system as-is. If you run into problems and ask for help chances are they'll just ask you to install the standard packages instead.
