Well even after uninstalling this software,  checking msconfig,  and deleting the file folder, I even checked my services to make sure it hadnt creating one as well,  nothing there.  I was getting the same issue as the OP stated.  Theres one thing here that you folks missed,  and I did at first.  I noticed the same issue as the op,  when you look at the issue,  the window that pops up on startup is taskeng.exe  Dawned on me that this little pos rocketab software had created a scheduled task.  So anyone who wants to rid themselves of this anoying issue at start up,  needs to go into your taskscheduler and disable the two rocketab entries,  and or delete them.  This will rid you of this anoying software.  Hope this helps anyone else.
Issue: AFTER successfully removing the 'RocketTab' malware (using a utility such as Malwarebytes Anti-malware), Windows starts up with a 'Command Prompt' (cmd.exe) appears and is shortly followed by an error message reading, "Windows cannot find c:\program files(x86)\rocket tab\client.exe".
Resolution: Open the 'C:\windows\system32\tasks' directory. Locate and delete all files containing the word 'Rocket'. IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE the RTKCPL file. This is a legitimate Windows file. Restart your computer. The error should not return.
