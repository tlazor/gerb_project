If you are looking to put 10KW in a single rack, power is only going to be 1 of your worries.  Heat Rejection is going to be the other.  Rack power is determined by the PDU(s) that are installed in it. if you are starting to pull >1kw per outlet you would probably want High Density PDUs and to feed the antminers  208V as opposed to 110/120V (less amps more volts == smaller wire sizes).  Looks like the antminer pulls around 5.2A at 208V.  putting 10 of them in a rack would be 52A at 208. Well within range of most Blade Center type PDUS.   
It's also a way for a power sucking piece of equipment to spread its amp-load over multiple circuits. If you have an 80 amp requirement you can't fulfil that on any one circuit but you can spread that over 4x 30 amps circuits.
When they say there are 4 circuits per rack it just means 4 individual lines of power, probably with individual switches for each line. These are typically wired into Power Distribution Units (PDUs) that branch off into multiple electrical outlets within the rack.
This allows you to distribute your equipment's redundant power supplies over two or more circuits so that if there is a failure (accidental or deliberate) of any one circuit your racked equipment can continue to run on the other redundant power supply.
