You would need to add WiFI Access Points from the Switch to the rest of the building [or use repeaters] if you need to extend the WiFi.
You will lose the SuperHub's WiFi but I think it's a fair swap to finally be in full control of your routing/firewall. Bear in mind the SuperHub's IP changes as you switch if over from router to modem [from 192.168.100.1 to 192.168.0.1 at defaults] & that if you ever hard reset it, you will find it easiest to set back up again with a single computer plugged straight into it, to set it back to modem mode; saves having to rejig the entire network for the sake of a couple of button presses on its built-in web page.
Once set, you will have to lift all internal switching to inside the new router, in your case, the Airport, so you don't have stray devices outside the firewall unless you are intentionally creating a DMZ [which would be another topic]
The best solution I've ever found for a Virgin SuperHub is to dumb it down to pure Modem mode & set up a decent Router behind it. Saves having to bridge the good router & stops the SuperHub's tiny brain having to think at all.
