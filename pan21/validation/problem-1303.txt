Based on this, I would recommend either hosting internally or going with a hosting provider (you can see a list of them by Googling for "subversion hosting").  It seems that hosting yourself with an external provider would be the worst of both worlds - you'd have to deal with the security and administration without the benefits of your company infrastructure.  Hosting providers stake their business on making sure customers' data are safe, and some will execute NDAs to provide additional assurance, so it's reasonable to trust them enough to let them host your code.
Generally, you have 3 secure options.  I'll preface this with the disclaimer that I work for ProjectLocker, so I am generally biased toward a hosted solution for most companies.
I would run the SVN server locally and use an off-site backup (tape, rsync, online, cloudy, etc). If concerned about the confidentiality of data on an off-site backup service I'd encrypt the data and keep a copy of the encryption keys at a third location (e.g. home) or in a fireproff data-safe in the office.
It may not be useful to know what most companies do, because they probably do it in a myriad of ways and the most common way may not suit your specific situation.
