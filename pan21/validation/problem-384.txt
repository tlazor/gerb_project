What you CAN do is isolate critcial systems and secondary systesm. Web, SQL are secondary - DC are critical (no dv up = everything stands).
For a small network this is really the only choice you have.  We used to have our admin take a night each week dedicated to installing updates and rebooting servers.  Your biggest SPOF (single point of failure) will always be a single domain controller.  Without your DC nothing works so when you can upgrade... get another DC.
As for SQL and your Web server, again it is what it is until you can move to a SQL cluster (very $$$) and a small web farm.  You can setup a web farm with two servers pretty easily using the built in Network Load Balancer (NLB) and the IIS Web Farm Framework.
Yes, it is very hard to understand. Because you run 5 servers. My company network has 2 servers and EVERYTHING CRITICAL IS REDUNDANT. How comes you can not do tat wit h2?
Have critical systems manually rebooted, secondary ones to a specific convenient time. Make sure someone is there to watch at that time. We plan in a mainteannce window every month, mostly because for most of our systems "a second off" is a desaster during normal operations.
