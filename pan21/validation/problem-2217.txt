It's interesting that ImgBurn didn't work for you. I use it on my Win7 box just fine. Perhaps it's a driver/firmware issue? In any case, may be worth it to check out http://www.firmwarehq.com/ for new firmware for your drive.
All of these programs I believe (well, think) use native Windows functions and do not install any drivers. 
I have Windows 7 and a "HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-U20N".  When I used CDBurnerXP, it said that I didn't have any compatible burners.
CDBurnerXP When my requirements are slightly higher such as creating a CD that involves files from many different sources, or need to burn from a non iso/standard format.
I personally use Isorecorder for the small jobs where everything is in one place and  I just need to copy it to a cd/dvd QUICK. 
Deep Burner Personally I just keep this on a USB stick, I used to use it all the time, but I find myself using CDBurnerXP more and more. As this is a portable utility, it sometimes just comes in very handy.
Isorecorder A tiny program (uses native Windows functions, so it is just a GUI to features that already exist) that allows you to create ISO files easily by right clicking on a folder, and from there you can burn Iso's to DVD's and CD's very efficiently.
