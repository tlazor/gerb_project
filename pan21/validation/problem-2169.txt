I would certainly remove and re-seat every cable that's easily accessible to the end-user.  Badly-connected cables can cause incredibly hard-to-diagnose problems sometimes.
The next time it happens, restart your system, then go to Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Event Viewer, and look in both the Application and System logs near the time you experienced the lockup.  This may give you some clues if it's software related.
This sounds suspiciously like a bad motherboard to me, though it could also be the power circuitry. Run IntelBurnTest (for Windows) or another CPU stressing tool to rule that out first, then if you're unlucky, it could be the motherboard. I'd tell you to check for puffy capacitors, but laptops don't have those big, obvious capacitors like desktop boards do.
You could try the "neighborhood garage" technique, which involves swapping parts one at a time until the problem is fixed, but that could get expensive what with restocking fees on stuff like motherboards.
I would definitely try removing all non-essential pieces (the hard drive, for instance) and seeing if that solves the problem.  (With the HD out, boot off a Linux LiveCD and work for a few hours.)
When I was fixing computers, I would do a "binary swap" to diagnose this stuff--essentially, swap out half the components with another working PC and and see which one "inherits" the problem. If it's the "donor", then one of the parts that was swapped must be the problem.  If it's the "recipient" then it's one of the unswapped parts.  Then you swap individual pieces until you figure out which one is bad. Unfortunately this requires you to have another working identical laptop, which probably is not practical.
Unfortunately, this is likely to be a very hard-to-diagnose hardware problem.  For instance, a very slightly bad capacitor in some circuit on the motherboard could do this.
