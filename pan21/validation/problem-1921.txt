I want to subscribe a daemon, inotify-style, to receive a notification when free space on a given filesystem dips below a certain percentage. Is this possible?
You can use the Monit utility for this. You can set the interval with which this checks, but 60 seconds is the norm for polling.
Since there will be more things you want to monitor, you might want to spend some time learning nagios.  It sounds like you had a case where you ran out of space, and you don't want that particular failure to happen again.  But systems can fail in unexpected ways, and all services should be monitored.
To test, set the threshold to something you know breaches it now and then touch a file on the affected filesystem. You should get your monitor file created.
This uses a very recent system call API called fanotify. Probably need a 2.6.37 kernel or greater to run it (so EL5 is out of the question, for example). If you get complaints it wont compile, its probably too old a kernel.
This will setup the monitor. Every closed file handle on the filesystem that had a write flag open initiates the event check.
In a pinch you can just use the plugins.  They're easy to install, and do what they say (check_disk checks disk space).  They return "not 0" on failure.  Failure can be warning, critical or unknown.
Add something like this to crontab will trigger $send_error on failure.  It will be triggered if > 50% of partition "/" is used.
Obviously its probably best to put the monitor file somewhere not on the same filesystem (/dev/shm is a good place).
This works as an event based mechanism. I've not ran it for long periods so wont guarantee its stability.
