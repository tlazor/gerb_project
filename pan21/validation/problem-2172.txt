So the question is, how average is 'average Joe'? You've already mentioned code editing and memory editors. That's above what I would personally consider the average level, and if you do want to be worried about that level then a separate trusted server which does all the heavy lifting is required and the client will boil down to essentially just being display and input devices.
If you are worried about locally modified code, then how can you be sure that someone hasn't simply modified your notification code to send a static list of MD5 hashes, the same ones you expect? In fact, you don't even need code modification to do this, you just need a fairly basic proxy (assuming no SSL, but even that could be faked with a bit more effort).
The only way to do what you want is to have a server and simply not trust the client at all. All calculations should be handled on the server and all actions verified as being at least somewhat possible. For instance, don't allow the client to say that they want to move to one side of the map when you know they were on the other side a moment ago. Without a server in the middle doing everything that is vital to the game, it is impossible to not have cheating, because someone smart will always find a way around anything you can build into the client. Even with one, it is still possible if you don't think through all the different ways to manipulate the situation slightly. For instance, the movement validation I mentioned before: If you do a simple point to point calculation people may still be able to teleport through walls.
