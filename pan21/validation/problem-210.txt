When you send a fax you know if the other person has received it , where as there are no foolproof methods of confirming that the other party has received and read your mail (as far as i know ) .
Now, here's the problem - If I send it on to someone, it looks like they can remove my signature (image).
Is there any way of making this permanent, so that no one (or at least no one but me) can remove or modify it?
Organize / Flatten Page . . . to make the signature at the document layer, and it should not be able to be deleted by others.
Even if I set the Properties to "Locked," it looks like the next person can un-check the Lock box and delete it.
So Acknowledgement of document  and guaranteed readability are two situations where you might consider sending an fax instead of email .
I was asked by an insurance company to fax or email banking information. I opted for old school fax simply because chances of being intercepted by a third party is far less.  But mostly because the email along with my banking info would remain on my email server, and on the insurance company's server, legally for a long time and perhaps forever. Given the recent email hacks, it is not worth the risk.
Or, you might create 1,000 20-digit passwords in a spreadsheet, numbered 1 to 1,000.  Password protect that, e-mail it to the recipient, and phone him the password.  Then you can e-mail a password protected PDF through e-mail, and include in the e-mail that it's password number 0850, or something.
Faxing official documents with signatures and stuff like that just makes it easier for people at the receiving end. They don't have to go through printing tons of papers, instead the fax will take care of it AND will display your fax number at the top (for easy organization).
So, what I did was to scan in my signature and initials. Then when I get a document, all I have to do is "Add an Image" to put my signature and initials in the right place.
I don't think that fax has any significant advantage over email other than this. In the foreseeable future, you might able to have a type of 'email machine' where companies would have an email server with a special email for each department. Every email received would go through filters to remove any kind of spam and only accept legitimate emails. The machine would then catch these emails, send them to the 'email machines' of the department in question and it would be automatically printed off.
