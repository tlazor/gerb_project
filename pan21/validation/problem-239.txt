I am planning on setting up an old computer as a media center, linux web server and backup storage device. It's loud and ugly so I'm going to run it in my basement.
If, however, you use a VNC or "Remote Desktop" tool to connect to your file server, then you're actually running programs on the server, and all that gets sent over the network is the final, decoded graphics. (Usually. I've heard rumours of people playing graphics-heavy video games over Remote Desktop, and I am not 100% sure how it works. It might be that RDP also allows decoding video on the client side.)
I want to use it to store files, videos and pictures, and then access said media with other wired and wireless devices on the network.
I know if I were to run linux webserver on there I'd want a good CPU for speed, but are there other uses of the basement computer where a solid processor would be of benefit?
When I access the basement computer over the network, and open up movies or images across the network from another device, does the storage computer's processor even enter the equation? Would video playback be smoother with a quicker processor, or is it the access device's processor that handles the video?
This is actually very similar to watching videos on YouTube – it is the player whose CPU and GPU are used to decode video data downloaded from YouTube servers.
In most cases, if you access the movies through NFS or Windows "File Sharing", then the server is not doing much – it only reads a file from disk and sends it to you over the network. For this, the CPUs aren't loaded much, and file servers don't need a GPU at all, as most of the work (decompressing the video data) is done by the same program and on the same device that actually shows the movie on screen.
