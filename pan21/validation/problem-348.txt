This can be disabled in the system BIOS by navigating to the ILO portion of the configuration and deselecting "Shared" and either choosing "Disabled" or "Dedicated".
You should be able to see the MAC address of the network interface that has acquired the lease. From there it should be trivial to look at the MACs of the ILOs in your three servers and see which has a lease. You could also just find the one that someone accidentally plugged in, since they'd have to be plugged in to get a lease.
Some HP server models have only one NIC which serves both as standard network card for server inside OS and iLO port. 
As MDMarra said iLO default credentials are usually on a sticker or a tag tied to the server and can be reset by pressing a key during boot (it should say during boot what key to press to enter the iLO config utility) or by hardware switch to no ID and password, I remember that they can also be reset with HP utility that can be installed inside OS. Check your manual or HP pages for your server model.
Are you suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure about that? ILOs don't magically grab IP leases out of thin air with no physical connection. They're cool technology, but they're not voodoo.
There is usually a sticker on the side of the server that has the ILO's MAC and default user/password. You can also usually reset this by going into the ILO BIOS during boot. These things are outlined in more detail in the manual, you should read it.
If these are ProLiant DL100-series servers (DL160, 165, 180, etc.), you have a shared ILO port on the first interface of the server. This is not a traditional HP ILO, but rather, a trimmed-down version called the HP Lights-Out 100i (LO100i). By default, this is a shared-port, but an optional dedicated interface add-on is available.
