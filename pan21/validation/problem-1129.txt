Since I would want to stick with HAProxy for FTP, HTTP, IIS servers, I got confused on using it side by side with LVS.
HAProxy seems to be a commonly used LB, but it is not capable of handling UDP load balancing. This is a bummer, since I like how HAProxy works. 
The original request was to load balance FTP servers. I tried doing that using the current load balancer (Piranha / LVS), but didn't get it up and running. Not just because there's little to none documentation for this software. Since Piranha is considered deprecated, I went over to HAProxy after a couple of days trying, which did the job in a fraction of time spent on Piranha.
Is this possible? Is UDP load balancing on DNS servers even necessary? Is there any kind of resource that might show me how to get started with that? Or is there a LB solution that is capable to not only handle TCP/HTTP, but also UDP load balancing?
So I googled a lot and came across several things. Most people seem to use LVS as a LB for DNS (TCP/UDP). Some use dlbDNS, some use lbnamed, and some use netfilter / iptables.
So I've got FTP load balancing (passive mode) in place. Now, I was asked to replace the whole Piranha Load Balancer in the data center. In the current Piranha configuration, we have several web servers, IIS servers....aaaand DNS.
