Now you need a maintenance window where you can kick everyone off the server.  Boot to single user mode, re-mount /home and /mnt/new-home, and run the rsync command again.  This rsync run should be fast since 99% of the work has already been done.  (Or at least faster than running it for the first time, anyways -- I've had "single-user, last-pass" rsyncs run for up to four hours to do almost nothing...)
You can do that part with the system live and users logged in.  In fact you can do it more than once -- subsequent runs should be faster since most of the data is already there, and the --delete flag will clean up files which have been removed.  (man rsync will help you with the other flags I've selected.)
The reason why I don't use mv as recommended by ThorstenS is because I've had bad experiences where mv would crap out half-way through.  By using rsync, if you make a dog's breakfast of new-home, you can always unmount it, newfs it, and you are back in business -- no data lost.  And also I like to keep the old source around for a while just in case my brand new 1TB drive tosses itself in the first week.  After a while you'll be happy with the new drive (or desperately need the space occupied by the old) and you can clean it up.
When that's done, change /etc/fstab so that the partition you've been using as new-home gets mounted as /home.  You can also mount the old home partition as /home.old, or if it was just a directory in a larger partition, rename it to /home.old.
I'm a little more conservative, because I've had to do this on larger systems, with data that .  My method:
