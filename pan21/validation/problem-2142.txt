However, print_fizz_buzz_output directly prints the result. So I cannot use it if I want to do anything else. You’d be better off either:
Overall, the code is quite good, but I have a few comments (in addition to the other good comments above):
As it stand, your "real" FizzBuzz code is contained in print_fizz_buzz_output, the rest being a mean to grab parameters values from the user.
I like that the input functions actually check the entered input matches the wanted type. Though in some cases a user might like to be able to abort some action at the prompt, so returning None or some default value for an empty input might be one choice. 
I’d choose the second option since it allows for better reusability and you can still call list on the generator if you trully want a list there:
Then you can rename it to ask_confirm. This allows you to abstract the notion of asking a confirmation with how it is done. You can then consider changing the implementation, and for example support other languages, with localized responses which would not need to be y/n.
You can make is easier to use by returning a boolean directly, so the caller does not need to make the comparison.
