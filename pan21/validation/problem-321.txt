If you're not a DBA - i.e. you're not experienced with the complexities of replication, failover, subtleties of transaction isolation, etc - then if possible do not use multi-master.
Frankly, multi-master clustering is pretty underwhelming even in products that do have it available. Performance tends to be pretty poor and scale badly. This isn't a deficiency in the products, it's just that MM clustering is hard and you pretty much get to pick either correct or fast.
Personally, I recommend using two big nodes. Have one node running a streaming replica and the other running as master. If one goes down, fail over to the other. Tune your app and queries properly before adding more capacity.
There's no multi-master clustering for PostgreSQL, only multi-master replication via 3rd party add-ons. These add-ons have a significant performance impact, but more importantly they don't deal with inter-node locking and transaction isolation. Concurrent transactions on different nodes can see different data, can both modify the same rows, etc.
