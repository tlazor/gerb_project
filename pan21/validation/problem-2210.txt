Read this and especially Hardware Limitations part. Each phone/pc has it's max_texture_size and if exceeded - will print a black texture.
If you have bad texture coordinates this can happen. But it could be your texture atlas itself is wrong or you even try to use the wrong atlas. So check that as well.
I have such situation in my GDX game: I have a static class that manage my Drawables. It's a Singleton. I want to load all my Textures to it in order not to load them at every turn when I switch between screens (I know this is bad practice but I need this). I pack my resources into a TextureAtlas and load them. But when I pack and load more then some amount of Textures and try to use them some of them become black. Why this is happens? How can I bypass this unfortunate case. The size of my TextureAtlas (four images and one .txt file) is about 4MB.
Well. I hope this will help somebody. Some of my textures were black because of their resolution. The resolution of one of them was something about 1200x2400 pixels.
