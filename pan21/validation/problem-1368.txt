We have the We are using a network of 192.168.0.0 (Which is unassignable to one specific client) with the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (allowing addresses from 192.168.0.1 up to 192.168.0.254). This means our broadcast address will be 
I am trying to manually alter my /etc/network/interfaces file in Ubuntu.  I am using these as a baseline:
I want to alter my wireless card, which according to ifconfig is NOT eth0 but wlp16s0 so the 1st thing I would do is change that.  My only question is what value would I input in broadcast
The Broadcast address would be the highest non-assignable address for your subnet. It determines the end point of your network, where the network is the start point.
I know that the address is the IP I want to hardcode, gateway is my router IP, netmask is my DNS, network is my router IP
In all honesty, I don't think it would harm to leave these unset (although I haven't tested this as I don't have a UNIX system to test with). They're usually just for reference and can be automatically worked out from the host IP address and subnet mask.
The address is indeed the manually configured IP address for the client and the gateway, in most cases, would be your routers IP address. However, the netmask is not related to DNS in any way, but defines the range of IP addresses available within your subnet. You can read more about this here. Also note that the network address is defining the start point of the network, not your routers IP address. This should be the opposite of the broadcast address, the IP address before the first assignable address.
