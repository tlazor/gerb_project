I cannot for the life of me figure out how to create a LAG between these switches. The ports in question are all on the same subnet (marked blue in the diagram) so there is no VLAN tagging / trunking required, I think. I just want all the blue ports to behave as one switch. I also cannot figure out how and whether LACP comes into play.
Can someone please either provide me with specific instructions or guide me to a specific tutorial about what settings I should be using? I prefer using the web admin GUI but I do have serial access to the devices if need be. Any advice or guidance would be much appreciated.
depending on your needs, you typically want static lag,  unless you use virtual port channels, vlt, or the endpoints only support one or the other.
Right now we have two independent switch stacks jointed with a single ethernet cable. For throughput and redundancy I would like to join them with a LAG. One switch stack is made up of Dell 7048's, the other is Dell 8132's (now called N4000 I believe). See diagram below.
