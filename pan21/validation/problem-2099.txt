Depending on your reporting requirements you may also consider creating a summary table, which will have data already pre-aggregated for your reports. It can be populated overnight and speed up your reports dramatically (indexes is a must on this table too). You can even populate this summary table several times during the day without locking the table by using READ UNCOMMITTED - it is unlikely that you need precision to every visitor.
I have a second table that maintains the history of each visits, which means I if the same visitor visits the site, I insert into the second table and update the no. of visits on the first table.
I need to decide between partitioning the tables by month and sub-partitioning by days for the reports 1,2,3 and index the browser related columns for report 4. 
Although there will be a number of tables (you may keep e.g. a table per quarter and then have second line of archiving to a table with month/browser key) it will be manageable, because partitions are quickly switched from one table to another.
Does partitioning/sub-partitioning along with indexing help in the performance of inserts and selects?
On an average there are about 20000 inserts to the second table and about 15000 inserts to the first table, meaning 5000 were updates to the first table (5000 repeat visits).
table (1-2 months of data) partitioned by day and browser. And another History table for archive partitioned by month/day.
