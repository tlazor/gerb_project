For example, you could get a NAS box with several drives in it, not just 2. Then you have the option of either RAID 5 or 6 (Here is a basic RAID information page, and here is a more advanced explanation of what RAID does (very dry)), where even when you have a drive failure, you can still access the information you need for the business whilst the failed drive is being rebuilt onto the spare automatically. At least then if your Dad's photography business is very successful he can add drives to the NAS instead of buying more seperate 2 drive NAS boxes. 
RAID 10 or RAID 5 will do the trick. However, for him to be able to save one year of work, he needs in excess of 3 terrabytes... Which will be a lot to handle... I best suggest he compresses it a bit when backup up the data...
Second, RAID 1 is very expensive when you have to backup large ammounts of data. It duplicates the ammount of drives needed for the job.
You don't need linux to create a RAID, unless you are doing it without a RAID controller. If you are unfamiliar with Linux then a RAID controller is probably the best thing for you.
With regards to your existing NAS solutions, if the drives in questions are different in size and they don't work out of the box as advertised you may have grounds to return them since, as you put it so well, they are 'not fit for purpose'.
To be honest I believe the question is 'How much do you want to spend?'. Based on that and how available you want the information to be is where you can start from.
Qnap have a large range of NAS units more directed to small businesses that may fit your need. More drive bays, good performance and a few more features. They are quite expensive though so it might be out of your price range since you didn't specify one.
