Microsoft seemed to be implying to me that I wouldn't get any of the above, which seems ridiculous.  At the very least, I should be entitled to (1.) security fixes and (2.) bug fixes with any license I buy.  I could also reasonably see another line drawn somewhere between (3.) minor feature updates and (4.) major feature updates.  I would never expect to get a (5.) major new version - that has always required a new license.
According to Microsoft, the differences between lifecycles, in terms of upgrades anyway, are as follows for each type of upgrade:
I remember when Office365 originally launched, Microsoft was saying that they would not be providing "updates" for customers who decided to purchase the normal, old-school, "perpetual" licenses (retail copies or otherwise).  I also remember them saying that if you bought a Product Key card (also a perpetual license) that Microsoft would "remember" the moment that you activated and downloaded a copy of Office using the Product Key, and would always save a "snapshot" (presumably of that build) of Office, and that you would never be able to update that either.
Perpetual, year-numbered releases of Office are covered by the standard Fixed Lifecycle Policy. The Fixed Lifecycle Policy may be summed up as follows:
Although all Microsoft products are supported within the company's Product Lifecycle Policy, the exact level of support varies depending on which type of Office you use. Large companies may have a separate support agreement, which can change things a bit, but we'll focus on consumer support here. 
So it is clear to me that if I have a valid Office 365 subscription, I get all of the above.  What is not clear to me is which, if any, of the above kinds of updates does a perpetual (physical or digital) license entitle me to?
I've been confused about this because of ambiguous language since Microsoft Office 365 launched.  I remember spending an hour or so trying to figure out a definitive answer at launch time.  I've spent about 15 minutes doing the same now, and I just want to get this sorted now, once and for all.
