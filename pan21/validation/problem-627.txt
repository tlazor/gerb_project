You want to get snapshot 10 on BoxB, but you don't want to have all the intermediate snapshots (4,5,6,7,8,9).
After this completes (notice we used lower case -i, not upper case -I!), you end up with the following situation:
Basically the receiving system has not received a bunch of snapshots since I found it had run out of space. So I deleted a bunch of VERY old snapshots on the receiving zfs file system and left the more recent ones, but the zfs system that does the zfs send has a lot of even more recent snapshots that don't exist on the zfs receiver (backup server). But I do NOT want to replicate ALL the missing snapshots back to the snapshot they have in common. I would like to simply send the most recent snapshot couple snapshots to the zfs receiver.
Is there a way I can send ONLY the latest snapshots to the backup zfs system even though it has previous snapshots? When I try I keep getting error: 
Currently the zfs receiver has the first couple snapshots ever created and then the rest were deleted and only ones left were the latest it had from around sometime in October 2018. So I would like to avoid sending Every Daily snapshot since October 2018 from the Zfs Sender system to the zfs receiver and just send only the last couple snapshots. 
"cannot receive new filesystem stream: destination has snapshots (eg. mirrorpool/ETC/Stuff) must destroy them to overwrite it"
Or is there some sort of just "rsync" type of zfs send | zfs receive where I can just keep the two datasets in-sync without sending over any snapshots? 
Note that since we're specifying -R for zfs send, we're actually also going to be sending (and receiving) any hypothetical child datasets or zvols, such as pool/dataset/child0, pool/dataset/child1, and so forth. (Also be aware that things get kinda weird if you don't have the exact same snapshots available on all child datasets, when you use -R with zfs send.)
