Kudos to user60069, it worked for me, but I use the shell-specific startup file .bashrc, so logging in with /bin/sh worked for me.
From the suggestions and responses given above, I'd say it's not the .bashrc or .bash_profile files. Also ssh manpage says that if you specify a command to be executed then your profile files won't be read. 
However, if you are in the "no such luck" situation, I offer this solution, based on user60069's and Dennis W's solutions:
Run "man bash" or "man (your shell)" for options to disable the start up files. You only need to use an abhorrent shell for the time it takes to fix the problem.
If you system is setup normally, .bash_profile won't be run for a non-interactive shell (such as running a command).
I'd suggest try executing a different login shell (ksh? csh? sh?) from the absolute path; also, beware that it might be a totally different problem (quota? execute and read permission on your home directory?), so a side approach would be better. Can you ask another user to do a ls -la $YOUR_HOME_DIR and mail you the result? 
You can try to overwrite the .bash_profile with an empty file using the scp command. From what I have googled, scp use a non-interactive login that does not read .bash_profile.
