If C: and D: are both different hard disks, this is simple. Just take out C:, put D: in its place, boot from the Windows 7 installation dvd, and repair the boot. You can now install the old C: in place of D: and reformat it.
Congratulations, you've just removed every trace of XP. Unfortunately at this point, your computer is no longer bootable because you've just clobbered your system partition. The good news is that you're already in the Windows 7 setup screen now, so just tell it to repair your system and it will recreate everything it needs to boot.
If C: and D: are both partitions on the same hard disk, this is a bit more complicated. What I would do in this case is use a partitioning tool such as Paragon Partition Manager Free Edition to delete the XP partition, move the Windows 7 partition to the top of the disk (as much as possible), enlarge it to include the empty space now at the end of the disk, then use the Windows 7 installation dvd to make this partition bootable.
Theoretically, that should fix your boot records. However, when I tried this once, it said it couldn't find any Windows installations to configure. Don't fret -- just reboot with the Windows 7 DVD once again and try a system repair.
I would suggest before starting out to use the Paragon Backup & Recovery Free Edition (or another utility) to take a backup image of the whole disk, just in case.
