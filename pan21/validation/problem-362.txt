After everything else I did as in the question, I did one more thing before trying to debug the process or communications - I deleted the OST file, for the problematic (small) Apps account (while Outlook was closed, of course).   
I found that EVGA percision X was creating these problems for me.  when i removed it, they went away.
Outlook kept hanging up / freezing / not responding when I sent an email. I  Even after a clean system refresh, online repair of office 2016, uninstall and reinstall of office 2016, only using an outlook.com email account with only 100 megabits of data, deleting profile and resetting it 3 times, uncheck graphics hardware acceleration, and everything else I could find on the web, I finally fixed the problem on my Windows 10 machine.  
For me, my freezing problems are solely from ActiveSync / Exchange. Whenever I attempt to send an email, viewer an email, access my contacts and Outlook "Stops responding" I take a look at the Outlook icon and sure enough Outlook has connectivity options with my Exchange server. This disconnection problem occurs at any time from changing networks to resuming from sleep to starting a VPN - anytime I change my network configurations or IP addresses.
I doubt that the issue is with the Google Apps accounts (I use Google Apps and Exchange). IMAP does not require an active connection, while Exchange does. (IMAP can and Google supports it, but Outlook does not) I think the problem lies with the Hotmail Activesync setup (Mobile Exchange). Your observation "With only the Apps account enabled, it seems to not lock up." would seem to support this conclusion - simply, whenever Hotmail looses the connection to Exchange, Outlook may freeze while it attempts to reconnect. 
I am not 100% sure what actually fixed the problems I was having, but apparently something I did made it stop happening...
