Reading MVMC guides makes it seem like once the VM is converted and uploaded onto the destination server, it shuts itself down on the source. Is there a way to cleanly convert VMware snapshots into Hyper-V files?
Essentially this (and most other conversion methods I know of) will carry out a swing migration of the VM Guest running on the 'old' hypervisor and move it to the 'new' one. 
SCVMM will allow you to manage both vcenter and hyperv 'side by side' in the same interface, which will make this task much simpler, as well as making the ongoing management of the hyperv cluster much easier afterwards.
I haven't used it myself, but I know Starwind has a free VM image converter available on their site. Here's some more info on that: http://www.starwindsoftware.com/converter
Frankly, I still suggest getting hold of an eval copy of SCVMM to help with the transition even if you don't keep it around afterwards.
One thing worth noting is that it sounds like their converter makes the conversion without affecting the VM's operations, but I don't have any experience with it to be sure of that.
When we converted, we used System Centre Virtual Machine Manager (hereafter referred to as SCVMM as life's too short) to take care of this. If you're serious about HyperV and you currently use vCenter to manage a VMware farm (rather than just having a couple of ESXi hosts that don't do much together) then I do strongly suggest it.
After using several hypervisors, Hyper V, VMWare, Xen, I'd suggest saving yourself some trouble and not converting at all. If you have the tooling in place you would be much better off just building your environment again.
Our company is looking to try out Hyper-V as a server virtualization solution so I am looking for the most efficient way to test everything out safely. My plan is to make a snapshot backup of each of the 10 VMware VMs (these are live production servers) and then use Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter to convert the snapshots into Hyper-V files. Then I would install Hyper-V services on a test machine running Windows Server 2012 Datacenter Edition and upload the converted VMs into Hyper-V. Being new to networking, does this sound like a solid plan? What potential issues could I run into?
This way you can also be sure that none of the VMs have the same networking, etc, as the current production environment.
This obviously means having both running and once and (if I remember rightly) will include making changes to the config of the 'old' VM, such as removing (or at least disabling) the guest additions, installing new drivers, etc. As such, I strongly suggest that what you do is snapshot the test VMs prior to the move, carry out the move and see how that goes, and if you decide to stick with VMware then restore the snapshots you took prior to the move.
