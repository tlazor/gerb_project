There are scanners and/or scanner software that have options to deal with this. Canon's canoscan lide 25 software for example (scangear) has a "simple mode" in which you chose whether the source is grayscale, lineart (I guess), full color - photo, or full color - magazine. If you scan a magazine with the settings for photo it will be awful. Someday I have to see if these settings are "inherited" by the advanced mode, so I'd take note of them and use these settings also on linux, whose scan software has not this convenience.
And I believe the previous answer is somewhat the opposite of what happens. If you scan with a tremendous resolution, the you won't get smooth colors, but in fact just a higher definition of the dots. The settings that deal with that may have something to do with a different exposition or perhaps a smart blur. At least changing the source on scangear does not automatically changes the DPI.
By the way, on windows/scangear I don't have even these "trail" defects (I notice a few fairer lines on the image, most around the backlights, I'm assuming it's a scanner artifact, not present on the source), somehow. Got to find which settings solve that too.
