The data on the disk is encrypted by the WD firmware. The only way to salvage it is to buy the exact same model (used from eBay), exchange the disks and pull your data off there.
A professional data recovery assistance is your best bet on getting any of the data back. I'd also advise against using third-party adapters because the WD My Book incorporates a hardware-based encryption that prevents you from accessing your files without using the original/genuine WD enclosure. 
I had the same thing happening, but fortunately, I had two of them, so I could just swap without hunting the scrapyard.
I'd strongly recommend you consider contacting a Professional Data Recovery Company for assistance with the files, since they are so important to you, @Pht. I see that your WD My Book passes the Quick test, but it's also important to pass the Extended one as well. Doing data retrieving attempts by yourself is highly dangerous when you are not aware of the kind of damage/corruption you are dealing with. 
I'd avoid using any kind of SATA to USB conversion.  Find a regular desktop computer and connect your drive to an empty SATA port as a second disk, and then boot the OS that's on the primary disk.  If it's still intact, the OS should see it.  If the PC is running Windows, try the DISKPART command and then LIST DISK to see if Windows can see it.  For Linux, run fdisk -l. (That is a lowercase L).  Another thing you can try is cloning it with some free cloning software.  Most of those have some sort of utility that lets you browse the resulting image and even copy out individual files.
