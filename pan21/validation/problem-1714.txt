But you additionally have two Control Inputs that influence the system. That is, the angle and force of the ship's engine!
That is, we want to find a Control Law, which is a function that determines the engine angles from the position, the velocity and some target:
Physics is what happens to the system due to the laws of nature. In space, there is no friction, and no forces acting on your ship besides the engine so the physical system is very simple:
I think some of the answers here are missing something. I think what you really want is controls and not physics. Let me explain. Control theory explores the mathematics of systems that can sense a value, and control themselves to reach a target value. Examples of this include climate control systems, anti-lock breaking systems in cars, robots, and yes even spacecraft in space.
So the question you should be asking is: what angle should the engine be pointing at, and how much force should it apply?
Always point the engine toward the target, at full thrust"*. As you can imagine, what this will cause your space ship to do over time is just to accelerate as quickly as possible toward the target, overshoot the target, and then oscillate around it. What you've invented is something called "Bang Bang Control." What you said you want instead is something more useful: you want the space ship to move toward the target, slow down on approach to the target, and then stop when it reaches the target. To do this, I recommend something called PD Control. This kind of controller applies more thrust when further away from the object, and less thrust when closer. It also applies thrust to resist the motion of the spacecraft. It's actually very simple:
PD control will cause your ship to move smoothly toward a target and stop. By tuning KP (the proportional constant) and KD (the damping constant), the movement can be made to oscillate, move quickly, or move slowly. Basically, the PD controller is simulating a spring with friction. The great thing about it is that no matter what physics you throw at the system (say if you add gravity, or collisions with obstacles), the PD controller will still drive the space ship toward the target.
