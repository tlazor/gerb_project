A malicious attacker (inclduing a compromosed computer, in the case of security tokens that are physically attached to the computer) can't steal the secret out of a security token (at least, that's the idea).
A USB flash disk (at least, the vast majority) are not active processing elements. They can't perform cryptographic operations (signing a message, generating the HMAC of a message, etc) and the bits that they store are, by design, easy to copy.
A security token contains a secret (private key, random number generator seed, etc) that can't (easily) be removed from the device. This tamper-resistance is the reason that the device (and, indeed, an entire system based on these devices) has any security properties. You can say, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the bits inside the security token only exist inside that token, and can't be copied to other tokens / devices.
Security tokens are tamper-resistant processors. USB flash disks are storage media. These things are, fundamentally, two different things. You're comparing apples and oranges.
