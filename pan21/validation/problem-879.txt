Since they're right next to each other you won't get really any benefit and if they aren't very good Access Points, they could interfere with each other.
You are trying to handle the fact you have poor coverage as per the beginning of your post. So just move your RouterB to another location and handle the coverage issue fully so both wireless device cover their own area.
You brought RouterB into the mix because RouterA wasn't cutting it. So why would you continue to use RouterA? If I have to bring in another piece of equipment because my current equipment isn't doing the job then I'm going to get rid of the equipment that isn't doing the job.
As long as "Router A" and "Router B" have their wireless radios set to different non-overlapping channels the amount of interference they'll create with each other will be negligible and since you're using the same SSID on both clients will roam between them. Since they're physically very close to each other, though, I don't expect you're going to see an appreciable quantity of roaming. 
Giving "Router B" an IP address in your LAN subnet would allow you manage it easily. There's nothing that's more "safe" about giving it some oddball IP address-- you're just making it harder to manage.
Play it safe from what? I don't see any inherent "danger" in assigning it an ip address in your existing subnet. If you want to manage it without having to jump through some hoops then assign it an ip address in your existing subnet. Ask him to explain, with context, what he means by "play it safe".
