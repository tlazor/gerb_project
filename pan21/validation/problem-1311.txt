Pressing ctrl-k used to take me to the plain vanilla version of Google's homepage. Apparently, this has changed, as of Firefox 31. Pressing ctrl-k now gets me to some sort of Firefox-branded wrapper around the Google search box. Is there a way to change this new behavior back to the old behavior?
From discussion on the Mozilla Support Forum, it appears that there is no way to make ctrl-k behave as it did in previous versions of Firefox; the logic is built in to the code.  Pressing ctrl-k did, and continues to, take you to the search window in the navigation toolbar.  If you have customized your nav toolbar to remove the search window, as I have, then ctrl-k, which used to be hard-wired to jump to google.com, is now hard-wired to jump to about:home. (This is what I referred to above as "some sort of Firefox-branded wrapper ...")
Why would I prefer plain google.com to do this, versus the about:home page, which also has the suggest-as-you-type behavior? For the Google Doodles. No other reason.
Why would I want to go to google.com and enter the search term there, rather than just append it to the smart keyword directly? Because sometimes I'm unsure of spelling, or phrasing, and I like to get the help of the drop-down suggestions.
Following the instructions at Mozilla Support's How to search IMDB, Wikipedia and more from the address bar, define g to point to the search window at google.com, and then instead of ctrl-k, do ctrl-l g.
