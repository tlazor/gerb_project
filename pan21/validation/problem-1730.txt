The answer will depend on the school it is being offered at. My university offered both programs, but the software engineering major focused on embedded systems design. That meant a number of traditional programming and design course as well as some electrical engineering courses too.
The question that should really make your decision is "which is the better school?"  When I'm reviewing resumes, I typically consider CS and SE degrees to be pretty much equivalent. I know the curricula differ, but not in any standard way between schools, and a high GPA in either degree serves the same purpose of imbecile-filtering.
The computer science major had two emphases, one in general programming and design, and one that focused on accounting (a lot of COBOL).
Since you're asking on the game development forum, I'm assuming you're interested in a game development career.  Both programs would be fine. They have some overlap, but they also would lead you in different directions.
Plenty of CS majors move into software engineering as they gain experience, but fewer people seem to move into CS after they've studied software engineering.

A traditional computer science program is aimed at the more theoretical aspects of computing. You'd generally work in more traditional languages (C/C++/Java) and you'd spend a lot of time contemplating data structures, algorithms, and efficiency. CS majors typically are required to take a great deal of Math and Science. (I encourage our students to get a Math minor, because they're only one course away by the time they take our requirements.)  The focus on math and theory are good preparation for certain kinds of game programming (say building game engines and creating lighting models.)  
So, in the end, when looking at a school, also look at the emphases offered and you can always ask the people there on career paths that the major can lead to.
Software engineering has a different focus. Software engineering programs are typically more focused on business applications. The emphasis is on working with large teams of developers and building large software projects.  Games are a form of business application, so the skills would be applicable.
