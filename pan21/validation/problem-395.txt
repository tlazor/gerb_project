Here is the gist of where I am going with this. I work for a printer company and basically all of our input files(or output files for virtual printers) are bitmap files. We currently have a tool built in java over 10 years ago that works, but chokes on our high end 1600x1600 files.
I am thinking all I would have to do is create a 1600x1600 plane, feed it the image file and draw the scene. I figure this is the easy part.
Most game engines do not support exotic image manipulations, so you may also be looking for a tool like Photoshop or The GIMP, though The GIMP is much more limited on color space options than Photoshop.
Since it also sounds like you may want mouse interaction (click on a particular pixel), it could also make sense to include a GUI interface, which could be built in Java like your current system, and could use ImageMagick in the back-end for efficient processing. 
ImageMagick has many tools for image manipulation built-in. I'm not sure what kinds of operations you want to perform, but I don't think you need a full-blown game engine to perform these manipulations. Based on your question, I'd recommend scripting ImageMagick for simple tasks.
However, the hard part is reaching into the image for example and clicking the mouse on a particular pixel. Getting RGB data, converting to CYMK, making changes, converting back into RGB and then redrawing the scene. Not only that but pulling the modified texture out of memory and saving it back into a bitmap.
