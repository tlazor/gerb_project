The meaning of the numbers in index0, index1, etc do not necessarily correspond to levels; they're just numbered. If you want to know what level cache it is, look at the level file. 1 means L1, 2 means L2, 3 means L3. They tend to be numbered lowest level to highest, but I don't know if there's any requirement of this.
To know whether L2 is shared, first determine which cache is L2. Then look at the shared_cpu_list for that cache. It will be startnumber-endnumber of the sharing. (I don't know what it looks like when it isn't shared because my computer only has shared caches, but I'd guess either just a single number or something like "0-0".) For example, on my quad-core, hyperthreaded Sandy Bridge, if I look at the L2's shared_cpu_list, I see "2-3", which tells me that it is shared with cpu2 (which is actually the same physical CPU because of hyperthreading, so it's not really a shared cache). 
On my machine, index0 has type Data, and index1 has type Instruction hence implying that that L1 cache for these two things is different, whereas they share L2 and L3 cache.
For my L3 cache, of which there is only one for all caches, I see "0-7", so I assume that means it's shared for all CPU's 0 through 7. I've never seen an underscore in one of those files though.
