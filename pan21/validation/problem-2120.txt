I believe system administrators just deem imap unnecessary considering that they'll have less issues if they allow only Exchange.
This being said, i usually connect to our exchange 2007 with the aid of software such as davmail, which allows me to use the clients that i find most suitable on my platform of choice. Without requiring that the admin gives me support for this. As you can imagine the IT admin would have much more work if it were to support both IMAP and exchange, with a wider range of possible configurations / clients, in addition to the aforementioned complications with features.
My opinion is that's it's probably due more to supportability than security. Enabling IMAP (and/or POP) means that the administrator has to manage several connection types to the Exchange server, which then inevitably increases the number of support calls from users and broadens the scope of managing and supporting those clients. A support call would consist of:
It is a greater maintenance burden insofar as I now have to monitor the Exchange IMAP service, and engage in troubleshooting issues with user connection.
In theory, yes, opening IMAP is a security vulnerability, as is opening any port on a firewall.  Somewhere there may be an exploit that uses IMAP to attack Exchange.  I've never seen one, but one may exist.
It's also a better way to make sure that everyone will have access to all the features (calendars, meetings, folders, etc) that exchange provides. (not that they are impossible to provide via IMAP, just that there are several implementations to those services, as opposed to the integrated solution provided by Exchange and it's main clients, Outlook and mobile devices.
The main reason is likely that they have decided on Outlook or Outlook Web Access as the only supported client, which can make sense in some environments. 
Testing for client side firewalls that may be blocking that connection type (IMAP and/or POP ports, not to mention SMTP for sending email)
