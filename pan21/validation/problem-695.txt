Most people worry about the fact that their data is unencrypted - but imagine no longer being able to trust an HTTP server's response.  It would be trivial to inject a response with the correct SEQ and ACK, IP src, dst, ports, etc. in time before the server responds with the valid data, since you're so much closer.  Once the client ACK's your fake packets, it's going to cause some trouble, but I can see a small GIF or IM being accepted as legit with no ARP poisoning or anything like that...
I may be misunderstanding something, but wouldn't TCP stream injection be terribly easy on an unencrypted LAN?  My University's campus-wide WiFi is unencrypted (bad, I know) and all I have to do is bring up Wireshark and I can see a crapload of TCP sessions and exactly what their current sequence numbers are.
The only problem I can think of is that in 802.11 Managed Mode, all packets must be sent to the AP first, so maybe the router would see the fake source IP, notice it is outside of the network and drop it.
