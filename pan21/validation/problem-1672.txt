If you coupled it with something like nemesis from http://nemesis.sourceforge.net/; this tool can be used to craft packets to inject but also to re-send captured packets so, in theory, you could use your method to generate the test packet, capture it, then re-use it with nemesis and monitor at the far end to see if it comes through, saving the hassle of installing and configuring a card capable of vlan tagging. If that worked you could quite easily build a script around the pre-captured packet and nemesis, then either listen for it at the far end with wire shark, or listen for an icmp response at the near end (if the far end is configured for VLANs).
I guess another option would be to use a packet sniffing software package like wireshark from http://www.wireshark.org/ to monitor the traffic at both ends, this way ensure you see the data coming through, though it won't allow you to create a full-size packet for the test. 
This method is completely untested as I have never used nemesis, but it is listed on the wireshark site as a useful and fairly well supported packet injection tool.
