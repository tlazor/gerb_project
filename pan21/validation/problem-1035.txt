Your RAM configuration ought to be plenty, per Microsoft's planning guide's formula (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb738142.aspx), but more accurate planning could be had by working up some sizing based on your existing E2K3 install.
a. if you continue with public folders users will usually try to get more created- then you're back to the "new to pf" column, and, generally speaking of course, sharepoint is usually your best option.
Our exchange server has 1GB of memory and we have 373 fully active heavy usage email accounts. Unless you are trying to give each user unlimited amount of storage 16GB memory is overkill. 
b. It's likely you either have, or will have, a sharepoint server, in which case you'll likely be maintaining the same type of information in 2 disparate systems, which from a business process standpoint is not exactly optimal.
Then you need to make sure your 'autodiscover' stuff is in place for 2007. I can't remember exactly what this is off the top of my head, but there is some DNS stuff that needs doing.
We did it in batches over about a week. The users didn't even notice. When they move they get the new OWA. If they're already on Outlook 2007 some features will start working that weren't working before. 
Microsoft seems to think that you want more cores, as opposed to higher clock speeds. I tend to agree, but I can't base that on anything other than anecdotal observation of performance. Exchange has always done a great job of taking advantage of multiple CPUs, and I can't imagine that E2K7 is an exception.
We set up our full 2007 environment in parallel to our 2003 environment before we moved any real users over to the 2007 servers. This allowed us to get the 2007 servers into the 2003's routing group so mail would correctly deliver between the two environments. Next, I believe we cut over OWA to the 2007 servers; users on 2003 would still get the 2003 OWA and when we moved them over to 2007 would automatically get the 2007 version of OWA.
As for RAM, we have between 4000 to 4500 users and both of our mailbox servers are at 8GB of RAM. We're working. Since you have an order of magnitude less users you should be just fine with less memory.
There is no option to "pre-build" if you're going to go the "cutover" route. You can't have both an E2K3 and an E2K7 organization freestanding in the same AD forest.
A move-mailbox migration is your friend, and it's not complicated at all. You can stage everything while the E2K3 server computers are in production and migrate away from them as time allows. Your routing group topology sounds pretty straightforward (>smile<) so it won't be a big deal to mail routing going as you bring E2K7 online.
Supporting Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2003 simultaneously isn't a problem. Technically Outlook 2000 isn't "supported" by Microsoft. I've never tried it and I've never heard from someone who has. I'd be wary of expecting that it would work and I'd test it. Supposedly as long as there's a public store available Outlook 2000 will work. 
Keeping your old E2K3 machines to host public folders is certainly a possibility. If not, replicate the public folders to the new public stores you create and, as you've said, specify the default public store for each private store. 
"There are many advantages with moving to SharePoint for your collaboration, content management and business process needs.  In contrast, not all Public Folder usage scenarios are best served by SharePoint.  Consider the strengths of each server, and the factors listed above, when making this decision.  A very realistic option for moving to SharePoint, is to deploy SharePoint in your organization today.  Begin integrating it into your organizations workflow, and slowly reduce your reliance on Exchange Public Folders."
There are some gotchas in removing the 2003 servers from your environment. Be careful about this. We missed a step, and I still don't know what step that was, that made things like delegates stop working and Entourage users start griping. It all started when we removed the 2003 routing group. So, read up on that and don't be like us. Otherwise, you and the LegacyExchangeDN will become dear friends.
I wanted to edit that those are full time employee email accounts, we have a couple hundred of which we call light to almost inactive accounts. Less than 2MB which is nothing these days, its like they arent even using the accounts.
Outlook Anywhere works fine in E2K7. I don't know what to say about using Outlook Anywhere company-wide. I'm not aware of a comparison of bandwidth usage between MAPI on the wire versus MAPI inside of HTTP, and I think that would give you the answer. You could certainly mock it up and benchmark it with something like Wireshark. (Gee... another one of those "maybe I should do that sometime" ideas. I've been getting a lot of those since I've started posting on here...)
I'd agree almost entirely with Evan's response. I'd have a couple different takes on some things.  I'd differ about outlook 2000.  I'd make sure those were upgraded before I moved those users over to 2007.  I'd differ when it comes to public folders.  You didn't mention what was stored in the public folders. Depending on what's being stored there you should consider moving it to sharepoint.  Here is a guidance post on what to and not to move to sharepoint right off the bat.  Even though the guidance says "no need to move" alot, I'd still consider it an option because
