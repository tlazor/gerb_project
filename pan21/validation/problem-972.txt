"GPIOR1" is another register in the registers list. It is a "General Purpose" I/O register, not tied to physical pins, used to send data to an I/O register like "Port B"
Microprocessor CPU's can only communicate with the outside world through I/O pins. There are several ways that the internal logic of the Microprocessor can do this: there may be an internal bus, there may be memory access commands which implicitly use pins connected to an external address and data bus, there may be explicit commands for setting the values of specific pins. One common way is to have logic representing registers, the values of which control the meaning, state, and value of the I/O pins. These "registers" (which commonly are actual physical registers) are I/O registers.
"PortB" is the logical representation of 8 I/O pins. It is the name of a Register in the Register List, and in the text is called an I/O register. 
In normal usage, an "I/O register" is a register which is part of a microprocessor, and is physically attached to the I/O pins of the microprocessor.
