If you host has other clients that are spammers and they don't do anything about it, your whole IP block might get marked as spam. In this case, you can also use external SMTP servers (including GMail) but you usually set this up on a per-application basis.
As for sending email, install postfix and sendmail. Set it up as a local only system, so it's only listening on localhost. This will stop people using you as an open relay and getting your IP marked as spam.
If you have to send mail in bulk (not spam, but things like customer opt-in mailing lists) you may want to use a service to do this, as getting on an anti-spam list is easy, and getting off them is hard.  I've used www.icontact.com before with good results.
Just to be clear, there's nothing inherently wrong with sending email through postfix. It usually gets there and unless you're doing big business through automated emails, you'll probably be fine sending email directly from your server.
Use google until there is a reason not to.  If you are sending mail only, perhaps it is easier to use your own box, perhaps not.  One advantage of using Google's outgoing SMTP server is that you are less likely to be spam-filtered by the remote end.  The disadvantage is that it is harder to use than a local one, perhaps.  You also rely on connecting to Google's servers, which is quite likely not an issue.
This certainly isn't an ignorant fear. Open postfix and spamd processes taking up too many system resources are the bain of my existence. When I adopt clients and I'm troubleshooting their servers' lack of resources, I try and move as many of them to third party services as possible.
For example, a Django webapp of mine connects to gmail for SMTP and this is set up in the Django configuration. This is just so I can guarantee emails send and I get a copy in the gmail accounts Sent Mail box. Another site uses another client's email provider (Message Labs) and that's fine too. Everything else on that server uses sendmail+postfix.
Don't touch incoming email. Let somebody else do it. Set up an account with Google for domains (or one of the billions of other providers) and let them worry about security, spam, webmail, uptime, etc. GMail for domains is pretty awesome but it does mean you have to trust Google with quite a lot of your data.
