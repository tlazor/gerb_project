Partitions basically split up one disk into multiple smaller virtual disks, each with its own drive letter. There would be no reason to partition the 1TB drive. If the backup software you use CANNOT restore only one drive from a backup, you can run multiple backups (one of each drive) and restore only one backup. This would still not require yuou to partition the 1TB drive.
If you make images of each drive instead of just copying data, you can restore whichever one you choose separately. There is no need to partition the 1TB drive, just make separate folders for each backup to sort them. Ghost and Acronis True Image are the commercial top dogs right now it seems, for a free solution check out DriveImage XML.
It depends on the backup software you use, but with some (and probably most) software, you wouldn't need to do anyhtnig special to allow the software to restore only one drive. Most software backs up on a per-drive basis (or per-file), and this makes it possible to restore only one drive.
