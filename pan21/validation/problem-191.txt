If you dd correctly (A hard drive to hard drive). It should boot. I have done this before without the system booted and it has worked successfully because the MBR and everything else is preserved. Doing it with the system booted will just cause the new drive to be in the state as if you have forced shutdown the computer (as if you held the powerbutton down).  As for formatting the extra space, this is what I have done:
Your best bet is probably to partition the new 1TB drive: set up a small partition and install a minimal OS on it, boot from that, then image the old drive to the larger partition of the new drive.
It might boot, it might not. As you already figured, it's a bad idea. The contents of the disk might be changing as you read it.
This should work. Also, you shouldn't lose any data if this doesn't work (dont mess up the commands though), just reformat the 1TB Drive.
I would rather try to set up a working system on the second drive while your system is running. Then boot into that new system and copy over the data.
Whether it boots or not (and it probably won't), you won't have a working system if you use dd this way.
