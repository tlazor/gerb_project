I do this a lot, always involuntarily, when trying to insert a new row or a new cell before pasting my cell or range or cell. 
This answer may not be as thorough as Michael's, but one little change to your habit could make a big difference. Assuming there's nothing else to the left or right of the data you're copying, you should select the rows rather than the cell range before copying. When you paste that, the inserted rows will look identical to the ones you copied; nothing will be auto-filled across the empty cells.
Excel has a behavior that I guess has been purposefully designed but which has made me lose quite a lot of time over the years. This behavior happens after the following steps:
Of course, one solution would be to never insert something that you don't want to insert (duh) but that is actually not that easy and I know some of my colleagues sometimes make the mistake as well.
This is very annoying because it sometimes take quite a bit of processing power to process the entire row(s) of pasted stuff, especially when it contains formulas; and it takes even more time to Ctrl + Z for some reason (cancelling the insertion of an entire row of pasted formulas often makes the computer freeze for a few seconds, and has even, on some occasions, caused Excel to crash altogether). There have been literally zero occasion of which I have triggered this behavior purposefully. 
When this happens, the cell or range is inserted not once but across the entire line or column, e.g. if I have selected a 2x2 range and insert in on one row, it will be repeated until the end of the row. 
It does look like a dumb design decision to me, especially since there's no way to insert blank rows at all via the context menu while there's something in the clipboard.
