I've created a certificate successfully in the Certificate Manager. I set up a ELB with a "target" group that seemed to be right, and hooked it up to the certificate. When I try to add https:// in front of my host, it says the server refuses to connect. When I go into the ELB itself and access the URL it gives me for the ELB, I get an Error 503 Service Temporarily Available.
I run an Amazon AWS setup for a web page I host. It uses a single EC2 instance, and works fine over HTTP. But recently I have a need to also offer up HTTPS. And this is where I'm totally confused. The EC2 instance is running Apache, PHP, and MySQL on a Linux
I somewhat get (in the abstract) how HTTPS works in the non-AWS world. (I've never done it.) But I gather that isn't the best way to do it with AWS, which seems to involve setting up something in the Certificate Manager and then hooking up an Elastic Load Balancer to it. I'm kind of at a loss.
I think I may just not be understanding this right, and the AWS/HTTPS posts on here all seem to assume you know what you're trying to accomplish. Could someone just lay it out for me how these things (the certificate, the ELB, the EC2 instance, and Apache) are all meant to be linked together? Thank you.
