I am helping with documentation for a hardware product that is compatible with Fat32 Formatted USB sticks. Instead of saying "Fat32" and confusing users who may not be tech-savvy, we'd like to provide a list of compatible drives and brands. 
No, because such a relationship doesn't exist. Flash drives are block devices, and do not have any concept of supporting any one filesystem. One could just as easily format a flash drive as BTRFS or NTFS as they could FAT32, and none of those have anything to do with the chipset on a given flash drive.
Rather than researching each product separately, we hope that there is a smaller set of USB Controller Chips that determine the drive format, and that there might be a mapping from a few of these (e.g. "Fat32" controller chips) to products currently use them.
If your product demands FAT32 to function, you must ensure that FAT32 is used on whatever block device you're using. If you're looking for pre-formatted FAT32 devices, you'd have to review the provided documentation for a given product to determine whether it comes that way.
