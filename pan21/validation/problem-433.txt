Sounds like a network bottleneck to me. I've seen behavior like this when a process is bogging down the network with a big load (ie backing up to an iscsi drive using the same router as the rest of the network).
Do you have any way to monitor the traffic your network / router is receiving at any given time? I would also advise checking the load (and speed) of the NIC on the server you're describing as there may be an issue with the hardware there. I've seen a bad cable screw up the auto-negotiate speed and set it to 10/100 instead of 10/100/1000 Mbps before so take that into consideration as well.
We didn't do any modification to the server, but for some reasons PCs have problems holding a connection with it. Even tho the server is managing the loggings, they stay connected. When they lose connection, i feel like it's just for about a second, and then it goes back on. For exemple : they connect to the server, see their documents, browse, and when say open something, it hangs. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
