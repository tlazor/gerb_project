Doing such a synchronization would be incredibly difficult - vibration, temperature, natural power supply fluctuation, etc. all have small effects on the platter rotational speed (and if you want to be REALLY picky, the size of a sector).
If you ever go down and use the never used RAID-2 where data is striped at the bit level, it required disks to be synched. No one I know ever used it, but, technically, if a RAID controller supports RAID2, it would need to be able to synch platter rotation. This would be the only need to have it now a days.
You would need to constantly vary the speed of the disk spindle motor by infinitesimal amounts to maintain synchronization, which would require very precise (very expensive) motor controls, and lots of disk controller overhead to determine the current platter position of each drive.  As there's little to no practical benefit from doing this it's not worth the silicon and time.
(This idea also completely falls apart if you think outside the box of rotating rust media -- Solid State Disks have no seek time or spindle speed: Reads are effectively constant time for any sector, and there's nothing to "synchronize".)
