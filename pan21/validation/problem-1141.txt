I've seen this happen when there's a bad spot in the first dimm or low in the addressing scheme of the second.  I've also seen this when the system has a non bootable thumbdrive attached and the system is set (bios setup) to boot from usb devices before hard drives.  I've also seen it when an attached external storage usb device has gone bad. this could be an external backup disk, or sometimes a printer that has usb disk emulation software like the hp p1606dn.  So detach anything usb other than mouse and keyboard. then power up.  if this fails you, then try unplugging the power, removing dimm 1 and dimm 2 and moving dimm 3 and dimm 4 to the slots for dimm 1 and dimm 2 before powering back up.  good luck.
I took out the memory (RAM) card, blew on the slot to remove the dust and reseated the card. This resolved the issue for me 
I have a computer, a Dell Optiplex 755, that turns itself on whenever it is being supplied power. It turns on, and all the lights come on, the fans spin, and the monitor does recieve input, but it's just a black screen. I get no noises or beeps or a POST or a BIOS, I get absolutely nothing, just a computer that looks like it should work but doesn't.
