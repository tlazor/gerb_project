If you've named your Active Directory example.org then you cannot prevent this. You've gone against Microsft's best practices for naming an AD and you're seeing one of the symptoms.
I have been able to do this by making a CNAME first then setup the servers, wait a day for the DNS records to propogate
So, I don't know if this evaded anyone else, but the best fix for this issue may just be getting a secondary domain with a different suffix, especially if you cannot PortProxy because of Exchange being on the DC(or because of hostheaders issues with your web host.)
You can do the redirection with an URL redirect (HTTP 301 code), IIS 7 can do that for you, or you can install a reverse proxy (Apache for Windows) and use the following code :
I've blogged about AD naming best practices multiple times and link to official Microsoft sources. You should read them:
