I have a similar setup, I generally have a lot of open windows.  I can't imagine life with out the alt+mouseLeft window move and alt+mouseright window resize.  There is a windows port of this capability called WinMover.
I'm slightly amused.  I've also got two wide-screen monitors and find myself wishing for more space.  I guess I just fill up all that space with lots of applications that I use for my work.  I suppose if all your doing is browsing the web, not many sites are catering to widescreen yet.
*at least, programs stopped being easier to use maximised. It's still great for those times you just need a little extra space.
Wide screen is very good for watching movies on VLC or Youtube, and even though I have one 1680*1050 moniter I still find myself running out of space.
You're thinking "How can I modify existing software to better use a widescreen monitor", when really you should be thinking How can I now use my computer more efficiently. Stop maximizing. Maximizing stopped being useful about 5 years ago*, we have screen resolutions in the 1000s of pixels both ways now, and enough hardware to run countless programs at the same time. 
Start using multiple applications at the same time! Wheras before you might have a document on the secondary screen to refer to while you work on the primary, have both on one, and then use the secondary for either even more reference material, or something completely different (I keep IRC channels always-open, cover them up with the docs to whatever language I'm using at the moment, so I can look up functions and arcane chants very quickly).
Perhaps try sidebar software, such as Desktop Sidebar, Google Desktop, or Vista/7's built in sidebar. Join Twitter, and keep a client always-open to keep track of news and current events. Basically, a widescreen monitor, in the right hands, is a wonderful thing.
On windows 7, use Aero Snap, on Vista and below use software such as GridMove or a suitable Autohotkey script (It's really not my area, but AHK serves my needs brilliantly)
Buy a 5 button mouse, you're spending lots on your output, so you should beef up your input. Autohotkey, or software such as Logitech's SetPoint, can empower additional buttons, or combinations, to help you with your workflow.
