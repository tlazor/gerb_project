Normally in a filterchain the first output of each filter becomes the first input of the next in the chain. However, the paletteuse filter expects the video to be its first input, with the 'palette' as its second input -- this is part of why you can't just use palettegen,paletteuse. The [0:v] uses FFmpeg's stream selection syntax (see here for some examples of its use) to tell paletteuse to take video from the first input file (FFmpeg starts counting from 0 for most things) as its first input.
...and it would work just as well (assuming only one video stream amongst inputs). But I think that labelling the palettegen output and explicitly telling it where to go makes things a bit clearer to follow.
Basically, the palettegen filter takes a single video input (so as long as you don't have more than one video stream amongst your inputs you don't need to specify where the input is) and gives out one video (well, image) output; meanwhile, paletteuse takes two video inputs (well, a video and an image). 
I've never used WinFF, but it looks like you just need to put all the FFmpeg options between the  tags? So, this should work:
