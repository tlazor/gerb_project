The problem is that previously I was able to play games that were fairly graphics intensive (for a mid-tier laptop) without problem. Suddenly, they began to chug along at 1-10 frames per second. I haven't noticed significant performance drops in other areas. The performance drop was sudden and coincident with a plane flight (but other than the performance problems, I have no reason to suspect physical damage). I've seen several error message about insufficient video memory since these problems started.
I'm trying to determine which piece of hardware is causing my ASUS Q550LF laptop to fail. I don't want to open the laptop, because it's still under the manufacturer's warranty, and might attempt to return it. Various hardware monitoring tools report consistent results that lead me to believe that the problem isn't simply a dislodged memory stick, or something of that nature.
I don't seem to be able to generate any consistent error message that would let me pinpoint the source of the problem, and the laptop's GeForce 745M has no diagnostic tools. What is the best way to determine the nature of the problem?
