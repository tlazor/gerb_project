But I would recommend that you don't do this and instead are diligent with your transactions in Management Studio. Any window that I ever started a transaction in gets closed when I am done. And if there's still an open transaction in it, SSMS will warn me about it so that I can commit/rollback. 
I did find that I could change my workflow a bit that seems to hold some merit and might appeal to some people better. Instead of commenting out a section of the code, you can use this base instead.
You can use sp_WhoIsActive to find open transactions that are causing blocking, though it'll take a bit of work. 
You could create a job that checks for open transactions and kills them if they've been open for a period of time and are causing blocking. But you'd have to be careful with this as you could have a large, necessary transaction that takes a while that you don't want to get killed. Imagine rolling back an index rebuild that's been running for an hour on Standard Edition. 
The workflow would be that instead of commenting out the ROLLBACK TRAN, you would instead add the COMMIT TRAN right above the IF statement. Though it still doesn't fix the problem if you do not hight the code.
