I have chosen 2 applications to assist me. 1. AppGini and PHPMaker. Both are very affordable and worth checking out.
What is the best way to go about this? Are there any similar programs to AppGini or utilities that I'm not familiar with that might be able to do this for me?
For example; I might only want to see "Name", "Description", "Administrative Contact" but another person might need "Name", "Services", "Stack", "Ports" - I hope that makes sense. We all need to see something different.
IE, it's a really wide spreadsheet, lots of columns. A lot of that data is not needed and would be annoying on a webpage (nobody wants to scroll left to right in a browser) The pages that AppGini generates can't give custom views.
My team is looking to build a rich inventory of servers at our enterprise. We are trying to consolidate several different excel documents into one database.
I found a great utility called AppGini (http://bigprof.com/appgini/) that can generate some pretty sweet material in short order. Our only problem is we might end up having 40 potential fields for each server...
