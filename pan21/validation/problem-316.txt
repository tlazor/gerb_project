The only time it should take more than the TTL to update would be if you're changing records with your registrar. Usually, a registrar will update records once or twice every 24 hours. Normally, however, these records are the ones that point your domain to your DNS servers. 
If you are updating normal (A, PTR, CNAME, etc...) records on your DNS servers, and they're running bind, you should be able to do an "rndc reload domain.name" (or "rndc reload domain.name IN view") to schedule an immediate update. 
depends on dns ttl record. one week sounds quite long. try checking what are answers for dns queries from all responsible servers - visit for instance http://www.squish.net/dnscheck/ , type your domain name, select type: ANY and run the check. 
One weekis more than enough time for any propagation to happen. I had similar issue and problem was that primary and secondary server weren't syncronised. I used nslookup to check current status. While my problem was with MX records, you may want to check it.
One last caveat, browsers maintain their own cache, as well as the OS's DNS client. I've been frustrated more than once by an apparent lack of update when all I really needed to do was "ipconfig /flushdns" on the Windows client.
