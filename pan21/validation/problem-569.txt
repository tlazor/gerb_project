There may be an excess of blank rows or columns in the larger file. If this is the case, the larger file will have a much lager scroll-able area and much smaller scroll bars (along the right and bottom edges of the window). 
Now save the document. Once saved, the scroll bars should return to the appropriate size, the scrollable area should now include only the area of the spreadsheet that contains data, and the size of the file should decrease.
