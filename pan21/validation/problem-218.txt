Go to Properties of folder, go to security tab and assign a permission as required to user. This should resolve your issue.
You've got two sets of permissions to worry about-- the underlying NTFS filesystem permissions (accessible via the "Security" tab of the "Properties" sheets of the shared folder) and the "Share Permissions" (accessible in Windows Server 2003 from the "Permissions..." button on the "Sharing" tab of the "Properties" sheets of the shared folder).
I'd set "SYSTEM / Full Control", "Administrators / Full Control", and "AccessGroup / Modify" (unless you need members of "AccessGroup" to be able to set permissions, in which case I'd give them "Full Control".)
I'd recommend granting access via NTFS permissions only and leaving "Share Permissions" set to "Everyone / Full Control". The most restrictive combination of both permissions applies, but there's no advantage to setting restrictive permissions in both. (The "Share Permissions" comes from a time when the underlying filesystem might be one that doesn't have any permissions, like FAT.)
Once you've done that you should see users who are members of the "AccessGroup" group as being able to access the share and read, write, and modify files and folders there.
