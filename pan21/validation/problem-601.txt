First, as mentioned, your assumption is wrong: you can install software offline in Ubuntu, or any other Linux variant that I know of. (Edge cases may exist, but not to my knowledge.)
If you do the proper research, such as checking package dependencies, you can download the .deb files (for Ubuntu, or .rpm files for RedHat) and then install all the needed packages offline. It is a lot of work, and if you miss something you have to go back and download that and install it. Once you are done, it still works, and it was all installed offline.
Why the differences? Mostly because of philosophy. In the Linux philosophy, which was inherited from Unix, is the concept of do one thing, and do it well. So the installer for a package doesn't have to know how to install, and link, and test, all of the helper libraries it needs, only check if they are where they are supposed to be. Firefox's installer doesn't have to install OpenSSL to check website certificates for HTTPS, it only has to know that it has, or does not have, access to it.
What happens if you install five media players in Linux? Pretty much the same thing. If you use the package manager, and watch as it progresses, you'll even see the long list of helper files installed with the first player, a much shorter list with the second one, and probably none on the fifth one.
Looking at two packages that have a Unundu .deb and a Windows .exe or .msi to compare head-to-head, we get:
The proper question is either "why shouldn't I ... ?" or "why isn't the vlc package for Ubuntu complete?" Both depend on the basics behind the other. So, lets start with what the situation is.
Comparing the sizes of the packages for those two players, it's about ten times as much downloaded for Windows over Linux. Obviously some programs will be even worse, and others will be better. For example, to install Perl, using Strawberry Perl, on Windows, I download an 84.3 MB .msi file. To install in Linux I can download the source at 15.6 MB, which is only one-fifth the size.
All that work is what the package manager for a distribution takes care of for you. If you needed to install every dependency for that package, you have to download all of them first. In Windows, if you want to install a package, you also have to download all of its dependencies before you install it as well. The difference is that the Windows installer has bundled all those dependencies into a single downloaded file, while Linux has each package in it's own file.
So, what's the difference? None, right? Wrong. All five Windows installers will hold all the helper files. So you will have downloaded five copies of the MP3 codec, five copies of the WMA codec, 5 copies of the FLAC codec, five copies of the window manager interface, etc., and etc. In Linux, on the other hand, you will have downloaded one copy of each helper file, not five, and your bandwidth usage will be smaller. If you save the installers for later, then you also have much less disk space used. In addition, many of the helper files may already be installed, so you won't have downloaded, or saved, any of those.
Another part of Linux philosophy is choice. That's part of why there are so many distributions of Linux to choose from, and why you can install so many different window managers, and other programs. You can also choose which MP3 codec you want to use, and there are both Open Source and Proprietary versions to choose from.
When you get a package to install in Linux, it includes that program exclusively. None of the other things it might need are included. If VLC player needs an MP3 codec installed, then you have to install that as well, or VLC won't play MP3 files. The same applies to any other dependencies that the package might list.
If you must install offline, use the package manager to do the sorting, sifting and selecting for you. Just tell it not to install the files, only download them. Then you can go offline and do the install yourself. If you want to get more adventuristic in your installs, download the original source tarballs and compile the packages. You'll probably get a better performance as a bonus. You can use the saved disk space for more music, videos, and games, if you like. To really go onto the "Wild Side," try creating your own Linux from the ground up, including compiling the kernel itself. Linux from Scratch is such a project, will all the steps worked out for you. But, do this on a spare computer, since it will not be an overnight install, and once done, you will still have to do even more to get back the the windowed GUI that you are used to.
Now, what happens if you install five different media players in Windows? Almost all the media players will need the same basic set of libraries in the system, such as an MP3 codec, an interface to the sound system, an interface to the window manager, and a way to read files from the filesystem, etc. If you install VLC first, it will install all those helpers, since nothing else has installed them yet. Then, when you install Banshee, most of the helper files are already installed. Therefore, the installer has very little to do except find them and create the links to them for that program. By the time you've installed the last player, whatever it is, there's a very good chance that every helper file needed is already there, and installation goes real fast.
All that being said, there are a few cases where someone has created a bundle to install, in one step, some package or other. One that comes to mind right away is Mail-in-a-Box. Even that, however, still needs to installed online, since it will do what a package manager does in looking for, and downloading as needed, the other libraries that make it work. It still does not "bundle" everything into one download.
When you get a package to install in Windows it includes everything needed to install that package: drivers, subsystems, supporting libraries (DLLs), etc. When you run the installer it looks at the system to see what's needed and what's not, hopefully only installing the ones needed, and not overwriting any similar files used by other packages. Since everything needed is included, one download does it all. If your system doesn't have the MP3 codec VLC expects installed, then the one included in the downloaded package is installed. Even if you have a different MP3 codec, that VLC isn't written to use, you still get the other one from VLC's installer.
