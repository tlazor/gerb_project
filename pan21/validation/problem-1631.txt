Nope.  The BIOS's job is to determine what disk is bootable, and then run code in the boot loader.  The boot loader's main job is to figure out what partition has code that needs to run, and run it.  (If the boot loader gives you choices, it may be called a boot manager.)  Then the code in the partition runs.
Hopefully things are simple: the code in the partition runs the operating system.  It is possible for things to be more complex: code in the partition could act like a boot manager/loader, and run code from somewhere else.
If you screw up the boot process, it can be restored.  Restoring the boot process can be a bit unpleasant, as this often involves booting from something other than your hard drive, and possibly using disk-specializing tools that might not have the easier user interfaces.  However, restoring the boot process (if the operating systems are left in tact) is really a fairly small amount of data to be written (as in, a small number of clusters... maybe hundreds of kilobytes, or maybe even so few kilobytes that you can count them with your fingers).
