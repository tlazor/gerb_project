This is often a persistent network drive mapping using an old password (from another user's workstation perhaps).
Therefore I am thinking that there must be a service, or some application, that has held on to his credentials (possible old?) and is trying to access the network in someway thus triggering the lockout event.
Rather than log-diving (as suggested by the other answer thus far), I prefer to use the Account Lockout Tools from Microsoft.  
The Client Adress line will inform you from which client/server the logon attempt came from. (in this example 172.17.xx.xx ) 
On the Active Directory Server the users uses to logon with you will find an entry in the Security Eventlog.
I can see that the reason for the lockout is a failed number of password attempts. However, the user is not failing any attempts when he unlocks his system. 
At the very least, it's immensely helpful in showing me which Domain Controller to go log-diving on.
One on my users is being locked out of his Active Directory account on a daily basis. This occurs between 10 and 18 hours after each reset.
Are there any tools that I can use to tell me what computer these failed logins are coming from? Is there anything you can recommend to further troubleshoot this issue? It has become very frustrating.
(And yes, it does work on Server 2008 R2, even though it was originally developed for 2000 and 2003.)
