While the question is tagged with iis-7, this is the top hit when searching on X-Forwarded-For and IIS so I thought I would go ahead and provide this information for IIS 8.5.
IIS 8.5 introduced the Enhanced Logging feature that easily allows the administrator to log HTTP request headers such as X-Forwarded-For. This answer is adapted from the linked page.
This isn't built into IIS, but there is a module you can install that will perform this functionality. It is called ARR helper, but it will work for any proxy in front of IIS:
(note: I'm a linux admin, not a windows one, so explicit instructions & links are sincerely appreciated)
Note that the total size of data collected from all custom fields cannot exceed 65,536 bytes. If the total exceeds 65,536 bytes, then IIS will truncate the data.

Once the custom fields have been configured, IIS will create new text log files with "_x" appended to the file name to indicate that the file contains custom fields.
The reverse proxy is sending the standard "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR" header with the visitor IP address, but IIS7 logging is only logging the IP address of the nginx server (which makes sense, but it's not what I want).
