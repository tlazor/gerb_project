Visit System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts and smack the "Restore Defaults" button.  
Another potential cause of this problem is if you have changed your keyboard language. I use two different languages and it changes the location of the tilde key.
Have the same problem. In my case problem is in the keyboard settings: ยง shown then I press ` on my keyboard. This is because of I choose ISO (European) in System settings -> Keyboard -> Change keyboard type wizard. Just change it to ANSI (USA and others) and ` returns.
Make sure your keyboard language preference is English. If you use different keyboard languages, the tilde key will change. 
Change your keyboard back to normal language or use the key location of tilde in whatever keyboard you're using.
If you need keep ISO (European) just reassign shortcut move focus to next window to command-ยง (find shortcut, click on existing key combination and press on keyboard command-ยง/`).
A sure fire way to get that working again (barring something strange) is to restore the default keyboard shortcuts.
