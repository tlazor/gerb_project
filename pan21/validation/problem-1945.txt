however, Thats ONLY the backup side, dont forget about recovery. I'd purchase a second server in a second datacenter, have similar builds, and rsync the changes nightly.
You may also want to look into JungleDisk as well.  There service basically adds decent encryption and interface/app to S3 allowing for realtime data backup.
An S3 account isn't impractical for that size of data set -- at 10Mbps, it'll take about 9 hours to transfer all that data.  Whatever you do, though, think about recovery -- are you OK with being down for the 9 hours (on top of whatever provisioning time you need for your new machine) it takes to download your 30GB of data back onto your server?  Keep an eye on your data set growth, too, and keep re-evaluating that choice.  At some point, it may make sense to find someone who's willing to ship you physical media (a bunch of DVDs or a USB hard drive), but for now a purely network-accessable system should suit you fine.
I'd probably say rsync with your Amazon S3, but keep in mind that its 30gb, so bandwidth costs will be high (if you pay 95%) and it'll take a long time to get your initial push up there.   Once your data is up there just keep the files rsynced nightly / weekly / whatever your preference is.
