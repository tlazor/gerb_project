Typically, when two different companies own the facilities involved in the proposed cross-connect, one company provides a letter of authorizarion (LOA) authorizing the other company to order the cross connect to a specific connecting facility assignment (CFA, which is the patch panel connection, port, channel, VLAN, etc., where the other side of the proposed circuit terminates).  The vendor will not create a cross-connect that is not authorized by the owner of record of the individual facilities involved (the copper, fiber, or coax of lower layer interconnections... or the ports/channels/timeslots/VLANs, etc. of higher-layer interconnections).
Similarly, if both companies A and B have existing Ethernet connections to ports A and B on the vendor's Ethernet switch, and they request that the vendor enable VLAN 694 on both port A to port B, then that is also a cross-connect, but a virtual one.
Note that facility, here, does not mean a building or partition, and does not refer to a collocation enclosure (rack or cage)... it refers, instead, to a layer 0 entity, such as a single run of fiber, coax, or copper, that spans the desired endpoints of one leg of the complete circuit (physical cross-connect)... or to another low layer entity, such as an Ethernet port or VLAN on a port, a SONET or DSX timeslot, an ATM PVC, etc. (virtual cross-connect).
Cross connects had mainly been on copper (Cat5e/6 etc.) but recently a large amount are on OM3 50/125 fibre cables to carry the bandwidth.
If tenants A and B both have copper or fiber Ethernet facilities from patch panels in their enclosures to the data center operator's frame, and they want the operator to connect them together, only the data center operator's patch cable is considered the cross-connect.  The wire or fiber (facilities) used by those circuits between the tenant patch panels and the vendor patch panels are part of the circuit that is completed by the cross-connect, but they are not properly considered part of the cross-connect.  Those individual customers will also need to install patch cables within their enclosures if their equipment is not already pre-wired, but while these might also be referred to as cross-connects, they are not cross-connects in the sense that is relevant, here.
In a collocation environment, the collo vendor typically has home-run facilities connecting its distribution frame to all the tenant enclosures, and when a cross-connect is ordered, this involves the vendor installing a patch on their frame to connect two existing facilities -- it does not involve running an actual new line all the way from customer A to customer B.  If no spare facilities are in place to support the desired circuit, those would typically need to be ordered separately.  Circuits on facilities that run directly, physically, from tenant to tenant and are physically installed and reconfigured would be a problematic disarray of problems waiting to happen.  Facilites terminating to a common frame under the collo vendor's control allow proper recordkeeping, security, and test access for troubleshooting. 
Many of these answers contain some excellent information, but several of them contain what seems to me like an element of confusion.
I have been doing some research on Datacenters and this is one of term that i have yet to wrap my mind around. I would appreciate if someone in the field could explain in simple terms what exactly does it mean.
Cross Connects are simply a link from a carrier or ISP to customers suite or rack to provide services. Most DC's have more information on them on the web page.
