RF Field Engineer - If you have any electrical or RF experience, this is a tangent field that has a lot of positions that take you out and about.  Cable and and Wireless technologies need engineers out and about to service, implement, and troubleshoot lines and equipment.  While not traditionally "IT", it's a similar sort of mindset.
Hmmm... End user support or break-fix probably keeps you on your feet: visiting users, printers, etc.
As to "the get it done now"...  This is likely part of being in a IT position from time to time.  It should however not be the norm.  If it is the norm, I would recommend one of two things depending on the situation.  The first would be to a look for a job where things are not out of control and all you do it put out fires.  The second would be to maybe evaluate if it really needs to be done right away, and just go to lunch (This if course carries the risk of getting fired).
I got a lot more exercise when I was a PC support person, due to the simple fact that I had to get up and physically visit the PC in distress.  When I transitioned to unix support I found that I didn't have to go visit machines as much; now with decent LOMs and the like I frequently don't have to touch machines unless there's something physically broken.
Telecom Engineer - Specifically, physical network wiring design and implementation.  Although to be fair, this is stuff that IT contract out because it is dirty, miserable, and physical work.  Working for a small business I have the lovely task of running my own drops where needed.  Believe me I wish I had the resources to hire that crap out.  I wouldn't call if glamorous, but you'll be on your feet.
I'm actually working for a consulting firm, so I usually spend some time each day going from one place to another, which forces me to stand up and move around some.
