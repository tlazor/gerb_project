Check the 'System cooling policy', the next item in the power window. It should be set to active (when plugged in), so that increases in processor temperature increase the fan speed, rather than decreasing the processor freqency (passive).
There is a tool notebook hardware control, it allows changing the speed stepping options on the fly. In your case the option would be full performance.
To disable it under windows, select the Power Options and select High Performance.  Make sure that the minimum and maximum processor states are 100% and the System Cooling Policy to be Active.
Since none of the answers take on what speed step does exactly and how to disable/enable it here is what I found:
I did some searching for a third-party vendor-neutral taskbar utility (like Lenovo's Energy Management utility) and found Power Switch. I tested it quickly with CPUz; in power mode the CPU maxed out and stayed in that state, in balanced while playing a video it would jump all over the place and in power saver mode it just stayed at 800h MHz. Tested on a laptop with an Intel i7-4720 CPU.
It sounds like SpeedStep can be found in either the BIOS or the OS and maybe even both.  My guess is that DELL maybe lying to you about the performance, I say try disabling it and see what happens.
