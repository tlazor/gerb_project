It is risky to trust a third-party application to store your important passwords especially those applications that are potentially able to connect online or those you authorize them to access the processes of other program; and more importantly to trust non-open source ones.
I recommend KeePassXC which is a community fork of KeePassX, a native cross-platform port of KeePass Password Safe, with the goal to extend and improve it with new features and bugfixes to provide a feature-rich, fully cross-platform and modern open-source password manager.
Also if you are a programmer, I suggest you to build a simple one for yourself that uses encoding to secure data. Thats the best solution.
I use Notepad and .txt files. If you want my advice, I advice you not to use a third party sodtware. From where do you know they are not stealing your passwords?
A more secure way, in my opinion, is to store your important passwords in a text file (.TXT) and then encrypt the file with AES algorithm by dsCrypt.exe. You are required to enter your main password into dsCrypt only once and you will be able to encrypt/decrypt you password text file many times without asking you re-enter the main password every time as long as dsCrypt is running. You can auto-run dsCrypt with your Windows start and enter your main password once; and what you need then is just to drag and drop your password file (.txt) onto dsCrypt to de/encrypt it when you need your passwords.
