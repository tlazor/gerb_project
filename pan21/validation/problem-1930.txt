The truth is that a lot of us crusty neckbeard type linux admins 'magically' configure machines because we've completely internalized the knowledge over many years of repetition.  I know approximately the list of config files I need to touch on any given machine, and I can hand-edit those from memory.  That's actually a terrible way to do things, particularly if you have more than one server or more than one sysadmin.  Hand-editing a config file is always a mark of bad planning and bad management.
I'm a big fan of using Clonezilla plus PXE boot to automatically bring up a system initially, and put enough details into a Kickstart config so that the machine is on the network and running the CM tool of your choice.  Everything beyond the most basic 'bring the system up, put it on the network' logic should go in your CM tool, not in your initial system image or Kickstart.
The answer to this is definitely formal configuration management.  The three big contenders in that space these days are Chef, Puppet, and Cfengine.  Basically you need to apply the development approach to system administration: Write up a 'program' that defines the machine state, and apply that (obviously that's a gross simplification).
