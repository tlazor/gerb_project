Also if you want to insist on using neural network for seasonal data, you may want to check recurrent neural networks out as they could incorporate the past observations better than a vanilla neural network, and supposedly may provide a better result for the data that you have. 
In your notebooks, I did not see your neural network model, can you point which library is using, how many layers you have and what type of neural network are you using?
In fact, I would suggest (if you haven't done so already) trying a simple model with few or no parameters first e.g. Linear Regression, and compare your results with the literature, just as a sanity check. 
As a side note, it seems that increasing the number of neurons in your model show no significant improvement for your RMSE. This suggests that you could also try with a simpler model, i.e. with less neurons and see how your model behaves.
I wrote couple of things on outlier detection in time-series signals, your data is highly seasonal as sobach mentioned and you could use FFT(first link above) to get the overall trend in the signal. After you get the frequency component in the gas consumption, you could look at the high frequency components to get the outliers. 
In your training notebook you present results for training with 20 epochs. Have you tried varying that parameter, to see if it affects your performance? This is an important parameter for back-propagation. 
In your notebooks, it seems you are using the noisy and outlier dataset to train the neural network, I think you should train the neural network on the dataset that you do not have any outliers so that you could see the observation distance from the prediction of the neural network to label the observation either outlier or not. 
For estimating your model parameters, as user tomaskazemekas pointed out, plotting Learning Curves is a very good approach. In addition to that, you could also create a plot using a model parameter (e.g. training epochs or hidden layer size) vs. Training and Validation error. This will allow you to understand the bias/variance tradeoff, and help you pick a good value for your parameters. Some info can be found here. Naturally, it is a good idea to keep a small percentage of your data for a (third) Test set.
