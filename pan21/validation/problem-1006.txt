We have a dedicated server, a very powerful one, and I don't believe we are getting the most out of MySQL. Even when running ultra-heavy processes that take a very long time to complete, I'm showing minimal CPU & memory usage, as if we have a gattling gun at our disposal, and we're using it to shoot BB's.
It's a very hard thing, it depends on maany maaany other things including database structures. If you want to follow optimal settings and have some improvement with one our post, then only thing I can suggest is to use some tools like this:
Additionally, I was wondering if there was any way we could control which user accounts would have access to higher performance-levels. Most of the accounts on our server are clients of ours. We have one account specifically that would like to have a giant share of the overall DB usage. Is this possible?
I would like to create a setup where MySQL is taking FULL ADVANTAGE of the powerful setup we have going. What kind of settings do I need to add to my.cnf in order to make this happen?
