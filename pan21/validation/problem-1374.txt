The switches allow the different devices in the network to communicate, this include the communication between the devices and the DHCP server.

Either all devices have a statically configured IP address, or you use a DHCP server that will assign the IP automatically. (or a mix of it, generally servers and specific devices like printers have static IP addresses while users computer have DHCP assigned IP)
How does switch issues IP address for each of the machine plug-in? since switch does not act like router and do not provide DHCP service.
Many routers include a DHCP server feature, but you don't have to use them. A server, be it Windows, Linux, Netware, Solaris, etc.. can act as the DHCP server.
Some high-end (read expensive) switches have routing capabilities and even DHCP services but this is really different functions embedded in a single box, and the DHCP service is still unrelated to the switching function.
I am not that much detailed but even though it is small today you have to think your small network should be able to grow scale, that needs good documentation.
I intend to setup a small office network. Based on the article below, it mention that I should use switch for all the LAN points for my cubicles, but I am puzzled.
