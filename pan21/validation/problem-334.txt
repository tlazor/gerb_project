I second a lot of things David said in his post about Networking - this is the only way you will find reliable artists to work on your game for little to no money. But I will add some tips as well:
It is simply impossible to know with 100% certainty how well someone will work out until you work with them on something, so the way around this Catch-22 is find people to do small projects and only do big projects with people you've already done small projects with. Doing a small project it's okay if things go south and you have to lick your wounds to start over with someone else.
If however you want to recruit an artist from the beginning then don't expect to direct everything. They will want and rightly expect a lot of creative control; after all, the project is as much a speculative venture for them as it is for you.
The answer depends on exactly your intention. The more control you want to have, the more you have to be bringing to the table. For example, you could build the game using placeholder art and then try to find a talented artist to polish all the graphics. Similarly, if you pay them (up-front cash, not a percentage of future profits) then by definition you are bringing money to the table.
I ask "how" rather than "where" because there are undoubtedly lots of artists that are just plain lousy or unreliable.
Artists are generally as lousy and unreliable as the client is, so the answer is to be professional and to look for professionals.
