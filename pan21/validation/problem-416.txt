The answer, as always, is "it depends."  If you have a small number of routers that don't change very often then document everything, use Visio or whatever.
A few years since I had to do this and there must be better solutions available by now: I used a custom expect script to fetch and backup the live switch and router configurations and diff'd for changes.
On the other hand, if you have a large number of routers with regularly changing configurations (a typical service provider) then you should create high level network diagrams with key interfaces shown clearly.  A configuration management tool like rancid is absolutely essential in a busy service provider environment and is easy to set up so a worthwhile investment of time anywhere IMO.
I don't know about Visio, but Dia supports layers, if you can use layers with Visio then that might help manage the diagram from becoming overwhelming.  For instance, you could make a layer for all the 'connections', another layer for the interfaces, etc.  And then show and hide the layers to see the information you are interested in.
Couple of different ways. Mainly I do NOT rely on static documentation for current info. It's never "current" due to the nature of a network. Let it be as self-documenting as possible.
