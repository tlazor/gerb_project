But isn't what you are after for providing a simple PS script for the Helpdesk to use.  You might consider opening a ticket with O365 support, but my experience with that has been hit or miss.  Sometimes it seems I get someone that knows only scripted answers, and then there are times where it seems I get the actual developers themselves.
There are a few sites out there that have all cut and pasted the same snippet of code to iterate all the users in a sharepoint mysites collection and remove all of them, but I'm not convinced that code works for sharepoint 2013 sites and it's trivial to remove a user's permissions from a site. But I don't want to do either of those things, I just want to remove one user's profile from mysites.
Running commands such as repair-sposite or remove-sposite work for the entire site collection, e.g. repair-sposite -identity https://example-my.sharepoint.com works on the whole site collection, so the last thing I want to be doing is running remove-sposite at this level, and running it at a deeper level (repair-sposite -identity https://example-my.sharepoint.com/personal/user_example_com) fails to locate a sharepoint site to work with.
I've been generating a library to use for sharepoint online, so I've been writing hundreds of these small tasks lately, but basically you'll need to use CSOM commands.
I'm trying to work out a process that would allow my helpdesk to delete an individual user's profile from Office 365 sharepoint online using powershell.
