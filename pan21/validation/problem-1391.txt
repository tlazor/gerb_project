I've made your question my task for tonight and I managed to get a working version. Be careful it is rather hacky! As far as I know there's no other way to do that. Especially because there's a bug in awesome with applying rules.  
PS: This won't work for applications like Steam because it pops up multiple windows. The first one gets the correct tag. The following are spawning on tag "1".
You have to replace Termite with the console emulator which you usually start with Mod4 + return. In addition to that you need to add each program to the class table you want to start with key bindings.  
What we are doing? When executing Mod4 + r we save the current focused tag to a list. When applying rules to appearing windows we pop the corresponding tag from the list. We need the once function because awesome has a bug at the moment and applies rules twice to a window. We have to exclude our terminal emulator (and all other programs we start with key binding) from that because otherwise it's being opened on the tag where we last pressed Mod4 + r.
