You need to look at the timing of different network packets back and forth between your computer, DNS server, and web host(s). If using a proxy server you need to check that traffic.
Compare the time between DNS lookup, response, web server (HTTP) request, and web server response. A typical web page will have many individual parts, each of which is a request from your computer and response by the server. Check the same page from another computer/network to see differences. Remember to clear your DNS and browser caches before testing. 
Before digging into networks and packet sniffing and all that, make sure it is not browser specific, install a fresh copy of Chrome and see how it does. Then make sure it's not machine specific, try it on other machines on the same network. Then make sure it's not network specific, try it from a wi-fi cafe, or a friend's house. 
If it's still slow, Prof Moriarty and Willam have some great places to dig deeper. Is it a large page with a long TABLE? Plug-in's? IFRAMES? Lots of javascript?
