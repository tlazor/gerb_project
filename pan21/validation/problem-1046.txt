You might revise step 1. You are limiting your customer base. You could limit the set of distributions supported, but I wouldn't go for just one.
If you need to spawn many nodes at a time bittorent is tempting but beware, you could bring some switches/routers to their knees if you don't pay attention.
For application distribution I would provide packages in a format native to the OS of the nodes. Application update would be a simple package update then, which is as easy on sysadmin as it can be.
Is that common practice? Is there a better strategy? Are there any additional angles I should think about?
Or you might prepare an automated-install system/image (using the distributions native non-interactive installation system, or combine it with e.g. xCat), which would deploy a complete OS, configure it, and then load your application on top.
If you want to prepare a whole environment, from the OS level up, you have 2 options. You might prepare a VM file in a chosen format (or formats). Then you would have to prepare the whole environment, from the OS up.
You could try tools like SystemImager which supports PXE Multicast distribution and even bittorent protocol to disitrbute changes.
It sounds like you are a prime candidate for a cloud-based computing solution. I would investigate using something like Amazon's EC2, which automates all of the steps you listed down to the click of a button. And don't restrict yourself to just EC2, there are plenty of competitors out there.
