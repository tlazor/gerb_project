Would be better since the router is not filtering in bridge mode, it should not offer the option of configuring guest networks. Only offer it when being configured as a router.
If ASUS implemented it flawlessly then it's safe to do, but nothing in computer security is actually flawless.
As far as it's concerned, a "Guest" network is just a common feature among many routers or ISRs that will just create another subnet and aditionally a separate WLAN with it's corresponding ESSID restricting the broadcast domain and it won't route any traffic to the main network from it; this means you couldn't ssh 192.168.1.1 for example, from any host at, say, 192.168.0.0 (the "Guest" network). But it's worth noting that given the right conditions it won't prevent computers in the "Guest" network to access the main network or a DMZ through the WAN (i.e. using the NAT public address), or even from the internet if the firewall is open, among other things.
In simple words, it just isolates the main network from the guest network on the LAN port, so you could say it's safe and serves its purpose as it should.
Ron was correct that this is an opinion-based question depending on how risk averse you are, but here are some factors to consider:
My ASUS RT-AC68U router has an option to enable a "guest network". I'm curious how "safe" this is. The config page claims that it only allows traffic through to the internet, so I assume it physically blocks traffic from the Guest network to any LAN port and only allows it to flow through the WAN port?
