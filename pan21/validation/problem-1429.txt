What I like most about ITIL, is that it defines a common language to use when talking to IT pros from other companies, even more so in the European multi-lingual multi-cultural environment. ...  
I really should add at this point that we've implemented incident vs. problem management for our helpdesk and it has been very helpful.
Anyone who implements ITIL dogmatically is a fool (and they told me that on an "official" ITIL course).
You can/are supposed to adapt and adopt parts of it to your needs. It's obviously nuts for a one IT person shop to try and implement ITIL, when most of the conversations between the various "areas" of change management, release management, etc are actually going to take place inside one person's brain but having said that, at the other end of the scale, if you just got offered a fortune to be internal helpdesk manager for Microsoft or HP or Apple or whoever, with users and helpdesk callcentres all over the place, how could you possibly do the job at all without ITIL or something similar as a guideline?
