You could also check for updates on Zone Alarm.  I believe there was a recent ZoneAlarm update and I saw a favorable review.
I am facing a strange issue of losing internet connectivity sometime after logging in. The only workaround seems to be restarting the system. Other systems on the wireless network sharing the internet connection works well.
There is a known issue with using both AVG and Zone Alarm firewall.  This may have been resolved by now with updates.  The problem was with using the AVG link scanner component along with Zone Alarm firewall.  Unfortunately, disabling link scanner isn't enough and link scanner can't be separately uninstalled.  The solution that worked for me was to uninstall AVG and then do a custom install but don't install the link scanner component.  It wouldn't take long to give this a try.  
Any chance that it's happening after being idle a bit?  Windows 7 has different options to turn off components - in my case, it was turning off the network after 20 minutes.  I disabled all the power saving settings, except for the screen saver/monitor off, and my network is no longer dying.
You might research what applications you have running. (it took me a while to realize utorrent was causing me network and connectivity issues) you can also right click on the connection icon in the lower right corner and then left click 'Troubleshoot problems', maybe Windows knows whats wrong.
