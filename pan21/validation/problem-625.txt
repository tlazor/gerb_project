It is not obvious how those two could possibly be connected. But it is possible to formulate a hypothesis which can then be tested.
It may be that upon receiving neighbor discovery requests, the gateway responds with the MAC address of the other interface. This is at least a plausible behavior considering that both interfaces are configured with the same /64. But as packets are send to that other MAC address, the network interface will drop them until the network interface is switched into promiscuous mode.
In a correct configuration you use the link prefix you got from your provider on the WAN interface, and you use the routed prefix you got from your provider on the LAN interface. If the routed prefix is shorter than a /64 (which it is supposed to be), then you can pick any /64 out of that /48 for your LAN. For example if your provider gave you routed prefix 2001:db8:1234::/48, your LAN prefix could be 2001:db8:1234::/64, 2001:db8:1234:ffff::/64, 2001:db8:1234:babe::/48, or any of the 65533 other possibilities.
What happens when you run tcpdump is that it (by default) turns the network interface into promiscuous mode, which means the hardware will start accepting Ethernet frames even if they were not send to the MAC address of that network interface.
There is one obvious mistake in the configuration of your gateway. Both interfaces have been configured with the same /64.
