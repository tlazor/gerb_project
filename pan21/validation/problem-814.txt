Use a junction. You can use the Link Shell Extension ( http://schinagl.priv.at ). Best of all, programs won't notice.
5) voil√† - now you have a list of alphabetized shortcuts that includes everything you wanted, with the dummy folder at the bottom
In Windows Vista and 7 you can use NTFS symbolic link. Wikipedia states that "the NTFS symbolic link implementation provides full support for cross-filesystem links."
I was able to do something similar to what you're asking for in Windows XP, but pointing to network locations rather than an external drive, but you may still be able to get it to work.  Basically if you go to My Network Places and click the "Add a network place" option and type the path into the wizard it will generate a shortcut that is treated like a folder.  I've used this in my workplace when for various reasons I can't assign a drive letter to a network location that my users need to access frequently.  I'm sure you've solved your problem by now but hopefully this helps someone else at some point.
1) make a dummy folder within the parent folder, named "zzz-real folders", to alphabetize at the bottom.
0) Let's say you've got 10 real folders and 10 shortcuts to folders elsewhere and all 20 are in a parent folder, and you're frustrated because the shortcuts alphabetize at the bottom instead of alphabetizing by name with the real folders.
If you're not comfortable using the command line program mklink, you can use Link Shell Extension. After downloading and installing the software, follow the step-by-step guide in "Using Link Shell Extension". Basically you select the folder on the external/remote drive, click "pick link source", go back to the original drive and choose "drop as Symbolic Link".
