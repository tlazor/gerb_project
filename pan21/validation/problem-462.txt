Open a simple text editor, like Notepad, and type in the commands with the arguments you want it to take, like so:
(In this example, putty.exe is a program that can take IP addresses as arguments, and it's saved in C:\Users\\useful-files\executables.) When you're done, save it with the .bat extension (if you're using Notepad, just make sure you replace the .txt it starts you off with; in our example, we could save it as something like run-putty-with-IP.bat).
It sounds like you want a brief script that you can just double-click to run a command with certain arguments - is that right? If it is, here's one way:
If you open any folder, then the shortest way to run any application with arguments is just typing program name and arguments in the upper textbox.
Note that certain programs, without configuring system or environment variables, will require you to change to their directory to be able to execute them, hence the cd command included here.
If you've done this correctly, in File Explorer it will show the file type as "Windows Batch File" and double-clicking it will run its contents.
Is there an easy way to launch an application from Windows Explorer with arguments?  Or do I have to actually run them from the command line?
