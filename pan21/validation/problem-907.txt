If you're installing the operating systems on separate drives, however, you should install windows first because windows may disable other bootloaders during its installation. Once you're done installing windows, install Ubuntu on a separate partition/drive. Ubuntu should detect windows and add it to the boot menu for dual booting automatically. This works for me and should for you.
Lastly, why do you have to unplug one of your drives to boot from the other? I'm guessing you disconnected the drive containing windows during the ubuntu install so it might not have detected and added windows to the boot menu. Or it may just be ubuntu's fault. Either way, I would suggest reinstalling ubuntu so you have a properly configured dual boot system and not one where you have to edit bios settings to switch operating systems.
Going into the BIOS and changing your boot sequence every time you want to switch between operating systems is not the best solution. One option would be to install Ubuntu within windows using wubi.
