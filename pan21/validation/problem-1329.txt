Well, the way you wrote your script, it does everything sequentially - one line after another. However, there are ways to execute commands parallely using python on a Raspberry Pi, whether it's a zero, a 3b or something else.
The keywords you are looking for are threads and sub-processes (both links are for Python2.7, but you'll find the Python3 documentation on the same webpage). Both are fairly similar in implementation and results for most purposes.
I'm trying to setup a concurrent photo capture and immediate email of said capture (triggered by a PIR motion sensor) in a Python script.  Basically what I'm trying to accomplish is to have my Pi take a picture with the attached 8MP picamera and have it send the picture via email.  I have successfully created a script that can accomplish both these tasks, but no photos are captured while the PIR sensor is triggered until the task of sending out the email with the first capture is completed.  Is it possible to do both of these tasks concurrently on the Pi Zero? I have attached the relevant code below.  
You don't need a subprocess here. Just send Emails, regardless of the computer your code is running on, in a different thread:
