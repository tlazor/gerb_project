Unfortunately, with this method, you have to explicitly trigger it for the video, and cannot have it default to this for all torrents/files.
This used to be an advanced option in uTorrent you could set for all torrents, but now the only way to do it is if you click on the torrent, go to the files tab below the torrent list, rick click the video, Copy Stream URL, open that up with a video player such as VLC and then it will set that file to download sequentially. After that, you can either leave the video running closing the player should keep it downloading sequentially afterward.
See uTorrent settings with opened parameters bt.sequential_download (use this for sequential download one movie) and bt.sequential_files (use this for sequential download TVseries from in that sequence as specified in torrent file).
As far as I know there is no way to control what files of a torrent are downloaded first due to the very nature of a Torrent. If it were possible to do so then I would imagine Torrents would lose their viability for a method of downloading files quickly (again, due to the nature in which torrents are executed).
I recall looking something similar to this up a long time ago and was unable to find anything useful. Did a bit of looking around again and got just about the same responses :/
One way would be to mark all Files as "Do Not Download" and then manually mark the files as "Highest Priority" one by one. Of course, the speed will be affected because of this and there's the manual part.
