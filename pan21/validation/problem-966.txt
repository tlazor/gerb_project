Each client application will specify a different entity id (EntityDescriptor/@entityID) per each installation.  It is conventional to have the entity ID be the same as the root of the application installation.  So if you access dev at http://server/dev/Default.aspx and prod at http://server/prod/Default.aspx, then your entities might be http://server/dev/ and  http://server/prod/ respectively.
In terms of the actual configuration, you don't need a FederationMetadata.xml file if you enter the parameters manually.  Otherwise, you can generate the file on demand using System.IdentityModel.Metadata (for .Net 4) or Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSFederation.Metadata (for <= .Net 3.5 on WIF).
You should have one STS per identity database (1 ADFS per Active Directory forest) and one RP per application deployment (FederationMetadata.xml document loaded as a relying party in ADFS).
Production and Dev, for example, can be two RPs on the same ADFS server.  The Federation Metadata should change with the installation.
