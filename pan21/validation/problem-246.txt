So based on the information I've given what do you think could be my problem? Or is my HDD just toast?   
Oh and to confuse things further, I have another partition on the HDD running Backtrack 5. Which still boots up and operates as smoothly as tropicana.
Now the OS boots up very quickly at this point. But after startup, the machine takes ages to do anything that might require accessing the HDD, e.g. browsing files, opening programs etc. Even right-clicking a folder to get to properties took about 10-seconds to get a response.
Try running chkdsk /r from an Administrator command prompt (it'll tell you it needs to schedule it for the next reboot - let it do so and then reboot). This will try and fix any bad sectors and repair filesystem damage. It'll also give you a good idea just how far along the drive failure has progressed. If it's repairing tons of bad sectors, I'd replace the drive pre-emptively. I'm guessing based on the performance you're seeing it'll be pretty bad.
If chkdsk doesn't find much or only finds a couple of bad sectors (which can be fairly normal), then I'd proceed with trying a re-install of Windows. That's honestly your best bet - repairing a corrupted registry rarely works in my experience.
There is no permanent fix for this. There is a possible workaround where sectors get remapped to spare sectors (which should trigger automatically). However if the drive has failed sectors then it is likely dying and you want to backup your data as fast as possible.
If you insert a spare drive in the laptop and it is equally slow/problematic then you know the problem is in the laptop (motherboard, connectors, whatever).
I took this opportunity to slowly but surely back-up my precious data, and am now prepared for the worst. I also ran cCleaner on the registry. The OS still starts up, but with no change to the performance. 
I then ran a HDD diagnostic, which performed a funnel seek test (which it failed), a linear seek test (which it failed) and a random seek test (which it passed).
Test the drive speed on another computer. E.g. take the drive out, put it in an desktop (as second drive) or in an external USB or eSATA case and read all. If it is fast and error free then the problem is not the drive.
The strange thing is, I had exactly this same terrifying issue about 3 months ago, but for some reason, the machine just fought through and began working again as normal. 
Definitely sounds like a dying hard drive. It's very possible that the Backtrack partition will run fine (because there's nothing wrong on that part of the disk...yet) and yet the Windows partition behaves as you've described.
I woke up the other day to find that my Sony Vaio VPC wouldn't boot up after multiple attempts. After running a system diagnostic check using the built-in recovery partition that came with the laptop, I was informed by the report that my registry is corrupted. However with no further effort, Windows 7 booted up on the next attempt.
