I'm wondering how to architect a database when there are multiple paths (via foreign keys) to a common parent table.
You are thinking about this incorrectly. An assignment submission from a student not enrolled in the corresponding course, if it happens to get marked, is not fundamentally different from a properly submitted and marked submission from a student who subsequently drops the course. Allow the entry of the mark to exist in the database, by noting that when the final report of assignment marks for each course is generated, the (inner) join will fail for all submissions for students not enrolled in the course at exam time. That is sufficient to properly implement the business logic.
Is there a way to handle this in the database design or would it just have to be done via the business logic?
Now I'm going to create a new table that store Assignments submissions from each student. What's the best way to structure it such that a student from another class can't get added to an assignment from this class?
