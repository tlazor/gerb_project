If the prior, you could use something such as VNC/LogMeIn to connect to the console -- and the system wouldn't know you were remotely connected.
Are you looking to run a single piece of management software, or provide an application to a terminal server? 
I'm kind of confused but I'll take a crack at this. In terms of remoting into a server using RDP you can use the console connection so that you can run apps that need that console state. Click on Start-->Run and type in 'mstsc.exe /?' (without single quotes). This will bring up the help switches for whatever version of RDP you're currently running. You can use these switches to launch RDP using the console session. For instance for the version I'm currently running (Windows 7 RC) I would type 'mstsc.exe /v:exampleserver /admin' to connect to the console session for the server named exampleserver. Be aware that there are differences out there in RDP versions because that /admin switch used to be /console. If you want to be sure then connect to your target server and run that /? command and see what it expects for the console connection.
The danger in the later is that some applications use shared resources (an application we use has the same named temp files, so multiple users cause corruption) and simply cannot run on a terminal server under multiple instances due to poor design.
