I've also checked out a number of other game design books that didn't do much for me, such as "Fundamentals of Game Design."  Many repeat the same few truisms and have a very low signal/noise ratio.
Having said that I'd consider suggesting screenplay writing material as it shows you what connects with people and what doesn't. I'm not talking about linear progress material here like stories, but what kind of characters connect with people, themes, motifs etc. 
You basically just want to write down everything and anything that comes to mind about the design of the game as you play. Having a journal like this will be invaluable to you when you design your own games. 
If you're really interested in technical aspects of screenwriting you can also take a look at Screenwriter's Bible - but that one is more oriented towards technical aspects of screenplay formats and structures.
All of the best books have already been posted, but there’s one book that I feel is invaluable to a game designer. Your own journal. When you play games, keep a journal nearby and jot down notes. What about the game design did you like? Didn’t like? Did anything really stand out and if so why? Did you disagree with a particular design choice? 
I was very fond of Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design. It goes into depths of interactive game mechanics as related to player, which is the only unique element to game development as editing is to movies. 
I can't believe nobody mentioned Game Programming Gems yet. I always considered it to be the standard when it comes to game design.
Game design and development are different (often confused) topics.  Game design concerns the design of gameplay and game mechanics (rules of the game, so to speak) rather than the actual coding, audio and graphic design involved in implementing the game.  I believe this question is about Game design.
