If you're looking at a router, try to find SNMP data for it, then you can graph it with munin, mrtg, or a whole bunch of other SNMP handling devices.
If you had a cisco router capable of supporting NetFlow data, you could use this and a NetFlow listener  to look at the traffic data.
If you're looking at a linux box, install something like iptraf (command line, ncurses traffic monitor), or munin (graphing util).
If all you want with your monitoring is to see which programs access the Internet then a normal software firewall should do the trick as well.
If you actually want to look at the traffic, the a program like WireShark might be what you are looking for.
The idea is that you could boot your actual system (i.e. your Windows XP installed on your C:) in virtual machine using VirtualBox.
If by look at you mean to measure the bandwidth then maybe a program like BitMeter II or BitMeter OS is what you are looking for.
You should create new virtual machine and set your real partition (C:) to be used as HDD in this virtual machine.
