I can copy stuff (files and clipboard contents) from other VMs and the host into the linux guest, even using drag & drop, but the other way fails. I can copy text and images from the clip board if I press Shift+Ctrl to release mouse and keyboard from the guest. But copying files or drag & drop doesn't work at all. Moreover, when I try to leave the guest window with the mouse, the mouse appears to "stick" at the edge of the guest (the mouse pointer is "flung" back into the guest window a couple of times until I can proceed, the exact behavior varies).
I am running linux (Gentoo 3.15.5-hardened-r2) as a guest under VMware workstation 9.0.2, the host is Windows 7 Enterprise. My desktop environment in the linux guest ist KDE 4.12.5. I use the open-vm-tools 2013.09.16.1328054-r3 (VMware tools are simply too much trouble and pain to build).
This all used to work once without any trouble (older version of VMware workstation, VMware tools, linux kernel, KDE, Qt, etc.).
I run RoyalTS for my RDP connections. When RoyalTS is running, i cannot copy+paste between host and guest. If i close RoyalTS it starts working. Starting RoyalTS again breaks copy+paste.
VMware guest isolation settings are enabled for drag & drop and for copy & paste. Rebooting and restarting everything does not improve anything.  vmtoolsd is running.
