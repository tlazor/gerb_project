Or there's the ever present screencap/activity monitor installed on the server itself, which neatly bypasses any encryption by just taking video and keystroke data.
I'm sure they can see the activity on their network, but if I check (for example) my personal gmail from work, and it's over https it should be invisible right? As far as I know the network is monitored, but I don't believe the local computer is actually monitored/key logged.
If they control the machine, the could have installed a CA certificate allowing them to forge certs and perform a MITM attack.  There are monitoring products that do this.
Realistically if you're on a "compromised" terminal - whether that be by corporate policy or a hacker, SSL will not protect your data.
If I am on a network that is monitored, like the network at my office is, but I am on websites that use https, or if I SSH into a server, can that traffic be monitored or does it just show as encrypted noise?
Network security is not exactly my area of expertese so I apologize if I've phrased this question wrong or if it's already been asked somewhere:
