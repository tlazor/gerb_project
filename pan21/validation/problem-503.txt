So you get the best backup, first stop any service or process that is writing files.  Ideally you would stop everything except your SSH connection.
Any recommendations on how to create a full-disk backup for a remote machine? I have SSH root access.
A physical to virtual conversion isn't quite what you asked for, but is a pretty effective backup - VMWare Converter Standalone will do this (you need to specify the source as RHEL).  You could then trim down the spec and run it in VMware player or on an ESX server.
Another method I tend to prefer for this is to just copy the filesystem with rsync.  Assuming you have another linux box to backup to this command would get everything on the root filesystem.  If you have additional filesystems you need to copy those separately.  
Everything seems to have been migrated properly, but just incase some things didn't get transferred properly, I'd like to make a complete filesystem backup of the older server just incase. (Something I can navigate easily, like a .tar.gz. I'm estimating that compressed it will be about 10GB.)
