The problem is you probably want the language to be without extra symbols like equality, addition, multiplication (right?), if we had them then by MRDP theorem, Diophantine formulas (first-order existential quantifiers in front of an equality of two polynomials) would capture c.e. sets. If we are not allowing these symbols in the language, the problem is more complicated, one can use higher order quantifiers to define them, but that would increase the quantifier complexity. So if I want to give a short answer to your question about a single quantifier, I don't know.
Assume that we have a restriction of VO which can express at least $AC^0$. Then a single unbounded existential quantifier of number type in front of those restricted formulas will give the whole c.e. sets.
If we can express $AC^0$  relations in the language, then a single unbounded existential quantifier would suffice for capturing c.e. sets, the reason is $AC^0$ can check that a string $c$ is the computation of a TM $e$ on input $x$. First-order formulas bounded by polynomials in presence of equality, addition, and multiplication capture PH, so if we have them in the language the answer is positive, but as I said you are probably looking for a language without these symbols.
Note that in VO, one is defining sets over the set of natural numbers (similar to sets defined in recursion theory) where as in descriptive complexity setting (SO, $\exists$-SO, SO-Horn) we are talking about finite structures. An SO formula in the former setting will give not $PH$ but the whole analytical hierarchy as Arthur Milchior has written in his answer. IMHO, a better comparison would be with bounded arithmetic theories. I don't think you can get below c.e. sets unless you bound all quantifiers to finite domains, to get $P$ or $NP$ the size of domains should be very small.
