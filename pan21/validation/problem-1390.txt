When I try and delete it through powershell I get 'Get-ChildItem : The path is not of a legal form' 
If I open the '.' folder, it's as if I did 'ls -l ./'.  If I go one deeper I get an error 'This file path refers to a location that is unavailable.'  
EDIT: but it is very sad, that there is no Windows integrated way to delete this folder... or at least no easy way... maybe someone else has an good idea.
I'm using UrbanCode Deploy for windows code deployments, and in my folder I've created a folder '.' .  I've tried all the powershell remove-item commands and flags I can think of, I've tried robocopy move / purge copying it somewhere else, and run a chkdsk with no reported errors. 
At least a colleague tried it with a third party tool named "Long path remover" (from "Thorsten Eggeling"). This tool could also remove folders with not compliant names. But i don't find it on the internet anymore... Maybe you can or you try it with an similar tool that may help you. Maybe an other remover tool could delete it too.
i had an similar problem some months before. I also tried everything with Powershell / CMD and other Windows standard featueres. Nothing helped.
