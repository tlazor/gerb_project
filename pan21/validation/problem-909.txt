To do what I needed, I had to open the "Group Properties" within the "Grouping Window" (not within the report's "Design" window by right clicking on the Table) for the "SUBGROUP LEVEL". I then enabled/checked all 3 boxes in the "Page Break" configuration section (i.e. "B/w each instance of a group", "Also at the start of a group", "Also at the end of a group"). This produce my desire results of a page break before and after this grouping of data. 
My report had 1 Parent grouping with a Sub-Group at the end of the Parent structure. So it looked something like this:
Please note that I did not add the page breaks to the "MAIN GROUP LEVEL" b/c it would have produced duplicate breaking for how my report was structured. Since the SUBGROUP data was at the end of my report, I did not have to enable a page break at the MAIN level. If the "MAIN GROUP LEVEL" continued after the "SUBGROUP", I probably would have had to configure a Page Break for this as well.
(Since I cannot answer my own question, I'm adding my answer to my question. Thanks again James, I wouldn't have been able to do this without your guidance.)
