What you are trying to do is encode data within the FM band. This is called Radio Data System (or widely known as RDS).
"Above audible frequency" will be > 20,000Hz.  Anything common and user-accessible designed to transmit/receive audio in physical, analog, hearable form will cut off at 20,000Hz and probably lower.  Of course digital mediums and protocols work at much higher frequencies, but none of those are directly connected to a speaker or an audio output, they are transceived to "physical" or analog 20-20KHz audio on both ends to drive a speaker, etc.  So I don't think what you want to do is possible, though again I am not sure.
You will need to look for a RDS encoder - you can get hardware and software ones - the software one will require additional hardware (from a quick search)...
And of course, the higher frequency you go, even if audible, the higher the chance it will be attenuated - if the actual sound medium is an unknown to you.  Probably the best "cover-all-cases" frequency range would be those supported by analog POTS, which is only 300 to 3400Hz range.  International shortwave's limit is 5000Hz.  FM radio's range is up to 15KHz.
If you accept defeat/compromise at this point and want to transmit data over human-hearable audio technology, you have DMTF and of course the plethora of modem standards.  A Linux program I've never tried that can decode DMTF and others is multimon.  Then there was this project which was a Linux modem implemented in software, that would take incoming streaming audio and decode various modem standards, and obviously encode them too, but I don't think this was updated since 2000.
There is technology called Radio Data System in place for that and the standard is already defined. From wikipedia:
