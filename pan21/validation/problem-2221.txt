Second, there's a common belief among game developers that making a game easy in some way "cheapens" the experience: that rewards won't be appreciated by players who didn't put in the work. But people differ: not everyone appreciates games in this way. The players who most appreciate overcoming difficulties are exactly the players who will seek out difficulties even if the game makes them optional.
There are a couple of reasons why this happens, both forms of the typical mind fallacy (the belief that everyone else is pretty much the same as you).
I can only guess that the Rock Band developers did not initially consider the possibility that families would enjoy the experience of playing the game together even if not all family members have the hand-eye coordination to hit a drum in time. They had to see people trying it (and the consequent frustration when most of the game proved to be out of reach) before they were motivated to make it easy enough.
Yes, game developers should make their games easier. Moreover, they should not wait for new versions to do so: they should try to make the first version easier. Nearly all games are too hard for many players.
First, game developers typically work in a cycle where they write code (or design levels) and then test their work by playing it. This means that their sense of how the game plays is biased towards their own experience of it. As a game progresses, the developers get better and better at playing it, and lose all insight into how the game plays for a beginner.
Harmonix is an example of a game developer taking a long time to get the difficulty level right. Their first game, Frequency, was very hard, and each successive rhythm-action game has been slightly easier. For example, the first Rock Band game is easy enough for most adult beginners to play a few of the easier songs, but still too hard for some beginners and for young children. Why did Harmonix not make it possible for beginners to play all of the songs? Why did they not make it easy enough for young children (who love the game) to join in? Finally Rock Band 3 got it right with a "no failure" setting.
The only way to correct for this bias is to bring in fresh testers—people who have never played the game before—and observe them (so-called kleenex testing). But even with this kind of testing you risk testing only on people who, while they may not have played your game before, are skilled game players in general.
