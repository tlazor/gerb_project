There are a variety of terminal servers on the market -- you telnet/ssh to them and upon connection, you can interact with one or more serial ports on the console server, which are typically hooked via a null-modem cable to other servers. If the server has a serial port, this is the best way to go. You can then use a mobile broadband device to get a connection, and add some dynamic DNS or VPN magic to deal with changes of the IP.
Older GPRS/EDGE USB modules (or handsets with USB) would present as a serial device (ttyUSB or ttyACM) in Linux; it should be possible to switch the server's inittab to bind the getty to that. I've done this in the past with an external (actual-serial-port connected) GSM modem; I'd imagine it should work with USB as well.
If the server has an internal modem, not a serial port, and you can't replace it, things get more complicated. VoIP might work -- the closer to raw PCM, the better the odds are. Fixed wireless terminals (basically a cell phone but with an FXS port instead of a speaker/mic/keypad) might work as well, but are likely to have the same issues as VoIP.
