It might do for secondary storage, so long as you're not doing a great deal of editing on it, but I would keep a backup.
SD cards lack any of the intelligence that an SSD controller has and are effectively just a dumb block of flash memory.
SD cards do not have wear levelling and many filesystems will repeatedly rewrite the same blocks with minor changes every time a file changes. Unless you make the filesystem read-only (not practical with Windows) then you will quickly get a corrupt filesystem. 
Linux might fare better as you can use one of the alternate filesystems that are optimised for SD flash devices, but NTFS is not a particularly good filesystem for flash devices from what I've heard.
It might last a couple of years, or it might die after a few months. The quality of the card matters, as does the workload of the operating system and the filesystem.
SSDs have features like wear levelling that can prolong the life of the flash device by a great deal by preventing repeated rewrites on the same block in a short period of time.
