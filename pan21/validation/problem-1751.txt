The problem with dual-boot is you can only use one Operating System at a time, and the problem with single-virtulization is you can't use Windows unless Linux is on. 
The problem is your "host" is far from one that would consume zero resources, and is essentially an operating system itself.  You would be better off installing a small distribution of Linux, essentially acting as a "host operating system", and running both of your required operating systems at once.
Hypervisors only work on hardware that has virtualization assistance enabled. Although all of the current processors (intel and amd) support hardware virtualization, some lower end laptops and desktops don't enable this feature (as a means of market segmentation).
Although if you go that far, it's better to simply use the host operating system as opposed to virtualizing itself (i.e. if you use a Windows host, virtualize Linux, and vice-versa).
The only real disadvantage I could think of was performance, which might sometimes matter, but as an example: my next laptop will support 16 GB of RAM, so each system could get a little less than 8 GB of RAM - more than enough.  
A friend of mine recently suggested something that intrigued me: in the case of needing multiple Operating Systems simultaneously, instead of dual-booting or using multiple computers, one could use a low-level host that consumed effectively zero resources that would host two virtual systems. You'd have the benefit of splitting the computer's resources evenly between the systems and the option of using only one system at a time. As an example:
Another alternative is to use Virtual Box or another virtualization system that takes advantage of hardware virtualization but still runs within a host OS.
This dual-virtulization idea seems to solve the problem, but I wonder why I've never heard of it before.
Who decides what OS gets what piece of hardware at what time?  Who manages OS priority?  Who manages who gets what part of memory in the address space?  Who's responsible for managing CPU usage between OSs?  How do you handle storage device read/write synchronization between OSs?
What you're describing sounds like a hyper visor. VMWare and Microsoft both provide thin hypervisors that do little more than provide virtualization services. Also when running windows server 2008 (and 08R2 and now Windows 8 Server and client), you can install hyper-v which still places a hypervisor beneath the "host" OS. From a management standpoint, you still have to run Windows but technically Windows is just a guest to the hypervisor.
From my understanding, the VMWare hypervisor has the smallest footprint, but costs more than  Hyper-V which is free assuming you already have a windows license.
