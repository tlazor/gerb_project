As you can see, both have identical size in pixels. The problem is your physical pixels are smaller than mine, because my 1080p screen is 23.6" big and yours is 15.6". That also makes all stuff on your screen smaller.
This was working well because back then the only reason to buy a higher-res screen was when you needed more workspace. For example my laptop has 15.6" screen with native resolution of 1366x768, but I also have a 23.6" 1080p screen. Both have roughly the same physical size of pixels, so 23.6" one has more pixels, but stuff looks like it's of the same size.
For a long time size of things on desktop PCs has been measured in pixels. For example standard desktop icon size is 48x48 px (or 32x32 px before Vista).
Windows wasn't built with this feature from the beginning. It was introduced at some point, but some apps still can't handle it correctly. That's why scaling doesn't work well for you.
You can either enable scaling or decrease resolution even further. Both will affect graphics quality, but scaling will probably be a bit better.
However, nowadays manufacturing smaller high-res screens is possible and quite cheap, and smaller pixels generally improve visual experience - if software supports them correctly, that is. Mobile operating systems (Android, iOS) measure things in pixel size-relative units, like dpi. It means that stuff will "grow" as physical pixels get smaller to keep final size roughly the same.
