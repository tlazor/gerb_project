The problem is no longer occurring. I still don't know why it occurred but maybe a windows update fixed it. The computer has been unplugged for a long time and on the first few boots there was windows update after windows update.
For the moment the only problems I have is the non USB keyboard not working (maybe a hardware problem) and the boot manager coming up.
I am trying to keep the boot manager from automatically coming up when booting up my Windows Vista computer. I also want to know why the boot manager is coming up.
I have also been having other problems that mite be related. After restarting a few times my USB mouse did not work. After unplugging and plugging back in my mouse worked. But after restarting a few more times each time looking at the options when I press F8, my non USB keyboard stopped working. Unplugging and plugging back did not help. I am now using a USB keyboard.
This computer has not been in use for at least 6 months. When we did finally turn it on it started doing some kind of a repair. When it finished it said that it failed. We restarted and it seemed to work.
