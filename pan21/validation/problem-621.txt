If you are using a third-party tool, contact the vendor.  They may have an update, however it may require a paid upgrade since you did upgrade your infrastructure application.
Adaxes - their new version supports Exchange 2010, automates mailbox creation. But this is paid software, though it has free evaluation period. Consider Exchange System Manager & PowerShell first.
Theses are all tasks that can be accomplished via the native tools that come with exchange 2010 and or basic windows tools.  For instance to create a new user in AD and create a mailbox you would use the new-mailbox cmdlet, as nother example to remove the properties (  I suspect you are refering to the old "remove exchange attributes" option in 2003) use disable-mailbox -Identity Windows.Username from within the management shell.
Microsoft removed the Exchange integrations for Active Directory Users & Computers as of Exchange 2007. If you had the Exchange 2003 plugins, they kind of worked for reviewing settings but shouldn't have been used for changing things. Exchange System Manager and the Exchange Powershell are the methods Microsoft recommends for managing Exchange.
What about the included Exchange System Manager?  That's what it's designed for?  If that is what you're using, you'll need to install the 2010 version.
I would suspect that the reason the tools you were using do not have updates is because they are simply no longer needed as the functionality is easy enough to accomplish with the native tools.
