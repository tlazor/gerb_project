From my understanding Comcast assigns their customers an IP based on not the cable modem's MAC address, but the MAC address of the device next in line within a network. Whenever you connect a device to the modem it's important that you perform a power cycle.
Some ISPs are able to figure out if you're using a router by the vendor code and disconnect you. If they see the MAC as just a NIC, they've got no reason to drop your connection.
MAC address cloning is used because some ISP don't want you to have a router connected to the modem. What usually happens is that when you connect a computer to the modem, your ISP gets your NIC's MAC address and is able to recognize when you connect a router to the modem.
To summarise some ISPs have started to recognize the MAC addresses of popular routers and disconnect service if a router is detected. They want you to buy their expensive wifi routers instead of cheaper retail ones
What you're cloning is the mac address of the computer you had when you signed up with your isp. Therefore every device you now connect to your router shows up to the isp as that original computer.  Therefore it does matter what mac address is cloned
I have a Belkin router, and about a year ago, I suddenly lost my internet connectivity from Comcast.  The internet worked fine when I plugged it right into my laptop, so I just ignored it. When I moved to another apartmnet I eventually took the dive and called tech support.  The tech told me to clone my MAC address which completely fixed the issue.
Now I know what a MAC address is and I've read what MAC cloning is.  What has bothered me since is that I don't see how this fixed the issue.  As I have understood MAC address cloning, it has the router pretend it has the same MAC address as my computer.  Here is why I don't understand why this fixes my issue:
Anyway, I don't have any current problems so this is more just out of general curiosity.  If anybody can explain it, it would be appreciated!
When you clone the MAC address it clones which ever computer you used to connect to your router, you can verify that by going to your command prompt and running "ipconfig /all" you'll see your MAC address there, if you go back to your router's admin panel and compare MAC addresses you'll see that they're the same.
As to why the problem stemmed from nowhere, your guess is as good as mine. Could be because of something Comcast did.
