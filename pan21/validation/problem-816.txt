However, I'm looking forward to learning exciting new tricks if someone knows how to make this work.  Otherwise I'd think you're going to be stuck trying to go through LogMeIn or some similar remote control app rather than VPN.  
To get around this situation, use the FQDN of the remote server - servername.domain.com - to ping and connect.  When you connect to the VPN you will likely obtain IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and (hopefully) DNS server values and a connection-specific DNS suffix for the other domain.  By specifying the FQDN of the server, you are telling it to use the VPN adapter based on the domain instead of relying on the adapter order to determine which network you connect to.
Hmmm - If your local network and the remote network have the exact same IP range and subnet mask, then pinging/connecting by IP to a particular system will likely depend on your adapter order (the order in which your OS looks at your network connections).  For example, say you have your LAN connection and a VPN connection as your network adapter choices.  If your VPN connection adapter is first in the order, when you try to connect to a remote machine by IP, it will connect using the VPN connection and hit the local system.  If your LAN adapter is first, however, it will try locally first and connect to the local system.
If the local and remote networks are sharing an IP range, it seems extremely counterintuitive to me that you could get this to work at all.  Why would a packet destined for your local subnet ever travel to your gateway?  It shouldn't, by definition.
