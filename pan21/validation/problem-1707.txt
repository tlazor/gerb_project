This gives me enough time to click on "New" and then open the drop-down menu before the screenshot is taken.
Now, if you don't have that type of keyboard, then you need a special software probably someone else mentioned already. Good luck!
If so, when you press it, it got a screenshot of 1,2,3 as many monitors you have, a whole full screen, the you use Paint (or called Paintbrush) and you select what you want.
What happened to you, happened to me, but here is the best, the oldest way of all: PrintScreen button (normally top/right area of an standard keyboard) I hope you still have it in your keyboard. Most new nb's keyboard don't have it. Most standard Desktop's keyboard still have it.
Whenever I've needed to do this, I set a delay on the snipping tool - usually between 3 and 5 seconds.
Using the Windows snipping tool, it is not possible (or is it?) to get a screenshot of a drop down menu.  As soon as you select "New" in the snipping tool's toolbar, then the drop down menu disappears.
The delay feature only works for the Windows 10+ version of the snipping because it wasn't introduced until then. For earlier versions, you need to use the cntrl-PrtScr option. Open up the Snipping Tool. If it's active to create a new snip, click cancel or hit the ESC key. Open up the desired menu and press cntl-PrtScr, this will reactivate the Snipping tool but leave the menu open. Then you can select what kind snip you want to make (free form, rectangular, window or full screen) and grab your screenshot.
