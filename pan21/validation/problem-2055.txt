If you want to understand exactly how does the certificate based authentication works, read on at How does Certificate based Authentication work.
Attach Profiler to both instances (all three if there is a witness) and monitor the events Audit Database Mirroring Login Event Class and Broker:Connection Event Class. 
The error 1418  simply tells that within a specific timeout the mirroirng session was not up and running, for whatever reason. When you issue the ALTER DATABASE ... SET PARTNER = 'tcp://..' on the principal the principal will connect to the mirror and the mirror will connect to the principal in response. Which means that both the principal 'partner' value and the mirror 'partner' value, set previously, come into picture, and they both have to be correct and the the underlying infrastucture (routing, DNS, IPSEC, Firewalls) has to allw connection to the desired address:port from both partners. Throw in the witness if you have one and you got yourself a pretty complex hairball of TCP connectivity that has to be verified.
If the issue is certificate security, then the Audit Database Mirroring Login event will clearly state the cause and problem (certificate not valid, expired, bad certificate used etc etc). If the issue is the udnerlying TCP fabric (routing, DNS, IPSEC, firewall etc) then the Broker:Connection event will actually show the problem.
