Well, to be frank I went the simple route and happily used iSCSI over IP over IB and it worked easily and performed well:
I'm very early in the process, and at the moment I'm basically just looking for a tutorial on the level of, "You have two servers on your fabric: here's how to export a block storage device from one to the other."  Preferably on RHEL or variants thereof.  Any pointers?
An iSER implementation for Linux is available via the tgt project and an SRP implementation for Linux is available via the SCST project. Regarding Windows support: at this time there is no iSER initiator driver available for Windows. But an SRP initiator driver for Windows is available in the winOFED software package (see also the openfabrics.org website).
I recently configured SRP target/initiator pair on Linux, and had ~100% performance increase (580MB/s on 10Gbps SDR) over traditional iSCSI-over-IPoIB configuration (300MB/s on SDR).
NOTE: AFAIK, SCST is now obsolete as Linux (kernel) is going with Linux-iSCSI (LIO), obsoleting STGT (previous in-kernel implementation) as well. Plan is to merge SCST features into LIO.
I'm trying to figure out how to set up a simple storage system which exports block storage over Infiniband, using either SRP or iSER.
