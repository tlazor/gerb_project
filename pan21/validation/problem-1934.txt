I'd recommend shipping your logs off to a splunk instance for analysis. It isn't real time, but I believe it can be pretty darn close. The free version will analyze up to 500MB of logfiles each day, which is a pretty busy website.
As the real time logs can be very useful for the stuff that you need, you can pipe them to a database or some real time log analyzer and do the analysis yourself - but I'm not familiar with a specific software solution that does this and writing such a thing would take some serious development.
Webalizer is a very good analysis tool that works on the apache logs - it will give you post-mortem per virtual host with client IPs and a lot of other useful information. It is very not real time though - you're supposed to run it daily on your logs (using cron or something).
As external solution goes, I recommend using ntop which is a realtime network traffic analyzer. It has tons of features so it can take some time to figure out how to work this thing, but it does do full HTTP protocol analysis so it can show you what virtual hosts people are using to hit your site with - both in (near) real time and with history.
I use chartbeat.com to see realtime stats such as number of visitors, etc.  I'm a customer, I don't work for them.  You drop in their javascript code similar to how you drop in google analytics.
