Chrome settings - Install Chrome, run it, close it.  Navigate to \Users\Jim\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome.  Rename the User Data folder (just in case), then copy over the User Data folder from the old drive.  Doesn't always work.
Firefox settings - Install Firefox on the new machine, run it, then close it.  Navigate to \Users\Jim\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles.  You'll find a folder called (random string).default; the random string will be different from the one on your old drive.  Delete the contents of this folder (don't delete the folder, though!) and copy into it the contents of the equivalent folder from the old drive (NOT the actual folder!).
I would not, under any circumstances, attempt to simply copy over the \Users folder!  And unfortunately, without being able to do that (or use Easy Transfer), you're just not going to get everything.
One last thing: some of this will cause Windows to complain that you don't have the necessary permissions.  The easiest thing is to use a tool like Robocopy or RichCopy.
Other programs may store their settings locally (in which case you're in luck) or in the Registry (in which case you may be SOL). Of course, you can load individual hives of the old Registry and copy some settings, but 1) it's a huge pain 2) it's very hard to be sure you're getting everything and 3) if the drive is failing, I wouldn't recommend loading hives from it.  I honestly don't know what would happen if the old drive failed in the middle of operations and left the Registry with orphaned entries, but I wouldn't want to find out on a machine I actually cared about.
However, you can get pretty close.  Here are the things I've been able to transfer in similar circumstances  (I'll call the individual user "Jim"; of course you'll substitute the name(s) of the real user(s):
Run Firefox again, and you should have ALL of your old settings - bookmarks, plugins, saved passwords, etc.
