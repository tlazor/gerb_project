In scenario 2 your PC gets all he needs (IP address, network mask, router, DNS server(s)) from the router. In scenario 2 your PC gets most he needs (IP address, network mask, router) from the router, but you override the DNS server(s) to use. The router might still tell the PC which DNS server(s) he can use, but the PC will ignore that and use the ones you configured.
When a client needs an IP address for the google search engine, it will ask the bind server which is configured into the network config for that workstation.  If this bind server does not know google's IP (or range of IP's) then it may inquire from any of the 4 Google bind servers.  It will then cache the answer should anyone else need to know Google's IP so that Google's bind servers do not get hit every time someone needs the IP.
These servers have one IP address each, although there may be load balancers spreading the requests to a farm.
If you change the DNS server(s) at your PC, this will only affect this PC, no other PC and not the router. If you change the DNS server(s) at your router this will affect the router itself and all PCs that learn the DNS server(s) from the router.
I am not sure if Google DNS really is faster. My hope would be that a good provider knows what he is doing and that you profit from the short way from your router to your ISP's DNS server, a way that is totally under control of the ISP and could be optimized. If you want to check which DNS is fastest, you can use namebench.
The third reason probably is a good one. If you live in a country with censorship and/or DNS filtering then some DNS names might not be blacklisted and not be resolved by your ISP. Your ISP might not have a choice because of legal reasons. In this case a Google DNS that is (or claims to be) uncensored/unfiltered is a good alternative to get full internet access. Of course this might not work in all countries because the ISPs might also be obliged to filter out traffic from/to Google DNS.
How does your router know the DNS server(s) from your ISP? Because your router uses DHCP to talk to your ISP and get it's IP address, ... and the DNS server(s). The ISP will tell your router to use his own DNS server(s). As with PCs some routers allow providing alternate DNS server(s) as override.
Second reason is a more secure DNS, but also this depends on your ISP and the DNS server they are using.
The answer is yes: your OS will use whatever DNS servers you tell it to.  The modem is given some DNS servers by the ISP, and it will then serve them to its clients via DHCP, but the clients are free to ignore tham and use alternative servers if they wish.
Yes, the DNS is a service of choice, you can choose the DNS you want on end user, you can even create a static DNS on your host.
By the way, I doubt that speed is relevant. DNS resolving is taking milliseconds. And if the PC once resolved a name to an IP address, he caches this information for some time. So a second DNS resolve request only a few seconds later will not result in any packet being sent to any DNS server. You can see the list of cached DNS names if you want to: start cmd.exe and there enter ipconfig /displaydns).
