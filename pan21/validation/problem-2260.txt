Make sure you check in your .meta files as this is what Unity uses to reference each asset. You can make them unhidden in your OS by going to Edit->Project Settings->Editor and changing Version Control to Visible Meta Files.
The file type is less important that the file's purpose and origin; as you said, anything that can be generated from the source files under version control (usually) has no business being included in the repository itself.
If you are storing your unity project in a folder called UnityProjectName, this is what your .gitignore should look like. If you just have the Unity project folder as the root of the GitHub repo, just remove the UnityProjectName/ from each path below.
You can take a look at my Unity project, Radius, on GitHub as an example. Or checkout the Unity.gitignore file in the official GitHub gitignore repo.
I don't know about unity but you mentioned visual studio. There you can usually exclude the bin and obj folders in the project folders (in some project types, the bin folder also stores assemblies from included projects, but I think this only applies for certain type of web projects).
With the current version of Unity, just check in anything in the Assets folder and ProjectSettings folder.  Don't check in anything under Library, or at the top level.
Also do not check in the ".csproj.user" and ".suo" files. Those two types include user settings. If you check those in, then all user settings will be reflected on the other machines, when you update the source. This is quite annoying, as those settings are not build or project relevant but more to configure the ui, editor etc for each developers individual needs.
