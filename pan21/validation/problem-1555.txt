Whoa! that's very high. The average queue length should be equal to, or less than, the number of physical disk spindles, so your machine is thrashing about an order of magnitude above where it should be. This link has the list of all the Exchange operations that cause disk I/O, so along with Sam & Evan's suggestions you should verify that you don't have unusual amounts of any of those activities (like a mail loop).
You might also look at Process Monitor, which logs each access on the disk individually.  If something other than Exchange is using your disks, you'll see it fill the list of disk accesses very quickly in ProcMon.
You don't mention how much RAM you have, although the specs you did mention indicate you probably have a reasonable amount.  If you're running less than 2 GB, you might see this kind of behavior from the machine hitting the page file.  Make sure the amount of RAM used in Task Manager is less than the amount of physical memory installed in the server.  
I would first download process explorer and use it to see what process is actually causing the high disk IO, is it the information store, or something else. Then you can go on from there.
Also, you have probably already checked this, but is your RIAD array ok, if its rebuilding from a failed disk that can cause significant disk IO.
It would be useful to know how much mail you are are actually processing, as 95 mail boxes is not a huge amount, but if there all in constant user then it could be an issue.
That is rather high, do you have any kind of AV software?  Also look at \process*\io data operations/sec.  That should tell you if it's store.exe or somehting else that causing the IO.  If it's store.exe I'd guess that something is scanning thru your mailboxes.
