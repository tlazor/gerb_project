You might consider installing Dropbox on each of the workstations. It is designed for personal use, but it seems like it would be a good fit for your scenario. For data under 2GB, it's free. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
All depend on your workload. If it's occasional updating and not too large, use Google Sites and just load the files onto the file cabinet or as attachments. Or other similar web based solution, like Basecamp. If you have frequent updates or very large files, then you can try setup a server like others have suggested. 
Dropbox has been working great for at least a year now (in private beta) and many people have entrusted them with their data. Even so, you would be well-advised to keep separate backups of your Dropbox in case anything ever happens to the system.
I would set up (2) servers at the main location.   One server running Active Directory and all things related, file storage, backup, etc.  The second server would be used for a Terminal Server for the remote users.  They would use this for accessing the accounting software, office files, internet browsing if you wish.  At this point, you now have the option of having all users from both offices use terminal services or just the remote.  
I would honestly consider using Terminal Services for the smaller office.  Depending on the accounting software's ability to effectively work over a WAN / VPN connection, you could easily saturate your internet connections.  Before going this route, verify with accounting software vendor that they fully support the application in a TS environment.
The service automatically synchronizes the Dropbox folder on each workstation with only a few seconds lag, and provides graphical indicators about the upload/download progress.
With Linux instead of Windows Server you could use DRBD + OCFS2 for filesystem replication, and OpenVPN for site-to-site VPN. Then throw Samba on top of the shared volume so the local systems can access the files.
