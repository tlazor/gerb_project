and then use the regular Accounts preferences to set automatic login to that account, and you should be set.
You can create a LoginHook script to reset the user's home folder on every login.  Mike Bombich has some example scripts, including one that simply resets an account every login, and one that resets but saves the old home folder to /tmp in case you need to recover previous work.  You'll probably want to edit the script a bit to change which user(s) are affected (the first only resets if the account name is "student", the second for anything except "admin"), and maybe what it uses as a template for the reset account (by default, both use the standard system template, /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj -- you can customize this folder to taste, but it's also what gets used for newly created accounts, so you might want a separate template for the reset account).  Be a bit careful with this script, as it'll run as root before each login session for ALL users -- if you get it too seriously wrong, it could wipe your account as well and/or keep you from logging in at all.
