I had a pretty good on-board HDMI output on my CAD box of the moment and was taking my computer back and forth with me to work. I had spare peripherals at home and work, so it was only the box. At work I was using a 24" DVI monitor and at home is a higher end 42" Sony HDTV. I was given (as in for free, like free beer) a Quadro FX3800. It was waaay more than I needed, but a customer saw me talk about my problems and gave me a factory hook-up. I'm in the 2nd or 3rd week working on my CAD project at home and I see something... off the corner of my model... zoom zoom zoom zoom oh wow, there's trash hanging out there I didn't notice before! Those last two zooms were impossible to "see" before the new card. 
OK, so I gave all this advice. Here's my CAD computer. What's sad is that I humbly say "yeah it's ok", when it's a stonkin epic computer. The only thing(s) I bought new for it were the RAM and the AMD GPU. The rest was legacy stuff from other computers. 
I consider 4G to be insufficient for anything more than having a browser and one or two office programs open. Check out the performance monitor, you'll see. The problem is, you need to pay attention to the Windows OS version and its RAM limits. Right off, you need to be on 64 bit version of the OS. You can get 8GB in Win7 Home Basic. That's a great first step. (Reference) Sadly, Home Premium limits you to 16G, so anything at work that does more than office-y stuff has to run Win 7 64 Pro. Speed or version of RAM is almost irrelevant imho. You're not overclocking or benchmarking. If 2G or 4G is holding you back, the cheapest 8G is going to feel like a Ferrari.
This is the tough one. Once the above two are assuredly not holding you back, this is the last continent to explore. If I hadn't personally seen what a Quadro workstation card can do, I would not be a believer in graphics cards. 
My Experience: I've gone from dual core to core 2 duo to 6 core to xeon 4 core (dual thread), all of them overclocked. I like to punish the program than switch to something else and stay productive while my task has the CAD program go all white.
*Next time** I'm buying a server-type motherboard that can have even more RAM. The more ram you've got, the less programs need to "think" it seems. Get enough and you can make a RAM disk and save your files there, too. Win7Pro goes up to 192G; that's bigger than my SSD! After that, I'd get whatever processor has the highest "boost" speed and not care about cores. 4 or more are all the same unless you're certain your tasks are using those extra cores.
When your app is single threaded and can't use more cores, you need the newest architecture you can afford, the fastest clock speed possible, but with the least cores available. That means get a Core i3 with 3GHz+ clock speed. Mentioning Core i3 may not be the most current advice: google site:overclock.net about CPU performance. And Intel all the way. IMHO, AMD is great for servers (I have a 1055t in mine) but Intel for desktops.
Start with Lawrence's advice on checking the CPU in performance monitor. Most programs are sadly single threaded. If this is the case, then more cores just empties your wallet. I use Rhinoceros 3D for CAD and it is almost always single threaded (only uses 1 core). 
When doing CAD-like stuff, see if the 3D Connexion Space Navigator works in your software! OMG, I love it so much I bought a 2nd one to sit at home for the few times I do CAD at home on my laptop. It is like flying a helicopter through your drawing; you can get the view exactly on what you're doing! I have found so many minuscule defects where edges don't meet up properly via this + a good GPU.
Caveat: when you're maxing out that program and only have 2 cores, make sure THAT is the only program running. You can alt-tab over to your Firefox with 30 tabs open and play candy crush. 
But, I didn't talk about rendering per-se, zooming in and re-drawing is a cousin to rendering, so we could be talking about the same thing or semantics has us in separate topics when it comes to GPU performance. You need to talk to technical support at the manufacturer of the software you're using and find out exactly what video hardware they have observed in their own lab to appear to be the best performance at realistic pricing. From my experience, they'll do their best to help because then you'll like them more and keep on buying their products.
RAM? 16G was enough for a long while. Then I got the laser scanner which upped the ante a LOT for filesize. :P There are 4 slots in the motherboard with 4 4GB sticks. So I went to 4 8GB sticks. If you buy memory, buy 8GB sticks so you only need to buy TWO to upgrade from 16G to 32G!! 
I've been down this journey a few times via various paths... and I'm still not exactly satisfied with the results. Now, on to the arms race of "graphics" performance:
I almost commented on Lawrence's answer, but reconsidered as my thoughts stand as an answer on their own.
The core i7 was from a Gateway store-box computer. It was the only thing worth beans in that whole computer. I bought a core i3 for it and it's a spare workstation for guests now. The Motherboard had only 2 slots and I recall was limited to 4G of RAM. :P I ganked it's CPU when I saw a core i3 on OCN for sale, which I put in my CAD box.
The AMD GPU was on a special sale where they gave me a gift card for buying it. The only reason I bought it was when I moved my Quadro to the latest build, it stopped working. Got me why. I researched and the W5000 was the best performance for the money at the moment.
