Then theres always the case of "I'll do it" - someone who isn't responsible for a system suggests an improvement that they will look after, then they leave and the sysadmin has to pick it up.
At that point, you should build a solid logical, financial, and pragmatic case to counter his broken practices and you should suggest a few alternatives (NB: complaining without suggesting solutions is called 'whining'.) At the very minimum, get a copy of "The Practice of System and Network Administration" and start looking for best practices. Put your concerns down in writing. Each organization has different attitudes toward 'argument from authority' (e.g. do textbook best-practices trump those from the local sysadmin or management or developers or Marketing?) If possible, leave a way for the senior admin to 'save face' to make it easier for them to change, without necessarily admitting they were wrong.)
You could also ask the sysadmin why he does things a certain way as perhaps what you see as a rookie mistake is actually sensible for some other reasons that you don't know.
Maybe instead of fixing the issues yourself, getting involved in "helping" fix the issues is the way to go.
Maybe you need to find out why their doing something that way first, rather than just trying to "prove" them wrong.  It may be that there is some service that requires a dropping of security.
Once you have a little backing, you can be a little more confident that your observations on security should be handed down to the sysadmin, and that conforming with policy should be more strictly adhered to.
Inform your manager that you disagree with this and here's why and the risks associated with that.  Keep hard copies of what was sent just in case it becomes necessary to defend that you brought up this concern and it was discarded.  This also assumes the sysadmin isn't in your line to the executive where you are.
Without going into detail, this is definitely an issue to take to management if it can't be addressed effectively with the individual in question. I would try to engage the other person and give him the opportunity to explain his rationale', however, given the arrogance and ego often found in our industry, it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't appreciate such challenges to his "authoritay."
In my experience, you need a champion (direct supervisor) to be aware of this situation, and understand the implication of not being "on the team".
I wouldn't worry so much about not 'being on the team'; it's one thing to be a destructive, disruptive or obstructionist element; it's quite another to make change a positive experience for everyone involved. That said, depending on how dysfunctional your organization is, your choices may be to change your job or change your job - either fix it or find someplace else less broken. That's probably an extreme case though; keep it depersonalized and positive, listen more than you speak, and above all keep a paper trail. :)
It's always easy to suggest "improvements" if you're not resposible for a system - but I find one of the biggest factors to stability is unnecessary change, and the more changes people want the less stable a system become.
Those would be my suggestions along with noting that if you seem to meet a lot of resistance, you may just become apathetic to the whole thing.
