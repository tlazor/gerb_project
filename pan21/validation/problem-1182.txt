I'm quite experienced in running Firefox and Firefox beta side-by-side with different profiles. The trick is to make sure you don't download the installer 'stub' which is about 300kb in size and does everything automatically without offering any options.
In order to do that you need to install the newer version in a different folder/drive. If you don't explicitly change it the installer will default to the default Firefox installation folder. 
Even when you're installing a beta, it defaults to Program Files\Mozilla Firefox so make sure you change it to something like Mozilla Firefox Beta and rename your shortcuts accordingly. When that's done, you can have both running simultaneously by ensuring your profiles.ini is set to always show the profile manager on startup (or you can set this as a one-off by running firefox -profilemanager).
You need to make sure you always download the full installer from the 'All languages and platforms' section of the regular/beta download pages. When you do this, you'll get the 'full' installer that doesn't download anything and will prompt you for where to install it.
