Otherwise, read manual pages for the init system you have on Kali to find out the way to enable a service at startup.
Though it has already been answered, here is a good resource for setting up a headless RPi with Kali. I am currently running a Pi in headless mode following the guide. https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/set-up-headless-raspberry-pi-hacking-platform-running-kali-linux-0176182/
I had the same issue some minutes ago. The issue is sourced in the fact that the Kali ARM image (in my case 2018.1 -> https://images.offensive-security.com/arm-images/kali-linux-2018.1a-rpi3-nexmon.img.xz) is shipped without ssh host keys (for a good reason!). Therefore ssh denies access - in more detail: I got a "Connection closed by 10.0.0.8 port 22" which made my curious.
The trick with the /boot/ssh file is specific to Raspbian, so it won't work on Kali. You'll have to find a way to configure your system to start sshd automatically. If you still happen to have /etc/init.d, then creating a symlink named S99sshd inside /etc/rc3.d/ and pointing to /etc/init.d/sshd should do the trick.
To become able to access the PI without keyboard, mouse and display (this was my situation) via ssh you need to create new host keys. But how to do this headlessly?
Cron is going to execute the command "dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server" every minute. This command will create the missing host keys. And this is the trick.
As soon as you have logged in via ssh don't forget to edit /etc/crontab again and to remove the line containing "dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server" previously added. Otherwise your host keys will be re-created every minute.
