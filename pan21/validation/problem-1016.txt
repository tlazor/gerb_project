The main advantage to keeping your workstations and servers on separate subnets really has more to do with security.  That way you can put up a firewall between the two, and keep random "passers by" on your workstation network plugging in their home laptop, iPad, or whatever, and endangering the privacy/security of your servers.
Since you are using a private address range, I assume you are behind a NAT firewall/router.  Most SOHO routers use a netmask of 255.255.255.0 and can not be changed.  If you can configure your router to use 255.255.0.0, then your idea will work, but not otherwise.
You can't really put your phones on 192.168.1.x/255.255.255.0 and everything else on 192.168.x.x/255.255.0.0, because you have overlapping network definitions, then.  I mean... it might work, at least in some cases (for some network stacks, etc), but it's not the "right" way to do it.
Would I need to change the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0 on all devices? Or only those that change? For example, the phones don't need to connect to any other devices other than other phones and the phone server. So if I have the phones on 192.168.1.XXX with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and then moved everything I had complete ownership/control of to 192.168.X.XXX with a new subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. 
As I am slowly exploring new server OS's and virtualisation etc. I am getting close to wanting a wider range of IP addresses. 
My biggest concern is the phones and subnet masks. The phones are managed by our provider although I have access to the server that runs them. 
If your printers use DHCP, you may want them on the same network as the workstations... Or you could set up two physical ethernet segments (or even three)--one for workstations, one for phones, one for printers.  I'm not sure what the advantage would be here.  And many VoIP phones act as a one-port ethernet switch, to allow the phone and PC to connect where only one ethernet jack is present. If you use this feature, you'll need your phones and workstations on the same physical LAN anyway. (And if you don't use this, you need to account for people who might choose to plug a PC into their phone's ethernet port--whether out of convenience, ignorance, or malice).
We currently have a few servers, around 30-40 workstations and 16 phones. Each device has a static IP address. 
My advice would be to keep your subnets small, but use several of them if necessary.  And try to separate them physically.  It's annoying (although certainly not impossible) to have multiple subnets over the same physical wire--especially when more than one tries to use DHCP.
Traditionally, there are problems with really large subnets in Windows workstation environments, because of the amount of broadcast traffic they transmit. Although I think that's really more related to the actual number of Windows PCs, than to the subnet. Maybe a Windows expert can shed more light on this area.
So in a nutshell... to me, the main reason to subnet (before running out of address space) is for security, not for extra addresses.  That doesn't mean it's the only valid school of thought.
As for whether it is common; no, most people just use DHCP to auto assign addresses rather than try to track static assignments by hand.
Public here would be used if you have a wireless network, or ethernet jacks in a conference room that visiters can use--you want these to be isolated physically, so you can run a more strict firewall here, and keep strangers from sniffing your ethernet traffic, or using less restricting firewall settings to get into your server, or downloading porn, or whatever other mischief they might find to do.
The reason I put servers and VMs on the same network is because they're likely in the same physical room.  But you could potentially split them.
