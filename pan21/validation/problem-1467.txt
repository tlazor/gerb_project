If you can put another SATA controller in, or else if the motherboard already features more than one SATA controller, I'd move the drives from the controller they were on to a new one, and see if that makes a difference. I have an X58 board that features a standard SATA II controller integrated, with another integrated Marvell controller for SATA III functionality. The Marvell controller is such an absolute dog that it regularly underperforms the SATA II controller, and on top of that actually has caused BSODs and corruption on more than one occasion. Moving my drives to the SATA II controller and an Asmedia PCI-E Sata controller addon card stopped the issues immediately.
It's also running Windows 10, with an Intel Core i7 2600K (sandy bridge) CPU running in a Gigabyte GA-Z68X-UD3-B3 Z68 Socket 1155.
I've recently had 2 7200RPM SATA Disk Drives go in the span of about 2 months. The first i put down to an old drive so i removed it and took the hit. The second was not so old.
After inspecting the first drive it looks like the partition structure was corrupted. I've managed to restore it and the drive looks ok. I've yet to run a full test on the drive to validate it's ok.
So I would check the ventilation in your case, check fans are working, and check the drives are not too close together (if you can).
