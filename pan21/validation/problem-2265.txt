I've recently purchased a set of components and set about building my own desktop.  It is not booting and I am stuck.
I have other components, but I have not yet begun to connect them. I assume I should be getting some video or beeps or something, even if I don't have a hard drive hooked up.
When I hit the power button, the fans spin, but that's all. There is no video. There are no beep codes.
I have tried swapping out the processor.  My backup processor is an AMD FX-4100 AM3+.  Both processors are brand new.
I have 2 pieces of RAM, each 8 GB.  I have four RAM slots. I have tried the RAM singly and in pairs, in all fourteen possible combinations of RAM + Slot.  I have tried this RAM in another computer, and it was able to boot Windows.
Because I was able to swap out all components other than the motherboard itself, I thought that the motherboard must be faulty. I RMA'd it and got a new one, of the same model. This did not fix the problem.
I have tried swapping out the power supply.  My backup power supply is 850W.  Both power supplies are brand new.
I have tried swapping out the video card. My backup video card is a Sapphire Radeon HD 4650 PCI Express. It was working in the last computer it was in.  This motherboard does not have on-board video.
