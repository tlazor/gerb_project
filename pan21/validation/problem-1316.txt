In that case, from within windows, plug in the usb stick. Browse the stick and launch setup (if it doesn't already launch by itself). It will ask you if you want to upgrade windows to the version that is on the stick and keep your files and everything in tact.
I want to do this offline as i have limited data. I have enough data to download builds but windows update is slow (stops for no reason sometimes) and doesn't manage data well. So the only option left to me is offline.
I suggest finding a place where you can get unlimited data.  A friend with a dedicated Internet line, for instance.  In the USA, public libraries, coffeeshops, hotels, and many other places often have free wifi.  You can use the Media Creation Tool there to save the ISO, and then burn it to a DVD or thumb drive at your leisure.  Alternately, you can just run Windows Update normally while present in the free spot.
If your computer does not already have windows, you can boot from the stick to install a fresh copy of windows, directly to this version. But you mentioned you already have windows installed.
After the stick has been downloaded, this becomes your installation medium for that specific version of windows. From any version of windows, you can upgrade to this version using that usb stick, although you cannot downgrade from a later version of windows to this version.
Tried windows 10 update assistant but it gets stuck mid-way and fails to resume. My bad luck is a major ongoing factor.
All you need to do is download the Media Creation Tool and run it on a pc with sufficient bandwidth. It will then ask you if you want to update the current pc, or that you want to create an offline installer. You select the offline installer. You can then save it to an .ISO file or write it directly to a USB stick that can be booted from. If you have that stick ready, using the USB stick method is recommended.
