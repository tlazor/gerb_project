I've seen these paths before but never understood them, and searching for them didn't yield the information I wanted to find.
The AppData\Local and AppData\Roaming locations are the preferred locations for applications to store data which is not required to be exposed to the user. In a domain environment the Roaming folder is used to copy the user's environment as they log on to different computers.
What does the percent sign mean in filepaths on Windows (as opposed to navigating via C:\Users\etc), and what are the folders AppData and LocalAppData?
As others explained, these are Environmental Variables which can be listed at the Windows Command Prompt using the SET command.
Just enter %AppData% or %LocalAppData% in the address bar of File Explorer and it will take you to the folders.
I just recently followed some instructions to reset GitHub for Windows by deleting two folders in the explorer found under %AppData% and %LocalAppData% respectively.
%WORD% is how cmd.exe (and Windows in general) does variables. So %AppData% is the variable name for the application data directory.
