I am developing a web application and am running into the dreaded host xxx blocked because of many connection errors message. There have been numerous questions on SO pertaining to this error and common wisdom is to flush hosts to clear the error and then bump up MySQL's max_connections setting in order to avoid this issue in the future. A summary of the issue from the MySQL manual is as follows:
The advice you've seen about max_connections is a distraction from the issue you're seeing, because it has nothing to do with connection errors.
Starting with MySQL 5.6, the content of the server internal 'host cache' can be inspected in the performance schema.
I'd like to go a step further and determine the root cause of the issue for my application. I am relatively new to MySQL and would like to know what is the best way to trap such errors - does MySQL provide any logs or information as to which connections or queries failed or are the any tracing tools I can use to ascertain this information? 
run select * from performance_schema.host_cache; chances are, you'll have records for the host that is experiencing problems. you can use this page to figure out what each column means. In my case, I had EC2 instances communicating across a VPC Peering connection and my DBs were failing the hosts with COUNT_NAMEINFO_PERMANENT_ERRORS so i was able to add skip-name-resolve to my my.cnf, restart and everything worked great. 
if you're using MySQL >= 5.6, then you can potentially use the information I did to resolve my situation without increasing max_connect_errors.
