Check out Spiceworks. Its free, easy to use, and light-weight. It has a help desk system and asset management. The community around it is very helpful and there are a ton of 3rd party add-ons that extend its capabilities. After installing it and letting it scan your network, you will be surprised at the information it returns.
I've been using Lansweeper for about 6 months now.  It's extremely easy to deploy, it scans easily and seems to be pretty stable.  They have a free version (which I use) that is very feature-rich, but the paid version might offer some additional features that you would find useful.  The license for the paid version is a one-time fee of $200.
For something that small, why not a spreadsheet on Google Docs?  It's web-based, can be shared, has access controls, revision history, color coding, etc.  I use that for IP address management on smaller network subnets and it does a fine job.  Just keep a current printout handy somewhere in case they have an outage or your Internet goes down for a while and you need immediate access to look something up.
I have been using zendesk as a light-weight web-based help desk application for my organization (15 employees; 25 machines), and I am quite happy with it, however they don't currently have any asset management.
