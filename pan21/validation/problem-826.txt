Chrome and Firefox support the notion of HTTP Strict Transport Security Preload Lists which are lists of sites which should only be contacted via HTTPS, even if referenced with a HTTP URL.
When i open my web browser and type in the address: stackexchange.com, it first performs a DNS query, receives an answer, and then sends a TCP Syn packet to proper IP address at port 80.
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge address this limitation by implementing a "HSTS preloaded list", which is a list that contains known sites supporting HSTS.
Otherwise, there had to be a http request and the server would have had to redirect to https (in case of HSTS, the server responds with header - use only HTTPS: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000).
Note that i don't type in http://stackexchange.com or https://www.paypal.com, but simply stackexchange.com and www.paypal.com.
The browser usually tries HTTP first, then gets a redirect to HTTPS. That's the common case, but not the only one. 
The DNS answer doesn't seem to include destination port, neither is there any protocol negotiation between my browser and target site. How does my browser know destination port?
So, the request from your browser goes to the respective HSTS configured server domain directly on https.
But when i type in www.paypal.com, it does the same but TCP Syn packet is sent directly to port 443.
