With a hub you effectively have the same arrangement, the hub is fairly dim just more convenient to connect things to. You still have a single collision domain so at most one machine is sending a packet at a time. Some hubs have small buffers which would allow them to more efficiently handle collisions than the individual machines on the network leg would between them, but you still have a single collision domain because the hub doesn't selectively send packets: every packet sent still goes to all machines on that leg so only one device can talk at once.
Devices that use Linux tend to do achieve this functionality with the help of a kernel feature called "ethernet bridging".
With a switch there is more intelligence in the switching device: all machines can be talking to it at once and it has the internal bandwidth and store-and-forward buffers to push the packets between each. A switch will know which machines are connected to which port so can send ethernet packets to just the machine that needs it instead of every one. This essentially means that you have one collision domain per connected device. With a hub, the effective throughput of the network leg degrades massively as more machines try to talk at the same time even if no two machines are talking to the same other machine, with a switch this is not the case.
With (wired) ethernet, you can have switched because you can have a non-shared medium (individual cables not all hard-wired together like they would be in a hub). With wireless, you inherently have a shared medium...
Switching hubs exist and are a hybrid needed because with a hub each connected machine needs to be talking the same protocol and speed. A 10/100mbps switching hub for instance would effectively (or actually) be two hubs (one at each speed) with a two port switch or router sat between them. Really simple switching hubs actually had different ports for the different speeds, but must had the intelligence required to allow any physical port to connect to either side depending on the speed the machine at the other end tried to connect at. With this you still effectively have a single collision domain.
The closest concept to a wireless switch is a signal booster or repeater, which are devices that do pretty much exactly what they sound like.  Nobody calls them a switch though, because they're technically hubs (which are usually called repeaters when they only join two network segments), not switches.  WiFi has a single shared medium, you can't selectively broadcast to only one 'port' because everything is on a single 'port', so it's a hub not a switch.  It's pretty rare to see these devices outside of very specific circumstances though, as it's almost always better to extend the network using a wired connection and multiple wireless access points with the same SSID.
Wi-Fi routers are switches. Consider the situation of multiple devices connected to a single access point. That access point defines a single wireless LAN, on which the packets are switched among the devices. The devices are not on different network segments with their own IP subnet; they are all in 192.168.0.1/8 or whatever.
Wi-Fi switching products are integrated as multi-function devices that provide routing so they are called and sold-as Wi-Fi routers.
The reason you don't see wireless switches, is that you generally only have one "wire": the small patch of universe between the devices that are taking part in the network - all devices share the same universe so share the same collision domain s oonly one can send a packet at once. You can have multiple "wires" with wireless by using multiple distinct sets of radio frequencies, allowing different devices to talk on at the same time if they do so on different frequency sets. This is why there are several ranges in each wireless standard - you can set your network to use one while your neighbour uses another and your devices won't interferee with each other. Some wireless access points support protocols that allow different devices to use different frequencies on the same network, but unless you have only a small number of devices and there are no local competing networks using the same frequency ranges, you won't get one collision domain per device like you do with a wired switch (just one collision domain per frequency range).
The typical Wi-Fi router can switch packets between the wireless LAN and the wired one; a mixture of wired and wireless clients can be on the same subnet.
Note, however, that the term 'router' isn't always an accurate description of what most people call wireless routers.  Most of them are capable of just acting a a bridge instead of a router, and it's not all that unusual to see them used in this way (for example, the guest network where I work is handled through a wireless AP configured as a bridge, with the actual routing being handled by our gateway systems).
A router connects two network legs as separate collision domains. This might be two wired networks using the same protocol, network legs using different protocols, or a wired leg and a wireless one, etc. A standard wireless access point is a router by this definition. An AP with multiple ethernet ports is actually two devices in the same box: a switch and the AP. A bridge is similar but it connects the two networks as a single leg - wireless extenders operate like this, bridging to wireless network legs, and a switching hub is effectively a bridge too.
In wired networking way back when, all machines on a particular leg were connected to the same wire and had to take it in terns somehow to send packets. Various schemes existed to manage this including token ring and the "just try, and back off for a random time in the case of a collision" where a collision is where two machines try to use the line at the same time.
