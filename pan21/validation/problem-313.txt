I can see your Wi-Fi adapter is a Qualcomm Atheros AR956x card - the drivers for which are here. Download and install the latest drivers. To find if you have a static IP, when looking at "Wi-Fi Properties", as in your screenie above, click on "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)", and then click on the "Properties" button for it. If you have a static IP, there'll be a selection of numbers in the format of "##.##.##.##" in the text boxes. If not, then you don't have a static IP and everything should be OK in that department.
I suddenly started getting this error without having changed anything. I tried everything I could think of on my PC, including forgetting the network, updating the driver, rebooting, etc but nothing worked.
Hopefully, the driver update should fix it as I have seen articles of people with the same adapter not being able to connect to wireless, but after updating are able to connect.
