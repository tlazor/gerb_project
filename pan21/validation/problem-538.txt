Tools: VMware is king here.  VirtualCenter, Lab Manager, LifeCycle Manager, Backup Assistants.  Citrix/Xen is only just starting to build tools of this functionality (although the VMware tools CAN be horribly buggy at times). 
VMware: As you're probably aware VMware is the long-standing king of virtualization. It has the biggest list of compatible guest OSs, and has one significant unique feature - memory overcommit (you can allocate more virtual memory than there is physical memory). If your goal is to consolidate a bunch of small, underutilized servers VMware will likely give you more VMs/host than anything else. The caveat is that if you overcommit and the VMs need more resources performance tanks. ESX/ESXi also has the smallest list of compatible hardware. If you are looking at a white-box system, check here first. If you have compatible hardware it's fairly easy to install and use. The free version (ESXi) comes with hardly any features, which is fine if you're looking for a few standalone hosts, and the non-free versions are priced out of this world. On a personal note, I VMware leaves a nasty taste in my mouth - in my mind they are one of the many companies resist change & innovation when the very foundation of their business is challenged by the competition. Recently they asked a partner company to remove their product's support for the free version.
Questions like this always end up being a religious decision.  For the most part all three of these platforms have their strengths and weaknesses.  Looking over everyone else's answers it's pretty clear that each person has their choice of platform regardless of the facts...
I recently took all three for a spin to run my home network, and the short answer is that it depends on your particular needs. Unless your needs are very specialized (database/Exchange/etc), modern hardware with virtualization support you will run the guests with negligible performance differences. Given that I'd suggest looking at features & price.
I don't have much experience with Hyper-V, but from what I have seen and heard, it's the classical MS market-entry: it's just good enough, but don't expect anything fancy (like proper live migration, without any strings attached). My personal opinion: if you value you machines' uptime, don't do this. The technology just isn't mature enough yet.
Lastly, I would suspect that all vendors are going to end up offering the base Hypervisor for free and the profit will come from management and add-ons.
Xen is built into a lot of free Linux distributions, but in such a setup, it is a little more complicated than VMware to manage. A little, not much, especially if your shop is not too big. All major distros have Xen and / or KVM these days: CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora. If you want paid support, RHEL and SLES provide it. Xen has a huge userbase, just like VMware and yes, you can get it for free, though your evident lack of experience urges me to suggest you buy proper support for it. I would recon Xen's price / quality ratio is a little better than VMware's.
Enterprise virtualization decisions really need to be made with product comparisons and considerations of the product road-map.
Hyper-V synthetic interfaces are bound to the hypervisor, and the Hyper-V product has most everything (if not all) you will find on other platforms.
VMware is market leader for a reason. It's easy to manage, even if you do not have much virtualization experience. It's stable, fast, mature, scalable and expensive. Probably the best product you can get.
Microsoft: Hyper-V is a very intriguing option, even more with the R2 version. I tested Hyper-V Server, which is the free standalone product. I'm a Microsoft fan, and I really wanted to like Hyper-V, primarily because it can run on practically any hardware that has Windows drivers. If you are running in a domain environment and primarily use Windows, Hyper-V should be at the top of your list. When you have the option to buy/use SCVMM it appears to be an even better value. Unlike VMware, the free version comes with a good feature set and is even better in R2, where clustering & live migration are available! Hyper-V runs Windows guests very well, has a small, but growing, list of supported Linux guests, and even unenlightened Linux guests seem to run reasonably well. The story is different if you aren't in a domain environment as managing the standalone Hyper-V Server is a major pain. Despite all of the goods Microsoft delivered in a v1 product, the management was driving me crazy.
Citrix: The end result of my testing was to go with XenServer 5.5. It has IMHO the best set of features and capabilities of the three free offerings. Like VMware it is installed and managed like an appliance rather than an operating system (like Hyper-V). It also has a much larger list of compatible hardware (and I suspect the ability to add drivers if needed). It offers way more features than VMware's free offering, and if you were to upgrade the free version to the paid version would cost much, much less. Windows guests are well supported, but Linux guests are, well, not what you'd expect from a Linux-based virtualization platform. Its list of supported Linux guests is quite small compared to VMware and non-supported Linux guests don't seem to run well at all. Ubuntu is noticeably lacking from the list. Overall for home use I felt that it had the best bang for the buck.
