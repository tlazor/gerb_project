Just my own take on the code, it may not be what you were thinking, but it too gracefully handles if there are multiple or no instances of hero-action.
Note: I'm not just checking for the entire string because the CMS is generating the <p>...</p> block with some weird amount of whitespace and I was struggling to match spaces, newlines, etc.
Like I said, it works it just feels dumb. I know I could make an anonymous self calling function, but I'm more interested in how to improve the if check if there is a way.
This replaces sequence of 2 or more whitespaces (possible mixture spaces, tabs, newlines) with a single space, so that the indexOf will match regardless of the number of spaces in the original text.
I have a page that is part of a CMS and I cannot alter any existing HTML or CSS, but I can add additional custom JavaScript and CSS. There is some text on this page I want to hide and I found a solution but it feels kludgey. I can't be sure other pages won't have similar content on them, which is why I'm being so specific in my check.
although you asked for it but in the end you didn't need to handle strings with strange number of spaces like office    is  closed,
