The output will list the runlevels for the named init script, and though every distro is different, you should mostly see "on" next to the runlevel numbers, similar to:
Excuse the long-windedness of my answer, just trying to be thorough. :)  In the order of your question:
If no process is running, and nothing is listening on port 25, yet the packages appear to be installed, check to see if an init script exists for the MTA in question:
If the output shows no sendmail installed, you can do the same for postfix and exim, the other likely MTAs on CentOS:
Finally, the portion I should've started with: assuming the issue isn't an MTA problem, you need to provide more information for anyone to be able to help you.  Yes, you're unable to send mail, but what are the symptoms?  Does PHP give you an error response?  If so, what is it?  If not, have you enabled full debug output?  Do you see anything at all in any server logs?  Etc.
If one doesn't, you'll need to erase the RPM and re-install, as there's no way to know what has and hasn't been messed with if this is a custom installation.  If it does, try starting it:
It seems that the default CentOS 5 MTA is sendmail.  The first concern is why sendmail doesn't appear to be running on your box - did you specifically choose not to install it, or was it not your choice?  Assuming Slicehost didn't remove it, you still need to confirm why/if it isn't running:
The PHP mail() function calls the local sendmail command, which most MTAs replace with wrappers for their own binaries.  Most distros also cleanly install their MTA of choice with default settings to work out of the box.
An MX is a Mail eXchange DNS record - in the context of this discussion it has nothing to do with sending mails.  It is used by other parties trying to send mail to you.  Regarding the spam - that again is not something you would control on your side.  Imagine anyone with access to a *nix box being able to mark their outbound mail as "not spam"...
The output with this should help you diagnose if there are any issues, otherwise it will start with no issue and doing a netstat again or a telnet to port 25 should show it listening.  If there are issues, then I'd suggest you ask for help on this site or speak to Slicehost.  If all is functional, one last thing is to make sure the init script is being loaded on boot:
