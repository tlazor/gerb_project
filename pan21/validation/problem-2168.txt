Hidden deep in the settings is a way by which you can download different libraries to import in your program. Anything, from the conventional numpy and kivy, to the Pi standard RPi.GPIO, to externally developed ones like pigpio (that's what I use on my Pi, because it has a daemon and doesn't get interrupted by the system processes).
You could try gpiozero library instead of RPi.GPIO. It can be installed in your dev environment and tested in Pi.
This Raspberry Pi emulator simulates some of the functions used in the RPi.GPIO library (using python). The intention of this library is educational.
You can get it on the JetBrains website. There's a free (they call it PyCharm Community) version, and a Pro version, both on the JetBrains website. I find the Community version satisfactory.
You can type your code on your PC using PyCharm, upload it, and then pull it on your Pi when you want to run it.
The downside is that it's not the most intuitive software, and it takes a while to find out how exactly you do stuff. But after a while, one finally gets the hang of it.
