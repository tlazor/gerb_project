Hello i have a small database i'm working on and when i import on another server it tells me you have 6 warnings. when i show warnings it says 1031 This table doesn't have this option. I've searched on google about this problem but i didn't find something that relates my problem and the warning level is on note.
These warnings should be safe to disregard, but it is easy enough to just edit the file with a quality text editor (such as Notepad++) and remove CHECKSUM=1 from each place where it appears.  If the warnings go away, that was the issue.  Removing the option should have no negative consequence, since it isn't doing anything anyway.
How the option originally got set is difficult to guess... either these tables were converted from MyISAM to InnoDB at some point, or perhaps you created them with some kind of graphical MySQL client that added the option to be "helpful."
CHECKSUM=1 is not an option that is supported by InnoDB.  When used with MyISAM, it causes the CHECKSUM TABLE command to run faster because the storage engine maintains the calculated checksum whenever the table data is changed, instead of having to calculate it on demand... but otherwise it doesn't actually have a purpose (such as safety, data integrity, or error detection or correction, even though it sounds like it might).
