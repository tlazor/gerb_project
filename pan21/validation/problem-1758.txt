So your first order of business would be to change your falling algorithm to include acceleration, not just velocity. Instead of:
Now, to implement simple jumping (we'll get to your exact question right after this), you simply set velocity_y to a desired value. As long as the sign for acceleration_y and your desired velocity_y are different, your object will jump correctly (In other terms, you don't "turn off gravity". You keep it on, and simply set the object's velocity to some predefined value).
You will notice that the greater velocity_y is when you start jumping, the higher the jump will be. So to implement your desired effect, you add some kind of acceleration to the jump (in physical terms, this means adding a force. Think of adding a small rocket to the object).
Gravity doesn't work like that. Google "uniformly accelerated motion" for the details, but in simple terms, as another fellow member said, gravity is an acceleration, not a velocity.
To do this, you do the same thing as before, but now the acceleration and velocity should have the same sign. You do this while the button is pressed:
To put it simply, while velocity is the constant rate of change of position over time, acceleration is the constant rate of change of velocity over time.
