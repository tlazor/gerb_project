To be more concrete, and to give a potential use case, consider this description of a Sql Injection attack. If my website were under sustained attack from techniques along those lines, and if getting the website patched looked like a lengthy process, it would be tempting (if Sql allowed it) to try to get some provisional relief by putting something in Sql that basically said
I would like to know if you can make Sql Server look at incoming query strings and reject ones that match a certain pattern. In other words, for a certain class of queries (perhaps identified by a regular expression), I want to know if Sql Server could be made to return an error message rather than processing them as it normally would.
My guess is that, if this sort of filtering is possible, then doing it would require writing some kind of custom Sql Server Add-In DLL. But maybe you can do something like this with Sql Server 2008's built-in auditing features? I really have no idea, and I'm not sure where in the documentation would be the best place to start looking.
If you want to point out why the database is a stupid place to try to block sql injection attacks, that's fine. But my primary question is not whether it's a good idea in this particular use case but whether this sort of query filtering/rejection is even possible.
