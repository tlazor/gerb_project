I have, several times, moved a hard disk installation of Ubuntu from one computer to another, and it just worked. It even worked when i moved from an Intel processor to AMD, and, just yesterday, i removed my Nvidia card from one computer and enabled the on-board Intel VGA, and the OS including GUI started just like nothing had happened at all. So unless you have some very special hardware requirements, Ubuntu should just work fine for you.
Personally, i prefer XUbuntu, especially on my (6 year old) laptop, since it has lower hardware requirements, but it doesn't really make a difference if both your computers are quite new.
Since you need some windows Software as well, i'd just recommend installing VirtualBox on your Ubuntu installation, and installing Windows as a VM within Virtualbox. This should take care of all "Hardware A is different from Hardware B" issues nicely. (Last month, i moved a Windows Server 2008 Virtual Machine from an AMD Host running Windows 7 to an Intel Host running Ubuntu, again without Windows reconfiguring anything, so you shouldn't have any problems there either). I'm no expert on the Windows EULA and its enforcability in various jurisdictions, but as this leaves you with one installation that can never be run on more than one computer, you'll probably be fine.
You might have some problems if you're planning to run 3d-intense games within your Windows VM, but everything else should run fine there.
