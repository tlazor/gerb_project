Honestly it's not worth it maybe it's possible to upgrade it but it will cost you as much as getting a fair new laptop instead my advice is try to sell your old laptop for as much as you can get and get a new one no need to buy some super new tech like a core i5 5th or 6th generation with 8gb of ddr3 ram and a nvidia graphic card with 2gb up to 4gb is sufficient to get your work to be done .
Laptops do not have standard hardware like custom PC's do, therefore it's not generally possible to do what you're asking. Your best bet is to purchase a new laptop that is within the requirements of the software you're running.
