I'm a programmer, not a system adminstrator, so please forgive my administrative naivete. My software, written in C#, relies on UDP multicasting. One machine, the server, streams events to an known UDP group address (configurable, but 224.130.103.5 by default), to which all of the clients on the network are subscribed. 
If you have a VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter activated on your system that might be the problem, which it was for me, so try disabling it. See https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/8698.
Usually this works great, but at some of my clients it does not work at all, and often their network administrators are unable to fix the problem. My question is, on a Windows network, what would the common causes be for UDP multicast not working? Is there anything I can tell the network administrators about how to fix it or at least where to look?
Try disabling windows firewall and check if your software is receiving packets. I had similar problems with my Java program. If firewall is the problem start experimenting with firewall rules for your incoming traffic.
