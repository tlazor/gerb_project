To change your current 32-bit OS installation to a 64-bit OS, you need to perform a fresh install, which means you'll (probably) lose all your data stored in the system volume, and you have to re-install most, if not all, softwares.
As you didn't say which OS you're running, which can differ a lot in system requirements. To run a 64-bit Windows system (assume it's not Windows XP 64-bit), you need at least 2 GB RAM and 20 GB hard drive. This is the minimum requirement. From my experience, 4 GB RAM + 64 GB hard drive is recommended. If you're going to change to 64-bit Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, your CPU must support the CMPXCHG16b instruction, which is a common feature supported by all Intel Core 2 or later, or AMD Phenom 64 processors, so if your computer was bought or assembled in the last 10 years, CPU is not something to worry about.
If you're going to run a 64-bit Linux like Ubuntu or Fedora, the requirement is much lower. You can cut the RAM requirement by half, and older CPUs are supported. But don't expect a new OS will run fluently on ancient hardware. It's still recommended that you have 4 GB RAM and 32 GB hard drive for a 64-bit Linux installation.
If you want Windows 10 64-bit for example you would need to have at least 2 GB of RAM 20GB Disk Space, and a processor that supports 64 bit instruction set. If you Google the name of your processor you can probably find a page with information that tells you if it has this or not.
