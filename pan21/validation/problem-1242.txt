I've seen some people claim that uninstalling all of the .NET frameworks completely and then reinstalling them has fixed the problem but that seems a bit extreme for what is only a minor annoyance at worst. Personally, I'm going to give it a day or so to see if Microsoft figures out the problem.
These 3 updates downloaded and apparently installed 4 separate times on Tuesday 05-22-12.  They show up 4 times in Update History but aren't present in Add/Remove Programs.  Possibly MS took care of it by yesterday morning (05-23) because I no longer have them trying to download/install.   One interesting quirk:  yesterday morning the little yellow "update" shield was present when I turned on the computer so I started the update and immediately hit the "Cancel update" button.  Is that what stopped it?  The fixit is a popup at:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910339     I haven't tried it myself, since the problem seems to have ended.  Also, I see in Update History that one of them (KB2633880) was donwloaded on 02-15-12 and also is not shown in add/remove programs.  Go figure.
This appears to be a bug on Microsoft's end. People are experiencing the same problem world wide, with the same patches. KB2518864 was originally released nearly a year ago and has since been superseded by another fix. The other two were originally released earlier this year.
You may need to uninstall .NET Framework 2.0, reboot, reinstall it, reboot, then run Windows Update again.
