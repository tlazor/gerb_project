What I would do is to download the fedora-release RPM from Fedora 14, and apply that. Then you will have files in /etc/yum.repos.d which you will have to manually update their baseurls to point to the appropriate directories on archive.fedoraproject.org (and remove the mirrorlist or metalink that might have been in there). This should get you to the point where you can install software and apply whatever updates were available for F14.
Also keep in mind that after you do this, the vendor is probably going to tell you to get stuffed...if they're even still in business. Which seems doubtful, if they were making silly business decisions like this.
I wouldn't even think about upgrading it past F14 unless you are prepared to sacrifice whatever functionality the vendor provided with this device. Binary compatibility with their custom software cannot be guaranteed if you upgrade to F15 or higher.
You have a very strange situation. It's really quite bizarre that any vendor would base a "network switch" on Fedora; with its very short 13-month lifecycle it would be very difficult to support. Unless, of course, they made it impossible to install or update anything, which they seem to have done. And that opens you up to security holes...
First, the official Fedora archive site is https://archive.fedoraproject.org/. There you will find the old repositories you are looking for.
So if you want to get to a point where you can install software on it, this is what I would recommend.
