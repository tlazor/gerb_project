If you do choose to include those wallpapers, the worst that will happen at first is that you'll receive a cease-and-desist letter kindly asking you to remove the wallpapers or face legal action. If for some very stupid reason you choose to keep them, you will be faced with a lawsuit, and you will lose. Hands down. This question alone is enough evidence to show that you knew you were infringing on some copyrights.
Some quick Googling revealed that Cellfish does way more than just make a few apps and that they were probably hired to make those apps by the copyright holders.
Some companies are very laid back about fan-made content/use of copyrighted material and won't enforce their copyright unless you're doing something really bad that they'd rather not have their work associated with, or if you're profiting from it. Others will send out cease-and-desist letters for just about everything that would be considered infringing.
With those kinds of download numbers, they'd have the pants sued off of them by now were they not properly licensing the copyrighted material.
Short answer, no. That isn't how copyright works. If you use someone else's copyrighted material without an agreement with the copyright holder, you are in violation of their copyright and they can tell you to remove the infringing parts of your work.
As for the example, if you look at the other apps Cellfish has released, you'll see they have a bunch of company logos front and center, and all their apps describe themselves as the "official" app of that kind for that company/IP.
