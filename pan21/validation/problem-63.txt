If you copy the snapshot volume, either as a block device or by copying the files within it, you'll get the complete contents, either way.
All of this comes with a caveat: you can get inside the metadata in the shapshot LV and do "funky" things, like a highly efficient device-level rsync.  I mention this because I've written lvmsync to do exactly this, and it sounds like you might be after this kind of functionality, from the tone of your question.
The 200MB size of the snapshot is the amount of changed data that the snapshot can store, before it bursts its seams and spills blocks of data all over the floor.
An LVM snapshot works by keeping a list of changed blocks, and their contents, in the snapshot volume, while passing all requests to read unchanged data down to the underlying block device.  All of this intelligence is built into LVM, in the kernel, and mount has no knowledge of it.  As far as anything in userspace is concerned, there are two block devices available, both of which are the same size (1G, in your example).  The fact that one's an LVM origin volume and the other is a snapshot is of no concern to anyone except the bits of the dm (device mapper) system that have to deal with that.
