Your code looks nice and seems to be fully PEP 8 compliant indeed. The fact that you have 1 blank line between functions except in one place where you have 2 puzzles me a bit but that's not a huge issue.
Be consistent with your parameter names.  step_size is more descriptive than step, so use it for all of the functions.  step_number sounds like the nth step to me, and would be slightly better named steps.
Extracting repeated code will ensure that, if a bug exists in the common code, you won't have to remember to fix it in all the locations. It can also lead to a smaller overall code size. With this code the benefit is minimal, but as code gets more complex it will help a lot.
Instead of creating a dictionary and randomly indexing a specific value, you can use random.choice(). It will do the work to select a random element.
All of the go_* functions are implemented with the same code. The only difference is the value passed to setheading(). You could create one common implementation and replace them with calls to that function.
Running the code with the exact same parameters may yield completely different results because pseudo-random numbers are used.
I've changed the terminology from right/left to east/west, since the former could be misinterpreted as a relative turn rather than an absolute heading.  In any case, the designations are entirely optional.
You can actually make your code much easier. Here are a individual steps, you'll find the final code at the end.
The rules are easy, an object is moved in the direction dictated by random or pseudo-random numbers.
