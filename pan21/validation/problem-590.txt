Since the field you are querying on is a prefix of the compound index, it is also a candidate evaluated by the query planner.
In this case both of your plans do the same amount of work so there is no deterministic winner. In fact,  your single key index is a prefix of the compound index so the compound index can answer all of the same queries. You should drop the single index rather than having both.
The estimated execution time in this explain output is only informational. The execution estimate is not factored into the works scores since it will change frequently based on other concurrent activity. If you run the same explain multiple times the estimates are likely to be 0 once all the relevant indexes and documents are loaded into memory.
When evaluating candidate query plans MongoDB determines which query plan returns the first batch of results (by default 101 documents) with the least amount of overall work (indicated by the works score).  The works score is a proxy for different effort involved in query stages (index key comparisons, fetching documents, etc). If multiple plans perform identical work during evaluation, there are some small tie-breaking bonuses that can help choose a plan to cache (for example, if a plan is a covered query or does not require an in-memory sort).
