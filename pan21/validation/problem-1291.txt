Use your openwrt router with SQM enabled (preferably cake and not openwrt but LEDE) for your lag-sensitive devices . Then connect a cheapo TP-LINK (stock firmware) from it's wan port into the lan port of your openwrt/LEDE router  and enable the feature: restrict bandwidth on tplink.
This is not the best solution, maybe your could try Pf-sense /IPFIRE qos /sqm to split the bandwidth and stuff but you need an extra PC for that .
I hope you already fixed it somehow by now. But if you haven't or someone else needs help with this the solution I came up with is the following :
Set it at half your total speed and fire up multiple instances of YouTube Netflix torrent etc on your tplink routers network Then open your lag-sensitive programs on your main network (openwrt/LEDE) and measure lag. If too high lower the limit (mainly upload) on your TPLINK if too low push it up until it affects your ping and so on, you need to find the right balance.
As a side note you wont be able to access your tplinks router page from openwrt so you may want to go into remote configuration and set it to 255.255 255 255 and set wan address to static so that it can be accessed from your openwrt/LEDE box.
