You may need other configuration as well to get this working depending on the environment, but this is required in any case, and this and the rest may just work if everything is set up conveniently (e.g. the KDCs are discoverable via the DNS, the web server principal name is determined properly from its DNS name with the default rules, etc.). If not, I can help you figure out what else needs to be done.
Do you mean by this that users log into OS X using their AD username and password? If so, they may already have Kerberos credentials once they’re logged in. To check this, use the klist command from a terminal prompt; you should see something like:
If not, use kinit user@REALM from a command prompt to authenticate. The REALM will be the AD domain name. When it was based on MIT Kerberos, Apple’s Kerberos implementation would automatically bring up a GUI panel when a program needed Kerberos and the user was not authenticated; unfortunately when they switched to Heimdal they dropped this nice feature, and now you have to do it manually.
