Perhaps it is possible to download the file in sections?  Although I do not know if I can conveniently split my file into multiple files -- I think this would be very difficult, since the file is binary and is not human-readable.
As it is now, if the entire ~35 GB file download doesn't finish before the break in the connection, then I have to start the download over and overwrite the ~5-20 GB chunk that was downloaded locally so far.
Although my broadband internet connection is quite good, my download of the large file often fails with a Connection Lost error message.  I am not sure, but I think that it fails because perhaps my internet connection goes out for a second or two every several hours.  Since the file is so large, downloading it may take 4.5 to 5 hours, and perhaps the internet connection goes out for a second or two during that long time.  I think this because I have successfully downloaded files of this size using the same internet connection and the same SSH software on the same computer. In other words, sometimes I get lucky and the download finishes before the internet connection drops for a second.  
I have a ~35 GB file on a remote Linux Ubuntu server.  Locally, I am running Windows XP, so I am connecting to the remote Linux server using SSH (specifically, I am using a Windows program called SSH Secure Shell Client version 3.3.2).
Is there any way that I can download the file in an intelligent way -- whereby the operating system or software "knows" where it left off and can resume from the last point if a break in the internet connection occurs?
