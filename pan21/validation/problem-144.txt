One user at my site has reported that he reaches the content at /var/www when browsing to any of the vhosts at my server. As far as I’m aware, my Apache server does not contain a document root that references this folder. On top of that, this user seems to be the only one experiencing the issue. According to his ISP, the issue isn’t caused by them, yet, on his mobile connection, he can access the site. When browsing to my server’s IP, he also receives the correct content from the default vhost.
Look carefully at all request headers that come from client. It may be some headers sent by his provider's proxy server.
Not exactly same issue but there was a client which has gained access to the admin panel of something just by using a proxy server. His  proxy sent the X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.something header which was taken as the real IP address by server software. And it turned out that admin access was only restricted by local IP address.
What could be the possible causes of this issue and how can I get it to stop? I’ve explored pretty much every option I could think of.
I'd be curious if the user is using a browser that isn't using HTTP/1.1, but rather HTTP/1.0 requests that don't pass the hostname with the request.  It sounds as if there's no identifying site information to trigger your web server to serve up the right page, so it's landing on the default web root.  Perhaps you could encourage him to attempt a different browser as a troubleshooting step.
Did you switch DNS recently? It sounds like the ISP are mistaken, and are in fact caching an old DNS entry. I've run into this a couple of times in the past. Only after the ISP flushed things on their end was the problem resolved.
If you want to test that theory, you could get his IP and search the logs for it to see what he's sending.  If there's any question as to whether he is accessing your site or another, you could attempt to put up a file in /var/www and direct him to that file as a test.  Alternatively, you could configure your default webroot to point to a site you host that makes the most sense.
