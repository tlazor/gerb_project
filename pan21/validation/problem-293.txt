Also when there is too few ram memory, old computers lose lot of speed and because of swp file and not that stable and complex OS's like today - it can appear to be hanged, it's helpfull to user to tell him that computer is working on some data and be ready soon.
These days, Windows is more stable and multi-task scheduling tends to work better, so there are probably fewer cases where it is useful.
Well, I can say, as an engineer for MiniScribe (later Maxtor), it's exactly what it appears to be. It's an "activity" light. It was a way for us to tell that a command had been received through the interface and was underway. It was a debugging tool for those of us who, you know, built disk drives.
Even so, the light is still of use to determine if the system is loading data from disk or is completely hung. A computer in normal operation will have intermittent disk accesses; if the system stops responding and there is no disk activity whatsoever for several minutes, chances are very good it needs to be forcibly rebooted. In fact, on my custom-built desktop, there is a disk activity light on the motherboard itself so one could see if the disk(s) are busy (assuming a windowed case) even if the PC is on a table and the case's own disk activity light isn't as readily visible.
Long hard drive operations usually occures when user is waiting for something, for example loading game - when a screen can be black. I think this is some indicator, that have to tell user, that computer doesn't hang up, and some task will be completed after a while.
Sometimes it's useful to know if the hard drive is active. For example, if the machine isn't responding in any way, but the hard drive is active, it may be that the system is overloaded and swapping physical memory to swap, but hasn't actually crashed. If this is the case, it may be best to wait for the slow operation to finish, rather than rebooting the machine.
The disk activity light looks like a cylinder because early hard disk drives for mainframes consisted of large cylinders of platters and corresponding sets of read/write heads. The disk stacks themselves on those drives were designed to be physically interchangeable. Shown here is an IBM 350 disk unit used with the IBM 305 RAMAC computer, which dates back to the 1950s.
This still holds true for modern PCs that are configured to boot and run applications from a electromechanical hard drive, but with the increasingly widespread use of solid-state drives which can access data in a matter of microseconds rather than milliseconds, the amount of time the system spends waiting for disk is far less, and the disk activity light is of less value on systems with SSDs. In fact, many newer PCs, especially thin-and-light laptops, omit the light altogether. A more comprehensive way to monitor disk activity is to use Task Manager, which as of Windows 8 can show disk activity.
The main purpose of the light is to allow the user to determine if the system is busy due to disk activity. Before the advent of solid-state drives, long load times for the OS and applications were the norm, and while one could hear the hard disk seeking, the light was a much more reliable indicator of disk activity since sequential I/O is not noticeably noisier than disk idle. If the system seemed stuck but the disk activity light was on, chances were good that the system was just waiting for the disk rather than actually hung.
