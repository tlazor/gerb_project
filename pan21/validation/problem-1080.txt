Multiclass classification means a classification task with more than two classes; e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples, or pears. Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at the same time.
Multilabel classification assigns to each sample a set of target labels. This can be thought as predicting properties of a data-point that are not mutually exclusive, such as topics that are relevant for a document. A text might be about any of religion, politics, finance or education at the same time or none of these.
Multioutput-multiclass (or multilabel-multiclass) classification means that a single estimator has to handle several joint classification tasks. This is both a generalization of the multi-label classification task, which only considers binary classification, as well as a generalization of the multi-class classification task. The output format is a 2d numpy array or sparse matrix.
As each object of your data can be classified in one to multiple labels at the same time, it is a simple multilabel classification problem
