In particular, Wikipedia's Zeroconf article, UPnP article, and the O'Reilly Zeroconf-vs-UPnP article (from chills42's comment) are the best references for comparing the two and getting a feel for how they differ.
UPnP is a separate architechure, considered a competitor in some ways and an altogether different technology in others.  It supports a form of zero-configuration networking but doesn't use the mDNS/DNS-SD protocols that Apple utilizes.  UPnP provides a service discovery protocol called Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) that is a rough equivalent to DNS-SD.
The equivalent for Bonjour in Windows is Universal Plug and Play. It has been part of Windows sinds XP.
Bonjour is an implementation of Zeroconf (Zero Configuration Networking), which consists of the protocols mDNS (Multicast DNS) and DNS-SD (DNS-Service Discovery).  mDNS provides "link-local addressing", while DNS-SD is a means for devices to discover services provided by other devices on the network.
While there is a Windows version of Bonjour, Microsoft does have its own implementation of zero-configuration networking that isn't exactly the same.
Bonjour!  It runs on Windows too.  Here's a link to the wikipedia entry, you can read more starting there.
