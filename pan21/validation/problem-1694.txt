I want to know how a web server can distinguish between requests of different DNS names on the same server (same IP)?
Basically the PAYLOAD (not tcp, the http request structure) tells the web serve rwhat the domiain is for.
and when I use nslookup on Windows, I got the same IP address for both domain names. Can you explain please?
(note the empty line at the end if you want to re-create this yourself by using, say, telnet. You can see a lot of this stuff also over in wikipedia)
Without this feature, a different IP address would be needed for each different site; we would have run out of IPv4 space even sooner if we didn't have this in place.
Fire up your favourite packet tracer (something like wireshark) and watch what actually happens when you connect.
HTTP 1.1 requires that all client systems send a header, Host, which indicates to the server which hostname they are sending the request for.
There's a lot of stuff shown in these headers, so you might want to get to know them with a browser plugin like Firebug
