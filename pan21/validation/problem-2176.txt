Now, given what you described, not all of the above applies to you.. In a properly configured system, most outgoing connections should indeed find any available interface to be able to send network traffic on, and as routers and switches become more sophisticated, automatic translation of addresses happens without you needing to any additional hardware/software. But there are still other issues to contend with; One of them is interface metric (priority), which is what it sounds like was your original problem.
Great question btw!   I have had a similar situation happen to me back when I was working for Intel, but I do not remember the interfaces not automatically switching over when one of them was disconnected.   
I thought that TCP/IP would simply use the network interface which is available if the other is not?
Another possible issue/cause of your exact symptoms may be in the routing tables. Generally speaking, when the TCP/IP stack tries to route a data packet, it looks up the destination address in the routing table. If it finds an exact match, it sends to pack out the assigned interface. If it doesn't find an exact match, but finds close/masked match, it will send the packet to that assigned interface. If it finds no match at all, it will send the packet to whatever is the "default gateway" to let the gateway decide how to route the packet.
So, why mightn't this have happened for you..?  I thought one reason might be a Thunderbolt transceiver dongle not reporting a carrier drop to the kernel, but in your screen capture, it seems like the system is aware there is no Ethernet connection.
I just tested failover with my Mac mini.  I have two network interfaces configured, Ethernet and WiFi.  Both were in good standing as the test commenced, with the Ethernet having precedence in service order.
Well, it didn’t last night - when I went to bed, my wife asked about an ethernet cable I had run through the kitchen, and thinking that the wireless connection would handle the traffic if the ethernet was removed, I told her just to remove the ethernet cable, retract the line out of the kitchen, shut the door, and go to bed, as I rolled over...  :-D
This leads me to a more general question:  How do I divide the network traffic up to take advantage of both network interfaces, thus increasing my throughput?
Again, how you configure the system would affect how it responds when the link assigned to the default gateway suddenly goes down. But that brings us back to configuration--Your computer would need to know that if the default gateway become inaccessible, it should switch to the default gateway of the other iface. It sounds like that's what it eventually did once you change the priority of the NICs, which is why it started working again.
If there are two network connections attached to my MacBook Pro, and I remove one, shouldn’t the networking just use the other?
I'm not very familiar with Macintosh computers, but I am with Ethernet and TCP/IP networking. Other than using some kind of aggregation/link sharing/splitting scheme, the answer to your "why didn't it use the other link" question is.. it depends on what interface(s) the applications in question are bound to, if they can find another route, and so on.
Since your WiFi adapter and your Ethernet adapter are two totally separate interfaces, you cannot simply join the two together and get increased throughput.   This is also due to the fact that the theoretical link speed of Wireless (varies depending on technology used) and Ethernet (10/100/1000) are quite different.   According to Wikipedia
In summary:  On Mac OS X, Version 10.9.2, running on a Mid-2011 Mac Mini, failover works as expected.
However, there can only be one default gateway! This is because the computer (well, your computer's TCP/IP stack) is unable to determine where to send the packet, so it needs to send it to the gateway to make that determination. However, if you had two default gateways--your computer would not know which one to send it to, since it's not able to determine where to send the packet in the first place! Your computer would have a nervous breakdown trying to decide, and eventually divide by zero, which we know would not be good..
Without being told that it can use the other interface, your computer only tried the first interface in your list. For all it knows, the second interface could be linked to a nuclear launch facility and any data will start WW3.. Not a good idea, even if extreme :-P Anyhow, the point is, without you configuring it to do so, your computer does not have a real brain to figure out the other connection will work just as well as the first. That's why it started working after you properly configured it to "failover".
With the above in mind, it should start to make sense why you lost "connectivity".. Your wired connection has one MAC address which is mapped to one IP address, and your wireless has a different, unique MAC/IP address pair. Between your computer and your router, these pairs of MAC/IP are used to identify where any network data should be sent.. BUT.. if one link fails, neither your computer nor your router has an easily feasible way to suddenly "change" the source/destination address pairs after the fact.
Again, as computers and OSes become more sophisticated, more and more of them DO come out of the box pre-configured to do this sort of thing automatically these days.. but understanding the underlying issues and configurations will help you understand and correct problems when they do occur. Likewise, I'm not entirely sure on how Macintosh computers are set up to handle thee situations, but I understand the newer un*x-based ones of the past few years generally have solid iface up/down handling and logic.
Sorry if this all is clear as mud! But to help you diagnose these kind of issues, learn how to use some of the network diagnostic tools such as 'arp' (tells you what MAC is bound/mapped to an IP address, or vice versa) and 'route' (will tell you how it'll try to route packets based on destination address).
Think of it like the post office. Someone writes you a letter, and they put your name and address on the envelope. What if you moved? Without doing anything to redirect your mail, it would still get delivered to your old address and you'd never see it. Of course, as I said, you could have it redirected/forwarded, and that's what some aggregation schemes do--but they require additional hardware or software to do it, just like the post office needs additional workers/machines to sort and redirect your mail. It's not something that just happens on it's own.
So, I opened Network in System Preferences, and changed the order so that Wi-Fi came first, not second, as in:
I repeated the test a few times, looking at different network indicators.  Failover to WiFi happened as one would expect.  One ping packet dropped on disconnect; none dropped on reconnect.
Many applications also "bind" to a specific network interface--Without a binding, it would be like telling a stranger to "call me tomorrow" without giving them the number to call. They'd have no way to know how to contact you. Likewise, your mail client needs to tell the mail server what IP address to send any data back to you. It usually happens transparently because the source and destination addresses are embedded in the packet headers.
This morning, Mac Mail, and other tools (Safari) couldn’t get to the Internet, even though there was a wireless connection to my WiFi router.  So, I naively restarted both Mail and Safari, and they still couldn’t see the Internet.
Now, if you had two Ethernet interfaces (as opposed to Ethernet and WiFi), you could use a technology known as Link Aggregation to 'bond' two similar interfaces to make your computer think it was a single Ethernet connection.   The network protocol that provides this functionality is called LACP (link aggregation control protocol).   Unfortunately, in order to do Link Aggregation, not only does the dual NIC need to support this functionality, but the gear you are connecting to also needs to support LACP and have all of its settings be the same as on the client side.   This feature is common on high end routers and switches, but most consumer grade gear does not support this.
