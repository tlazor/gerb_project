Thing is that my mouse device is a Razer Abyssus, and it comes with a very slow move configuration when you plug it to a Linux distro.
That last command should say something along the lines of xinput is already the newest version (1.6.2-xxx). if it was previously properly installed.
Sorry if I'm not explaining myself very well. English not my talent. But I really hope someone can help me because the default options are so slow that it gets uncomfortable to work with this mouse.
If you still can't run the command after doing all of that, your system might be broken beyond repair, but I highly doubt you won't be able to. We'll troubleshoot if that happens.
I installed Xinput but it doesn't work the same. Can't find the right options to make that alias work as before.
I installed Debian 10 Buster and can't find the way to control my mouse options from Xinput like I do on Ubuntu 18 or Debian 9.
Then you haven't installed xinput, or you haven't installed it properly. There is no other way you'd get this error if you had. 
You will need to run these commands as root, either run su then these commands, or put sudo in front of the commands - depending on your system.
