I have octave, r-base, and maxima packages installed on my Rpi0 running on a Kali Linux. For a reference, I have a screen snapshot of their executions on a CLI as shown below.
On most Linux distributions (including ARM platforms), there are more than a handful of free and open-source Scientific Programming Language software packages, i.e. GNU Octave (similar and/or not 100% compatible to MATLAB), R Project (for Statistical Computing), Maxima (Computer Algebra System with symbolic and numerical expressions), etc. They should be available on a raspbian Linux distro as octave, r-base, and maxima packages, respectively. If you are more familiar with MATLAB, then I strongly recommend that you install GNU Octave package and give it a try. As I said before, GNU Octave is NOT 100% compatible to MATLAB. However, most MATLAB basic codes should run out of the box on GNU Octave. For a statistician, I believe R Project is more suitable. For those who are familiar with Mathematica, the maxima package may be a good substitute. If you are a hardcore C++ programmer, perhaps this SymbolicC++ may interest you.
