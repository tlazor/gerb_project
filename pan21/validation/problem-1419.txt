After running ssh-keygen on the new box (lets call it Server A), and copying the public key over to Server B, I try to SSH from A into B. I ran into some permissions issues, so made a couple of chmod's (tried changing id_rsa.pub to 0600 from 644, and then later chmod'd the .ssh dir to 0600).
As background information, I was able to successfully ssh (with rsync -e "ssh -i...") last night from Server A into Server B. No changes were made between 7 hours ago then and when I began to have problems this morning.
