a) I can't even remeber a time when my hosts file didn't have more than just a 127.0.0.1 localhost entry and that if it even had that when "out of the box"
No. Starting in Windows 7 the localhost entry has been removed. localhost is now resolved in the DNS resolver itself. The file itself is there, but out-of-box it's just a bunch of comments.
That said; Windows 7 behaves like there is a localhost entry in the HOSTS file. localhost does point to 127.0.0.1 and ::1, just with different means.
It's always been %WINDIR%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts for NT based Windows. Some versions of Windows, like 2000; use \WINNT instead of \Windows. And as I stated above; Windows 7 doesn't use the HOSTS file at all to resolve localhost.
b) Have all versions of post Windows 3.1 always used a host file for local DNS queires and is it always located in :\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts ?
As I'm always creating mini test and developmet sites I'm writing a mini-web based script in php 5.3 to ease the creation of local dev sites on windows running a wamp stack which is intended to create a vhost entry and also an entry for the site in the Windows host file and thought I might as well make it as non-windows version specific as possible. It occured to me that:-
I know it sounds a bit lazy to save myself manually doing a couple of easy edits in apache conf and the host file, but I am planning to add a few extra bits to it (creation of a mysql/sqllite/mssql/postgre template database, ability to build a zend framework template etc, so it's not just the vhost and host file entries! I'll also be creating a parallel set-up script to hopefully ease deployment on my Unix vps as well, but that should be a little easier)
