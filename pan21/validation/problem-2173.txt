Thus, precision will be more important than recall when the cost of acting is high, but the cost of not acting is low. Note that this is the costs of acting/not acting per candidate, not "cost of having any action at all" versus "cost of not having any action at all". In the apple example, it's the cost of buying/not buying a particular apple, not the cost of buying some apples versus the cost of not buying any apples; the cost of not buying a particular apple is low because there are lots of other apples. Since the cost of buying a bad apple is high, but the cost of passing up a particular good apple is low, precision is more important in that example. Another examples would be hiring when there's a lot of similar candidates.
Can anyone give me some examples where precision is important and some examples where recall is important ?
Precision tends to involve direct costs; the more false positives you have, the more cost per true positive you have. If your costs are low, then precision doesn't matter as much. For instance, if you have 1M email addresses, and it will cost $10 to send an email to all of them, it's probably not worth your time to try to identify the people most likely to respond, rather just spamming all of them.
We have thousands of free customers registering in our website every week. The call center team wants to call them all, but it is imposible, so they ask me to select those with good chances to be a buyer (with high temperature is how we refer to them). We don't care to call a guy that is not going to buy (so precision is not important) but for us is very important that all of them with high temperature are always in my selection, so they don't go without buying. That means that my model needs to have a high recall, no matter if the precision goes to hell.
Recall, on the other had, tends to involve opportunity costs; you are giving up opportunities every time you have a false negative. So recall is least important when the marginal value of additional correct identification is small, e.g. there are multiple opportunities, there is little different between them, and only a limited number can be pursued. For instance, suppose you want to buy an apple. There are 100 apples at the store, and 10 of them are bad. If you have a method of distinguishing bad apples that misses 80% of good ones, then you will identify about 18 good apples. Normally, a recall of 20% would be terrible, but if you only want 5 apples, then missing those other 72 apples doesn't really matter.
-There are significant differences between opportunities (if some apples are better than others, then a recall rate of 20% is enough to get 5 good apples, but they aren't necessarily going to be the best apples)
-The number of opportunities is small (if there were only 10 good apples, then you would be unlikely to find 5 good ones with a recall rate of only 20%)
-The marginal benefit of opportunities remains high, even for a large number of opportunities. For instance, while most shoppers won't have much benefit from more than 18 good apples, the store would like to have more than 18 apples to sell.
Recall is more important than precision when the cost of acting is low, but the opportunity cost of passing up on a candidate is high. There's the spam example I gave earlier (the cost of missing out on an email address isn't high, but the cost of sending out an email to someone who doesn't respond is even lower), and another example would be identifying candidates for the flu shot: give the flu shot to someone who doesn't need it, and it costs a few dollars, don't give it to someone who does need it, and they could die. Because of this, health care plans will generally offer the flu shot to everyone, disregarding precision entirely.
