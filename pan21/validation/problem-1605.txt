I've got a few Python based servers that I need to run, and would like them to start automatically when I start my Ubuntu Server box. What is the best way to execute them like this?
The Ubuntu (and Debian) way to get applications to start at boot time is to turn them into system services using update-rc.d -- see here for instructions: http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-manage-services-with-update-rc.d
Its failing because sudo is prompting for a password.  Since there's no TTY open, its just waiting for you to enter one--or may, in fact, be instantly failing.  If you're running this as root, you don't need to launch it as sudo.
However, what you likely want to do is alter tornadoDeploy.py to daemonize itself--that is, to detach itself, so that its not running with an open session.  The python-daemonize library provides easy tools to allow you to do this.  This eliminates having to deal with screen, while still allowing you to daemonize the process.
doesn't, with no error messages. Is that something to do with the spaces? Even though I did surround it with backquotes? I also tried:
Remember that anything that runs as root is a potential security vulnerability, especially if other users can modify it.
Read this about startup scripts and this about a python daemon library. Also, don't you have to run tornado behind a real http server?
Assuming your script is a well behaved daemon and that you have set up sudo to not require a password for running your script. 
I was hoping I could write a Bash script and use Screen to get them running in the background, where I can check on them every now and then, but where as
