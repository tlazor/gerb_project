Web space is cheap these days - $5/month will get you decent space on a site like Dreamhost, and $20/month will get you a virtual private server on a host like Slicehost. Are you sure you want to host it from home?
Is this website going to serve more than a couple users? If so, it's going to quickly get slow. Most ADSL connections I've encountered have an upload cap of ~30-50 kb/sec. A site serving content at 30 kb/sec these days feels a bit slow, and that's if there aren't any other users hitting it at the same time. Get a couple simultaneous users and suddenly you could be serving content out at dial-up speeds - and that's if you're not using your connection for anything else!
It'd be easier and more reliable to just call your ISP and ask them to give you a static IP address.  The change should be reasonably quick (a few hours at most, mostly waiting for them to get to it).  It shouldn't involve any noticeable downtime, and should only cost an extra $1 per month or so.
Even the smaller professional hosting companies are moving to well-connected, high-performance virtual/cloud hosting provided by big players like amazon and google and rackspace instead.  Trying to get by on ADSL is at best an interesting experiment.  Not that you should rule it out if the monetary savings are an important factor for you, of course.
Oh and already stated, your ISP may not allow incomming port 80 requests. I know mine does AT&T, but they do not allow me to host POP3 or SMTP.
Your ADSL would be slow for this, though.  Getting decent performance on websites is important, and difficult to achieve at the best of times, without the huge delays of going over ADSL.  If your "customer" connected through ADSL and your site is ALSO on ADSL, then they whole roundtrip for communication will go over ADSL FOUR times -- over their ADSL out, over yours in, over yours out, and over theirs in again!
First, you should install DynDNS client if your router does not support it. Second, you need to forward port 80 to the server machine.
Depending on your router you may not have the right options in it. But you will need to look for either port forwording, upnp settings, or Virtual Server settings. These will allow you to point port 80 at your "server." If all else fails you could set that port on your router up for DMZ, but this is NOT the correct way to do it. Thats only the correct way to open your computer and network up for trouble. 
You should not be able to link to your router from the Internet ("the outside") as this would be a security hole. Do you really need to configure it from outside? I doubt it. If you do, you should be able to set this in the router preferences.
