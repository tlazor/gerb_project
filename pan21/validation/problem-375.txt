The OCZ drives have a built-in garbage collection which does much the same thing as TRIM, which makes it possible to use on Windows XP.
In this article from AnandTech (July 22, 2009) I find different information : "Intel X25-M G2: Dissected and Performance Preview". It contains many benchmarks, on all of which Intel wins hands down, and concludes by:
If there are issues with write speed, I haven't noticed them.  That may be because the issues are too minor to notice or because I don't actually do a lot of sequential writes.  As I said before, I'm running Windows 7 (Enterprise x64).  I'm also running Visual Studio 2008.
I just got the OCZ Agility Series 60 GB SSD with Windows XP - my random read time went from 25 ms to .2 ms.  It is currently around $125 after rebate, and it appears that everything on my lenovo T60 (just 2 gig RAM) is snappy, despite the fact that it is loaded down with Corporate software.  It even makes eclipse run well with large projects.
I can't imaging you'll be disappointed with either choice.  SSDs on developer machines are a good choice no matter how you slice it.
This is purely anecdotal experience.  I've been using the Intel 80GB Gen2 drive with Win7 in my Dell XPS M1730 for about a month now and it absolutely flies.  The M1730 can actually take two internal disk drives, so I just switched the older/larger 7200rpm drive to be the secondary.
