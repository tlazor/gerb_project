The jobs are stored in the system database MSDB. Did you back that up? You need to restore it to get your jobs back.
When reinstating the jobs, make sure to not only look for what jobs you did have in place, but but jobs you should have had in place.
This isn't strictly speaking a direct answer to the question, but I think it's relevant. Virtually any scheduled job that you'd normally create within SQL Server can be done as a batch file using osql or sqlcmd. You can run the batch file from the Windows Task Scheduler.
Now that it's a few weeks later and you've (hopefully) recovered most of your critical jobs, you should revisit what you have in place and think about:
(Of course these are things one should check on all DB servers, but following up on a failure is a great time to re-examine best practices and see what you may be missing.)
It can be difficult to recover in a situation like this, but it's much better if you make sure that you get the jobs back in a situation where you won't have performance issues down the road that bring up problems in the recovery again! 
Which approach is better is a matter of taste. I like using batch files from Windows because I can run other stuff from the batch file, and the batch file is easy to replicate on new installations without worrying about restoring msdb.
For the situation you are in, as pointed out if you have neither an MSDB backup or a saved scripting of the jobs and MSDB is not available, you will have to recreate the jobs from memory or other sources. ("Am I screwed" = Yes)
