Is this running on a web server? If so, make sure the host and containers are really locked down. If it's on a public facing website, make doubly sure (it sounds like you know to do this, but thought I'd mention it)
If it's not running as root, try using unprivileged containers (this might actually be better from a security standpoint). You could then copy the file directly to the container without needing root. Stephane Graber (one of the lxc developers for ubuntu) has a great intro on his blog: Introduction to Unprivileged LXC Containers
I know how to do most of the stuff outlined above, but for the life of me I can't find out how to copy files from the host to the container or the other way around. Every tutorial I see demonstrates behavior by running ls or echo inside the container, but never importing a script or program from the host system. Can anyone help me, or possibly refer me to documentation that can tell me how to accomplish this?
Rootfs is the raw filesystem for the container. You would then execute your script by doing something like:
Now, say I have a C program which takes an int i as argument, and returns that i+1. I want to write a script that copies the C program (let's say plusone.out), together with a list of test inputs (input.txt) to an LxC container, executes the program inside the container, writes the outputs to a file (output.txt), and exports that file back to the host system so the main application (that runs outside the container) can check the results. There also need to be some restrictions on the resources, but I can do that with LxC's inbuilt cgroups implementation.
I'm working on a project that automatically compiles, executes and tests the output of submitted programs in C, C++, Java and Python. Obviously this needs to happen inside some sort of secured environments since any kind of code can be submitted. After trying to create the container myself with a chroot jail, which ended up not being practical, I turned to containers.
