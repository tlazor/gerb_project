It will give you control and options and allow you to experiment with learning new distros when you want. It will also make remote control of the servers a lot easier and reduce hardware incompatibility.
Currently I have an older twin 1.4 GHz workstation running Smoothwall and I'm fairly happy with it, but it needs more tools for pinpointing bandwidth hogs and has little support for other servers. I did just buy a Poweredge 2850 so I was hoping to combine my other servers(MySql, FTP, SSH, etc) into one.
In my experience, all in one distributions tend to all break as one, your badly configured game server will get your DB compromised and your DB won't want to run on the same platform as your file server, and firewall/vpn servers tend to fight with local services. Break them apart and your life gets easier.
Background on me, I am an "at home" admin for 5 college students. So I need low ping (online gaming), high connection load (torrents) and high throughput.
Check out Untangle. It performs well and has some nice reporting features that should do what you want. You can also login to the system as root and install any other servers that you need.
You can then run a smoothwall/pfsense VM to drive the net connection while running an Ubuntu VM for a games server and a Windows XP VM for remote administration/work. 
The reason you're not satisfied with Smoothwall is that it's not a complete Linux distribution, it has a specific function and purpose and is locked down for them.  Basically any major Linux distribution with package management and a large selection of available software will be adequate.  Here are a few that come to mind:
Consider loading up VMware ESXi (it's free), Xen or similar onto the server and adding in virtual machines for different services.
