To know what is the swap and how the virtual memory works... I'd recommend you to take a look to some Operating System lectures, maybe the MIT Open Courseware could be of help.
If you don't want to use swap, then don't use a swap partition (comment out the line in /etc/fstab), but that will prevent to start new process and will make malloc fail if you run out of physical memory. That's not a good idea in general... not very safe and not even very useful, as the OS will keep the hot pages in memory and will swap to disk those that are not being used recently.
I have a laptop with 768Mb of RAM that does not use swap memory. It is good enough for my needs. I have a server with 256Mb of RAM and does not use swap memory. It is running 8 virtual servers using OpenVZ virtualisation, without problems either.
Another solution could be to hack your the database so it locks the pages into memory (I know that can be done, but I couldn't tell you now exactly how), but anyway, it's likey that your database will use it's own swapping and caching mechanisms.
If you do not want your processes to use swap-memory, just disable swap memory altogether. Unfortunately, if you ever run out of memory, the Linux kernel will kill some of your running processes in order to free up some memory for use. 
Swap is hard disk space used as RAM. It is (relatively speaking) very slow, but stops computers from crashing when they are trying to deal with more data then their RAM can handle.
