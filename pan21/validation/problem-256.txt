For extreme reliability, you want to look at multiple power feeds into multiple racks, in multiple globally diverse datacenter locations, each rack having all of the above redundancy built in.
Ok, so you have a server.. And you want pretty good availability and redundancy, so you connect it with one NIC to a single switch.
You can also do lots to make your application layer reliable.  Multiple servers on multiple switches, connected to multiple routers.
Better redundancy would be to connect 2 NICs to the same switch, using STP Bridging to make sure you don't get a loop in the network.
Some of your servers might need to run something such as memcached, to allow you to share session information and allow your users to seamlessly transition between servers.
In a datacentre, this is probably best done by getting some IP space, and announcing it via BGP to your upstream transit/peering providers.
Better still would be to connect 2 NICs to different switches.  Now you can lose a single NIC and a single switch.
This allows one NIC to fail, still leaving you with connectivity. (Depending on the bonding mode of the NIC)
For greater redundancy you need to look at how the network gets beyond the LAN.  WAN redundancy provided by more than one diverse route.  By diverse I mean the traffic takes a different route entirely out to the internet. (say, ADSL vs Cable in an office)
(as well as making sure that your servers have dual power supplies and at least 2 disks in a RAID level >= 1 !)
