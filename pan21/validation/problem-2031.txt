Spam is still a problem, and many viruses create spambots and enslave their infected computers as spam relays. But you're not going to catch a virus from the average spam message.
If you open the email in a web client (ie, online at gmail.com or mail.yahoo.com, etc), you're generally very unlikely to experience any problems. If this email contained a script virus (very rare nowadays) it would generally require being opened in an email client locally installed on the computer in order to gain sufficient access to actually infect your computer.
Gmail blocks images from unknown senders by default. We also scan for viruses and other suspicious content. If you're concerned about a suspicious message, don't display the images when you open it or download any attachments. You can also report the message to Gmail either for spam or for phishing.
Viruses, because of the popularity of web clients for email, have pretty much stopped sending themselves as emails in the last few years.
If you are using a local email client, don't open suspicious emails unless you've got the email client running inside a virtualized system that you can scrub easily with a reset.
Even if you have taken measures to not having your computer infected, there's a high possibility that you will confirm your email address by clicking on the link, regardless of where or how you open it (the link contains a specific code connnected to your address). This will cause them to specifically target your email address in the future.
