Try downloading MSI Kombuster. It is a GPU stress testing tool, and has several stress testing options, from shadows to VRAM load testing. I would suggest downloading that and giving it a run to see if (specifically the VRAM test) causes any corruption issues. Through a bit of research, I can see that the CPU onboard is an AMD E-350, with an integrated Radeon HD 6310 GPU. Some further research on the GPU shows that the 'VRAM' for the GPU is shared memory - which means it will be using inbuilt system RAM for most (pretty much all) of it's memory. I would also suggest booting into the BIOS and having a poke around to see if you can find anything related to the shared memory available. If you find that it's at something like 32mb, try increasing it up to at least 512mb (if supported), although I wouldn't go any higher as the device only has 2GB of RAM (stock). If the increased shared memory doesn't fix it, try putting memtest onto a USB and booting into that. Let it run through at least 1 pass of tests, which may take quite awhile. If ANY errors come up in the test, your system RAM is suspect.
If none of these bring up any errors, than some other piece of hardware is/has failed - most likely the CPU/GPU is overheating, or the CPU/GPU itself is failing.
