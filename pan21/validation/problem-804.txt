Are there other features that I havent thought of that would be desirable?  THe camera will be placed outside the doors of a small server closet in a building located an hour away.  Because I share this closet with staff in the building (who use it for storage), the doors do not lock.  On-site staff are unable to police the area, which is located in a building that is open to the public.  The closet contains a rack, some switches, router, DHCP server, and misc cables and spare hardware.  
I use a lot of Rittal's CMC rack kit, this is for very secure racks and detects motion, attack etc and has multiple web-cam support (as well as remote door opening too) but it would work for this scenario.
I need to monitor a remote location (server room) from both the local network and the internet preferably.  I also need the ability to record-on-event (such as motion detection), run a process on event (such as email me), and capture stills.  Additionally I need an interface that will allow 2 or 3 users to view the feed simultaneously.
