It could also be a hard drive going bye-bye.  I know the sound all too well.  :(  Is it a whirring sound, maybe like a faint lawnmower sound?  Or is a clicking?
If it is a capacitor ready to burst, you'll need to do some soldering if you intend to try and replace them yourself.
My laptop makes a squealing sound every time I plug it in and it "charges" the battery. The battery is long dead, and is probably dead in a 4 year old laptop as well. Either that or you have dirty power coming into your laptop. Unfortunately for me, it squeals with both the battery and the power cord plugged in, but once the battery is "charged" the squealing goes away. 
A squealing noise could be a few things. Commonly it is a problem with a dying battery. Check to see if this occurs when on AC power only.
Regardless of what the problem is, if you don't have a backup of your data already, now would be a really good time to make one. It may not sound like the HDD, but it very well could be. As a result of another part breaking, it could damage the disk as well.
If you keep your laptop plugged in all the time and you've checked the screen, fans and hard drive as stated above, then you have nothing to worry about other than a minor annoyance.
