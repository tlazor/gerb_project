Depending on your BIOS, you can reset the password using the jumper.  Change the configuration of the jumper to 2-3 instead of 1-2 (simply done by moving the jumper).
If you still have an OS on the system, you can try using the CGSecurity tool CmosPwd. It works on a large verity of BIOS types.
Resetting the BIOS usually requires setting a jumper on the motherboard. It's almost always a 3 pin header where you move to jumper to the other position for 5 to 30 seconds then move it back. It can be labelled things like "BIOS Clear", "BIOS Reset", "Clear RTC" etc. 
Sometimes backdoor passwords are not worked on the system. I have MSI-7529 Motherboard i have tried all ami passwords but it cant worked. After that i found one tool TROUBLESHOOTERS BIOS CRACKER while searching on internet, it worked on my system, so you can also try it. You can Search it on google TROUBLESHOOTERS BIOS CRACKER or I give the link below.
Once done, you'll be able to enter the administration side of the BIOS which will have a setting to reset all passwords related to the BIOS.  Once you have removed the passwords, shut the machine down then put the jumper back in the orginal order (should be 1-2) and then turn the machine back on.  You should now be able to enter the BIOS without any password.
