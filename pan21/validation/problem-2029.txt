As snapshots, they should be fairly lightweight after the first one, right? If you took hourly snapshots during business hours, wouldn't that drastically reduce the amount of files that didn't make it into a snapshot before deletion?
Third party applications like Undelete can do this - but I think Microsoft simply considers a file share as not really a document system. For storing, keeping version control over and handling important documents - something else is needed. Like the mentioned Sharepoint (though I can't say I enjoy the user experience of it) or some other of all the document management systems out there.
I do agree with the SharePoint idea from smearp though. The Recycle Bin is great but I also notice that users treat a web interface differently than an explorer interface. It's like they are more hesitant to delete stuff. Any phsychologists in the house?
You could also check your backup solution and see if you can go to continuous backup instead of daily for the share. Most backup applications these days should have that at least as an add-on. That way, if supported on the server, all changes will be backed up as they occur, or with only a few minutes delay. This is a nice feature to aim at a disk backup system with a few days of history at most - while keeping nightly backups for longer as usual on tape or whatnot.
I don't know of a Recycle Bin for file shares, but this is a place where SharePoint stands out.  SharePoint has two levels of recycle bins, one for users and one for admins, that capture deletes before you have to resort to restoring from a backup.
Just something to consider if one of the other ServerFault gurus can't point you to a recycle bin for file shares.
Not to be too snarky but if you have Volume Shadow Copies turned on and are doing all the other standard backup stuff then its time for the user to take responsibility for that one.
I'm not terribly familiar with the Volume Shadow Copy feature, so maybe there's a technical limitation I'm not aware of, but why not just take more frequent snapshots?
