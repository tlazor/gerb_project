The Share and Advanced Sharing permissions are different views of the same thing.  Obviously, Advanced Sharing has some more advanced options, (like offline availability), I don't have a machine with simple sharing enabled so I cant give a definitive list.
The permissions on the security tab apply to anyone accessing the files, it doesn't matter if they are accessing the file locally or through a network share.  The Share permissions apply to users trying to access the share.  Access to file is only gained if both the share permissions and the normal file permissions allow it.
You should also be aware that by default, the windows local security policy will prevent users who don't have a password from accessing files via a network share.
Share permissions can be used to setup very complex permissions.  I would suggest leaving the share permissions fairly open.  I don't know how many users you are giving access to or if they require read or modify permissions, but I would suggest granting the Authenticated Users group the appropriate permissions.
