In this mode it will barge in and take over the lease for any client which broadcasts on the network. This avoids long timeouts when a machine wakes up on a new network.
Performance is perfectly adequate for a guest network which will only be used occasionally (~20mbps download and upload).
While I haven't solved the problem of roaming between NATted wifi networks, I've worked around the problem by using a combination of VLANs and bridging.  The reason I thought I couldn't use bridging was because of the need to specify firewall rules on just the wireless part of the bridge and also because I thought my wireless devices didn't support that but it turns out they do.  However by creating a virtual interface with a VLAN tag and bridging that with the wireless AP, I'm able to specify the iptables rules needed to create a guest network to include physical ports as well as a guest wifi network.  Multiple guest APs can now use the same DHCP server (dnsmasq) and are completely separate (as far as I can tell) from my main LAN despite using the same ports and wireless devices.  The only very minor downside is that the Raspberry PI 3 wireless chipset doesn't support virtual interfaces but I've overcome this with a Â£5 wireless dongle which does.
So on the Raspberry PI acting as the router, firewall and wifi access point for the guest network I'm using the following packages:
