The other option is to enforce a logon script that manually copies the files to the user's own profile if they don't already exist. Try these instructions. This is the more reliable method IMHO, because you're literally putting the file exactly where VMware would naturally expect it to be, and you don't have to worry about having two preferences.ini (one in All Users and one in the user's profile) and the possibility of conflicts, etc. You can just drop in a default copy of the preferences file, checking in your script whether or not it already exists before doing the copy.
There is an All Users profile that lets you store custom profile data for all users. The data is overlayed on top of all user profiles, even existing ones and new ones that are created later.
So you'd just put C:\Users\foo\AppData\Roaming\VMware\preferences.ini into C:\Users\All Users\AppData\Roaming\VMware\preferences.ini along with any other files that may be required to ensure a consistent vmware profile. Be warned, however, that I haven't tried this, and it's entirely possible that VMware may choose to write their software not to even look at All Users, or Default User, or anything but the actual current user's profile.
