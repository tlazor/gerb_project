One of our Dell PowerEdge LCDs was showing "CPU 2 machine check error", but I couldn't find anything in the logs regarding MCE or "Hardware Error."  I cleared the message, but I wanted to run the machine through some heavy stuff to see if I could make it stumble again.
For testing the CPU you can run primenumber crunching programs i.e mprime or other stress tests like compiling huge amounts of code to verify that the calculations are correct. The longer these run the better. 
These running fine still give you no guarantee whatsoever. If one of these tests fails you at least have a way to reproduce. 
Machine Check Error on the other hand looks like something you really should report to the vendor, even if you can't reproduce it. Your machine could run fine for weeks and months even with testing but at the most unfortunate moment will crash again. 
I utilized an infinite loop bash script executed 64 times (once for each core) for a few minutes.  Then I used a program called "stress" to do the same thing with CPU and memory.  My question is, what is a sufficient amount before it's generally OK to say, "okay, this machine is good to go"?  A few minutes?  An hour?  As long as CPU temps remain OK?
For memory: At least several hours using memtest86. The more time you can spend on it the better. Everything below 3 hours is not reliable at all from my experience. I'd say let it run at least 12 to 24 hours to be certain.
