I wanted to disable the Autoconfiguration Wizard for when I setup a new email account, because it always got in the way and even tried to find a "valid" configuration when setting up tunneled (localhost:1993) mail server endpoints. I tried to disable it altogether by setting the following options in the Config Editor:
Set Thunderbird to "offline mode", then go through the wizard.  It won't attempt the tests and you can select "advanced" and it should drop you back to the accounts configuration page and continue setting up there.
Finally, click on Advanced config instead of "Done" and the well-known "Account Settings" window should come up with the account now already in place.
I don't know of any way to disable the new account wizard but you could add an account with fake information and then set it to not automatically check the mail for that account.  Thunderbird should stop bugging you about adding a new account and it shouldn't cause any problems (unless you click 'get mail' for that account).
Now, when setting up a new email account, the Autoconfiguration Wizard is still printing Looking up configuration: Mozilla ISP Database after the first step, but one is now able to click on Manual Config and fill out all fields manually. Make sure no "Auto" or "Autodetect" fields remain, as we don't want autodetection:
