Let's say I have a pivot table with a 100 rows. Make sure these reference columns (Columns E and F) drag the formulas down to 100. Now, once you filter, using a slicer, you'll notice only some of Column E and F are populated, and the are zero (because the filtered pivot table doesn't go that far down.
This will give you two columns of data, and you can use the instructions from the above post to make it into a scatterplot. 
So, to fix this, change the formulas in column e and f to, for example for B2, make D2 contain =if(B2>0,B2,NA())
The problem? Now you're table will have a bunch of Points at (0,0) which might mess up trendlines, etc. 
The cool thing about NA() is that it is not included in the graph. Thus, you have a pivot table you can filter and the scatterplot graph automatically gets updated without any unnecessary zeros. 
If you want to make the graph able to change with the pivot table filters, you can create a pivot table with the 2 columns of data (Let's say Column A has the label, and B and C have the data), and then reference those two columns in another two columns( ex. make the cells in Column E, for example make E2 contain =B2 and then make the cells in Column F, for example make F2 contian =C2).
