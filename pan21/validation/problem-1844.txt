If you do what you suggest you are still going to have to fiddle with BIOS boot device priority and I would not be surprised if you still got the boot loader hosed every now and then when updating.
The GRUB (or GRUB2) installers will add your windows partition to the grub boot and your will be able to choose which one you want.
I want to install Windows and Linux on 1 system. However, according to this resource, Windows will overwrite the Grub (of Linux) during updates and Linux will overwrite the boot sector (of Windows) during updates. Will installing the 2 operating systems on different HDD's/SSD's make sure that they just can live in peace instead of constantly wrecking each other's boot partition?
I do this all of the time.  My current box is running Windows 10 and Debian9 on the same drive.  The secret here is to figure out the partition scheme ahead of time and install Windows first.  Linux installs seem to play nicely these days.
This is what I have on my ultrabook Linux on a 32gb M1 drive and Windows 7 on a 512gb SSD. And I have this on my desktop, Linux on a 512 gb hhd and Windows 10 on a 512 SSD.
As the question you linked states there is a fairly simple way to recover grub. If you are going to be doing dual booting it is a useful skill to acquire as grub getting hosed will happen. It is only a matter of time.
Yes, they can play nicely. For this you need to install Windows in one of the drive first as usual. Then install linux in the second drive, this is where grub is going to "live". I have had Windows 10 and Xunbuntu for more than a year without hiccups on boot, even with updates on both systems. I can't say the same about Windows itlsef with the "creators update" oh the horror.
IF you install windows 2nd, it will be a pain in the butt as Windows will wipe the MBR with it's own boot loader.  Getting grub back is a pain in the rear.
A perk is that if you disconnect the drive containing linux, your rig will boot to Windows by default. If you disconnect your Windows drive, you will se an entry on grub for it. If you choose it, it error and reboot.
