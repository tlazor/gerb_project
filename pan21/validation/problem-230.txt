Add the new group, and make them a member of "Administrators". So long as your PCs are joined to the domain, and you give your techies membership of this group, they can log on using their personal Active Directory accounts, rather than sharing a local administrator account (which gives you much more accountability!).
I work on a small network that runs on windows server 2003, and with machines running xp. Is there a group policy that could push a new user name and password to replace our old local administrator user accounts?
(I really enjoy doing "trapdoor" scripts like this. I use them to run SYSOCMGR the first time a new PC is joined to the domain, etc.)
I use a computer startup script to do this for local "Administrator" passwords, combined with a "trap door" group membership so that the script only runs once.
You can attach a startup script for the computer account. This can check the existence of a user and if it's not there, create it. The catch is ensuring the password is encrypted in some manner. However, it sounds like you just want to rename the administrator account. If so, see Keith's response. You can rename via GPO and that's the way to go. Setting the password is more difficult and can't be done directly via GPO except through a startup script.
Your mileage may vary when using this technique on laptops or machines that are often disconnected from AD, of course.
For re-setting the password, we've simply set them all on installation to ridiculously long strings, then created a "Workstation Admin" group in Active Directory; then, using Group Policy, go to:
