If I recall correctly, you can enter system deatils and the Product IDs in WAIK and it will automatically map Product IDs to hardware.
I actually posted more details about this else where: http://starvinggeek87.blogspot.com/2013/05/useing-windows-deployment-service-to.html
The only way I was able to get it to work correctly was by braking it up into 4 parts as shown and set RequiresUserInput to true (don't ask me why it just would work otherewise 
Another option is to have the Windows 7 installer prompt the user at install time and teach the user how to find the Product ID when needed. Maybe Dell has attached the Product ID on a sticker somewhere on the systems.
first you will need to copy the OEM cert and SLP.bat files from your Dell OEM CD.The OEM Cert is located on the CD under sources\$OEM$\$$\system32\OEM and is called OEM (XrML Digital License). slp.bat is located under sources\$OEM$\$$\setup\scripts.
I understand about using the AIK to create the answer file but my question is about what "Product Key" to use in the answer file, if any ??
We use Dell Computers here and we are wanting to create a standard Desktop Image for Deployment. We only have the OEM copy of Windows 7 Professional that ships with each system.
