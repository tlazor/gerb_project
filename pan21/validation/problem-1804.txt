A sysadmin can set up honey pots, dummy computers to fool hackers into thinking that they're a real system with real data. In the honey pot all activity is monitored and the behaviour of the hacker is studied to help learn more about what a hacker or virus is trying to do to help security experts figure out how to prevent future intrusions. 
How to detect it depends a lot on what it is you're serving. As part of our backup system I have a script that mirrors the our company web sites to an internal server, transferring only what has changed. At the end of that the script parses the logs looking for any changes, additions or deletions and sends me an email if any are found. That way, even if there is a less than obvious change, I will (should?) find out about it. Of course the script lives on the internal server, not the web server.
Then the company reacts to this, goes through their logs to try and discover the extent of the problem and what happened, patches the hole, etc. and then (probably) issues a press release and tries to contact affected customers.
I would guess that most of the high publicity hacks we hear about start with either the company, or the media, being tipped off by an end user that someone has messed with their account/stolen their identity/etc.
