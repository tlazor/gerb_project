I didn't know you could use nslookup to run the same test from a different DNS server, and they all returned the result without a fail. I'd assumed that if other DNS global server checks were showing the records correctly in 95% of servers, my own ISP surely wouldn't be the culprit. Lesson learned. Thanks to @HBruijn for prompting me to revisit nslookup.
You'll have to lower your TTL at least TTL seconds before the change: the new TTL can't change what has already been cached, and you'd need to wait until the former TTL expires.
While I need the catchall wildcard A Record for Domain-A for other reasons, I did try an explicit A Record of the domains subdomain and it didn't improve the situation.
Also, while everything else suggests that this probably isn't the problem here, correct DNS records always have FQDNs with the tailing . i.e. literally your www.example.com. CNAME,
With my other domain drew.zimbo.com the above method did not work because the cpanel for zimbo.com does not have the option to link with other domains.
Have I overlooked something in my DNS records or should I be searching elsewhere for the culprit? I can visit domains.domain-a.com directly no problem so this leads me to believe it's not an error with any DNS records between my server host and domain-a DNS records.
This method worked for me when I pointed my domain andrewmutenga.com on Google domains to andrew.000webhostapp.com on 000webhost.
Various DNS diagnostic sites suggest, after 24 hours, that DNS caches throughtout the world are up-to-date with my latest DNS records, which are as follows (and with the same registrar, though this shouldn't be necessary and may likely not be in the future):
You are probably updating your records with some tool rather than editing the actual zone file. However, when giving configuration without the actual domains, this kind of details should be corrected, first.
I'm attempting to get domain-b to direct to domain-a and feel like I've done it via a CNAME to a pretty standard method. Yet I'm still getting ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED / server DNS address could not be found when trying www.domain-b.com. 
The DNS records were fine and it turns out my ISP is just badly delayed in updating its DNS caches, despite low TTL numbers in my records. It was my lack of experience with the nslookup tool that made me miss this. I saw nothing unusual with the results, returning Got SERVFAIL reply as expected.
