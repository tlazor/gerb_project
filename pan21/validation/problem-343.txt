This is of course not exactly what I had in mind. I really wanted to have to the liberty to display a range from a different sheet in any other place in a different sheet. For that, Scott's approach is better suited.
In addition to that, calc will only insert one field of the defined NAME, in order to see the rest, you have to drag out vertically and/or horizontally to get all fields.
Via Insert -> Names -> Define I can define a range and name it (the Help is not really helpful again or at least uninituitive).
But when inserting a name in different sheet via Insert -> Names -> Insert.., the following must be true: In order to get anything sensible out of the defined Name, you have to insert into the absolutely same fields as in the original sheet, otherwise cald will display a generic #VALUE! error
Thanks for hint. Basically, this seems to be a useful feature although it's not very user-friendly. As a matter of fact, I'm only halfway there...
Thanks, dragging works although you can't directly drag diagonally. It's either first vertically and then horizontally or vice versa
