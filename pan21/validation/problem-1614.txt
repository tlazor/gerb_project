I need to push corporate wallpaper through AD GPO on client system, I have created a shared folder on server with .jpg file in it and given its shared path is GPO for setting up wallpaper.
Now the problem is that whenever we change wallpaper file in shared folder it does not get updated on client system. Client system still shows previously applied wallpaper.
This is because when the computers run group policy, they don't see a newer version number for the wallpaper GPO they have, and therefore don't reprocess the GPO, so they use the settings they cached when they fetched that GPO.  Try running a gpupdate /force on one of the computers with the old wallpaper to verify that this is the cause.  (If the wallpaper updates after running that command, that's the problem).
Going forward, you can deal with this by either following up a wallpaper change with a gpupdate /force to all your clients, or by simply making a change in the GPO after a wallpaper change.  Personally, I'd recommend changing the GPO - the most obvious way that comes to mind is by changing the filename of the wallpaper each time (add a version number to the end, for example, corpwallpaperv2.png) and updating the GPO to fetch to the new version.
Strange thing is on client system under "Personalize---> Desktop Background" it shows newly updated wallpaper's thumbnail image, but it is not getting applied.
As I was figuring out Group Policy I also ran into this problem where the wallpaper wasn't changing even though group policy had been applied and the picture in the menu had changed. This was because Wallpaper settings are a policy that requires a log off before they will apply properly. It took me ages to find a place that actually said that and it was aggravating me to no end. Maybe this may be irrelevant to you at this point but I hope it helps somebody.
Some one are mentioning below ideas but practically this is not possible because how many time we will do same thing. We are using 200 system so how we can go one by one...?
