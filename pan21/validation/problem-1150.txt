A PC automatically acquires a 169.254.x.x/16 address if it does not receive an IP address from a DHCP server. If you disable the DHCP server on your home or lab network and issue the "ipconfig/release" and "ipconfig/renew" commands, your PC will receive a 169.254.x.x address.
In simple words, at the time of booting up, OS tries to configure an address on its interface through various methods like -
Link-local addresses are used for communication between two hosts (which are there on the same link) when no other IP address is specified.
When IPv6 was developed, many things were built into it that had been optional, add-on features of IPv4. Link-Local addressing was one of them. Every IPv6 interface is going to get a Link-Local address so that a device can at least communicate on the local link, and, as a built-in feature, many things, e.g. routing protocols, use it for communications on the local link.
In IPv4, every interface use to have only one address whereas in IPv6, we can have multiple addresses on a single interface (like link-local, global address on an interface).
And if OS doesn't able to configure an address on the interface through any of the automatic methods, then it configure an address on the interface from link-local pool.
Because of the imitation of having one address on an interface in IPv4, you may not have seen an address of range 169.254.0.0/16 on interface.
Link-Local addresses are required for the operation IPv6, but not for IPv4. Microsoft, among others, has developed the APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) standard using IPv4 Link-Local addressing, but it is not mandatory or supported by all OSes. I also have seen people misuse IPv4 Link-Local addresses by manually assigning and subnetting them, and that is against RFC 3927, Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses, which is a standard.
