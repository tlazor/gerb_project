Due to high demand, it is possible to start a career in data science without a formal degree. My experience is that having a degree is often a 'requirement' in job descriptions, but if the employer is desperate enough, then that won't matter. In general, it's harder to get into large corporations with formalized job application processes than smaller companies without them. "Knowing people" can get you a long way, in either case.
What it comes down to is your ability to show potential employers that you have a genuine interest in the field, and that you will be able to learn quickly on the job. The more knowledge you have, the more projects you can share in a portfolio, and the more work experience under your belt, the higher level jobs that will be available to you. You may have to start  in an entry level position first.
You are correct in noting that advanced statistics and other mathematics are very hard to learn independently. It is a matter of how badly you want to make the career change. While some people do have 'natural talent' in mathematics, everybody does have to do the work to learn. Some may learn more quickly, but everybody has to take the time to learn. 
Advanced analytics on big data platforms are valuable, to be sure, but many companies need to learn to crawl before they can run. 
In my experience to have a PhD doesn't mean necessarily be good in the enviroment of data science company, I work as data scientist and I'm just an engineer but I've known some universitary teachers who works in collaboration with my company and sometimes I've said them that Their point of view was not right because despite of their ideas and reasonings were right they are not applicables to the company activities, so we had to modify some data models to make them usefull for the company and the results lost their value so we had to seek new models. What I mean is that Data Science is a multidisciplinar area so many different people working together is needed so I think that your skills could be very useful in a data scientist team, you only have to find where you fit ;)
What this means for you is that the advanced analytics isn't as necessary for that company as just getting something up and running might be. 
I could suggest ways to study mathematics independently, but that isn't part of your question. For now, just know that it's hard, but possible if you are determined to make a career change. Strike while the iron is hot (while demand is high).
Luckily for you, most of the components said companies might need are free.  Moreover, I believe both Hortonworks and Cloudera have free "sandbox" virtual machines, which you can run on your PC, to play around with and get your bearings. 
Keep in mind that "big data" is an increasingly trendy thing for a company to say they're involved in.  Higher ups might read an article about it in HBR, and say to themselves, "I've got to get me some of that" (not that they're necessarily wrong). 
May be it will be a little offtopic, but I'd like to highly recommend you to go through this MOOC https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics. This is a very good and clear introduction to statistics. It give you a base principles about core field in data science. I hope it will be a good start point for beginning friendship between you and statistics.
