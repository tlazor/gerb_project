"do_not_create_any_shortcuts":true  works like a champ, however, it MUST be placed in the "distribution:" section of the master_preferences file, ie:
This one was VERY tricky, since Google Chrome doesn't use any of the conventional means to pin an icon to the taskbar and the desktop.  However, there is a specific area of the registry that, if deleted, prevents this behavior.  The contents of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components{8A69D345-D564-463c-AFF1-A69D9E530F96} in .reg file format are:
{"homepage":... "distribution":{"skip_first_run_ui":false,"import_search_engine":false,"do_not_create_any_shortcuts":true}...}
I recommend leaving Active Setup for Chrome alone (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components{8A69D345-D564-463c-AFF1-A69D9E530F96} for 32bit, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components{8A69D345-D564-463c-AFF1-A69D9E530F96} for 64bit).
this may be a irrelevant to you, but at any point to you click and perhaps hold the icon a bit too long, which activates the move/sort icon action of icons on the bar? or actually moved the chrome icon on your bar? if either of these are true this will be what is happening for you.
...then Chrome stops pinning itself to everything with every new user.  In testing, the only ill effect is that it seems you will need to add a shortcut to Chrome to the Start Menu (I guess the setup.exe program adds the shortcut as well).
if you move an icons position on the bar while its open it will also add it as pinned to that place.
