If you do install cygwin and want to use find in cygwin, make sure the find in cygwin is called by either using full path or insert cygwin bin path before system32 because Windows also has a find.exe.
ATTRIB works much better, because it finds more. (Why this difference? Why would MS make one utility work one way and another work different in this respect? Damned if I know.) In my experience the most effective way to handle this, although it's a kludge, is to get two listings:
I also played with windows version of ls command and there also no luck. To display full path you must add asterisk (mydir\*) at the end of directory you are listing, but this makes it recursive.
Somehow like dir /b command but I need also hidden and system files there. Built in dir command doesn't allow to list such 'hidden' files with the rest and I must use /s to have full path in there, which is of course non recursive.
I wanted to work with a directory listing, so I Googled "Print a Directory".  I found instructions to do so, but they included changes to the Registry.  Not wanting to diddle with this, and wanting to use a listing, not print it, I found a way to meet my goals without changing the Registry.  I created two batch file programs to be saved in a Utility Directory.  Then, when I wanted to print or work with a directory, I just copy the appropriate batch file into the subject directory, then execute it!  Here they are:
and get the difference between them. That difference is the directories on C: (except the ones that are too well hidden). For C:, I'd usually do this running as administrator.
DIR doesn't traverse correctly all the directory trees you want, in particular not the ones on C:. It simply gives up in places because of different protections.
