Because the device uses dedicated hardware to encode the frames and stream them over ethernet, it will be very smooth and high FPS and reliable. It also greatly simplifies your software setup, eliminating the need for expensive pipeline solutions on your gaming rig.
You can use the in home streaming from steam. Mine works VERY well with my desktop connected via Gigabit LAN, and the laptop on 5Ghz AC. Just remember to go through the settings and check the box to prioritize the steam traffic while streaming.
There are some more options now.  If you have a recent Nvidia graphics card, you can have the benefits of hardware accelerated capture, without the extra hardware.  It's called "Gamestream" You can buy one of the Nvidia devices supporting the protocol, or you can download an open source app called "Moonlight" http://moonlight-stream.com 
If you don't want to spend any money, and can live with extreme lag and very low FPS, you can try something like writing a pipeline in Gstreamer or VideoLAN (VLC) to capture the local framebuffer, encode it in some video codec, and stream it via Shout or RTP or RTSP or similar streaming protocol, then download/stream it from your slower computer. But as I warned you, this will be slow.
