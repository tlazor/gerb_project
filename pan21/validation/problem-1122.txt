This may be stating the obvious, but make sure you download the driver to match the 32/64 bit version of Win 2003 you have. The link you posted was for the 32 bit version. Also on the driver page for your motherboard there is an 'Adaptec Option' RAID driver in addition to the one you downloaded. Have you tried this one as well?.
In addition to verifying Windows Server sees the floppy, you may need to check with Tyan support to verify the correct driver.  I had an S3950 running WS 2003 at the time and had to contact them because they had the wrong driver on their website and I had a case open with them until they found it.  Actually, I did some digging and found the third-party driver that it actually was, but Tyan eventually came back with the same information.  RAID drivers != not necessarily SATA drivers.
I cant add comments yet, but I would also agree that nlite is the easiest option to integrate the drivers.
I'm a Linux/Unix guy, and I don't know if this applies there, but I remember a particular problem installing the driver for a RAID controller on WS2003 with an USB floppy drive : depending upon the drive make/model, the first stage of WS2003 installer loads the floppy correctly, but the second stage ( after the "starting up windows" message ) can't access the floppy drive and load the driver.
I'm not sure what chipset your Tyan board is using, but I found out the RAID chipset vendor was sold to another party, which eventually let its support wither away so I ended up getting a RAID card anyway.
For information: I know how to boot on a USB Floppy disk drive, or USB stick. I also updated the BIOS and made my ARRAY a few time to make sure I wasn't making something stupid!
