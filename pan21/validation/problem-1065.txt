I was having the same issue.  I was able to fix it on my Asus ultrabook after I upgraded to Windows 8.  I was really annoyed that I had to enter my windows live password every time I started the computer.  I followed the instructions I found online to turn off that password option.  
I was also concerned there was no "Hibernate" shut down option in Metro.  I was able to add it there as well.
When I started experiencing the not waking from sleep issue, I went to the control panel and power options.  I noticed that there was an option that required a password to wake from sleep.  I believe that was the conflict.  I changed that to no password require to wake from sleep.  Solved the problem.  I will note that I had to click "Change settings that are currently unavailable" to make those changes.  You can find that just above the option for what the computer does when you close the lid, hit the power button, and the sleep button.
I have a Toshiba laptop that I just upgraded to Windows 8 and had the same issue. Apparently, when upgrading, the system defaults to not allowing the computer to wake when opening the lid or by pushing buttons or moving the mouse. So, what I did to fix this is I went to COntrol Panel, System & Security, Power Options and then selected the Panel Open-Power On. Once in there I just went through the tabs and selected enable where applicable.
I had the same problem on my ASUS laptop. It came with windows 8 standard and then I upgraded to windows 8.1 pro, after which, my computer wouldn't come out of sleep. All I needed to do was upgrade my drivers, specifically my Realtek PCI family controller drivers.
