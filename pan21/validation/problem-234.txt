Look for keys within there that have numbers corresponding to country/region codes in Windows.  The US Keyboard should be 409 and the Dutch (Netherlands) one 413.  If you find and remove any of the 413 references, it may end this problem.  
If none of this works, you can check out some registry locations and see if the language is listed there.  Manually changing the registry can severely damage your Windows installation.  Use caution and at your own risk. The most likely candidate locations are:
One option you might try is to install the language and regions that are missing, then uninstall them.  If that does make them go away, you might want to copy the existing region settings to the "default" profile by going to Control Panel >> Region >> Administrative and clicking the Copy settings... button.  
If any of these steps fixes it but it all comes back after a reboot, then it's something in your corporate setup (GPO, server script, etc.) that is pushing it back out.  Your only recourse there is probably to contact your IT department and have them fix it.
