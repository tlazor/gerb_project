Print a test page with the network configuration from the printers.  If they have a NIC in them the test page should display the mac.  I believe LaserJets also have the mac printed on one of the physical labels on the case.  You might have to open a drawer or lift a lid somewhere to find it, depending on what model LJ.
I would try a broadcast ping to 255.255.255.255 from a linux box (Windows does not allow this) given they are on the same switch. Then have a look at the arp-cache for any responses using
When you did a 'test page', did you do it from the client machine or the printer?... if you did it from the client machine, I doubt you'll get good information about network settings of the printer (specially if you're connecting through USB).
The Network configuration page lists the current settings and properties of the all-in-one. To print the Network configuration page from the all-in-one, complete the following steps:
The arp cache lookup will also work if you can somehow connect to the device using a configuration tool (even if does not show you the MAC address).
