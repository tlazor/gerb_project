The gateway ip for my network is 192.168.0.1 and the gateway for openVPN is 10.8.0.1. I have done trace route and it shows that the websites that don't work access 192.168.0.1 and not 10.8.0.1. Is this proof that it is not going though the VPN?
Look at the routing table....netstat -r.  Yes you can change routing by modifications of the routing tables and/or using iptables.
With both utilities you should hopefully get a trace of the route that packets take to reach the destination.  You'll be able to tell if it's passing through your VPN gateway.
You can use a tool like Wireshark to "sniff" the traffic on your local network. Wireshark will allow you to see which traffic is going where based on the source and destination IP addresses.
Set up Wireshark on an interface that is between the hosts you want to test. Wireshark is a passive listener, so it won't interfere with your traffic.
I have a openVPN set up on the server and I am using openVPN connect for my client. I have some internal websites that I need to access and some of them don't work. I want to make sure that when the traffic is going through the VPN and not though the normal internet connection.
