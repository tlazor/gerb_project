I've worked in multiple shops with multiple ways of handling things.  The first was by far the scariest but seemed to work...
We also had terrible turn-over rates on those jobs and much difficulty recruiting for the night/evening shifts... Of course the non-peak shifts were only staffed with "operator" level employees with technical back-up on call. Basically management was unwilling to pay well enough to get highly technical resources to do night shifts, especially if they had families.
My second experience with an on call 24x7 situation has been MUCH better.  We have a 24x7 call center/NOC staff that takes all customer calls and server pages.  Based on the issue, they will call the on call person for the appropriate group.  My group does week long rotations.  With the week schedule and the size of my team (6 guys) I'm on call every month or so. I've been paged 2x this year while on call so its a pretty good average.  The compensation is the same as the last, if you work well into the night, sleep in, take your time getting into work.
One of the place I worked at had a 24/7 monitoring center. It took basically 10 staffers to fill all the slots, to have "spares" and to have a manager in charge. The biggest problem was the graveyard shift (2400-0800) since there was basically one guy coming off shift (in the entire building) and one guy coming on shift. Any delays meant automatic overtime for the guy on shift and if the midnight guy was a no show, a nice 16 hours shift.
24/7 coverage is challenging. 168 hours a week, every week. I've done it in other jobs but not in IT. In theory you can do it with 5 or 6 people, but 8 is more realistic. You also have the challenge on dividing up the shifts and weekends. Plan carefully.
I admin 75-100 servers (physical and virtual) in a 24x7x365 environment. It's a financial services company with worldwide clients, so the service itself can have no downtime. We've got 4 physical sites (2 datacenters, 2 offices) with a small userbase (around 20 users total, varying from very technical to very non-technical). There's around 40TB of SAN storage and 5 WAN links. 
We were a small shop of 4 admins that was on call for our customers that bought the extend 24x7 support contracts with their appliances.   The 4 admins would rotate on-call nightly M-TH and then F,Sat,Sun was 1 guy which rotated through the 4 admins.  Typically, if you were on call on Monday, you had the F,S,S shift but then weren't on call again until Wednesday the next week, and then Tuesday the following week etc.   The calls after 8 PM went directly to a paging agency that would field the calls and page the on call person after filling out a trouble ticket.  At first, it seemed like it was going to be a complicated system and we would never be getting any sleep.  But for the most part, we had very few pages.  Depending on the stability of the code or a flare up the issues might be in the range of 1-2 a night.  But typically it was 4-5 per week.  Compensation was strictly in time off.  If you worked all night, you weren't expected to be in the next day.  But being such a small shop, you never were fully away from work.
