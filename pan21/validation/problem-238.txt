Once you have a highly available file server cluster, the Hyper-V hosts can be configured in a manner that is clustered, or not, to your tastes.  If you do cluster the compute hosts, then the VMs will themselves be highly available.
You also need HBAs in the storage cluster that either do no caching or RAID in hardware or can have that turned off, so that the physical disks in the enclosures are directly visible to the Windows file server cluster nodes.
Lastly, you need all the disks in the enclosures to be SAS disks that support SCSI-3 persistent reservations.
You can have high availability in that kind of configuration if you make the storage cluster highly available and configure it so that the SMB shares are "continuously available."  In order to set that up, you need at least two machines in the file server cluster and you need SAS connections from each of the file servers to each of the enclosures.  You need the enclosures have to be on the list of ones that are compatible with clustered Storage Spaces, and I have no idea whether that particular one from HP is.  As your HP rep.
