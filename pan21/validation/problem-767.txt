The answer is then that you can't distribute the workload automatically. The most you can do is share your hard disks between the two computers, and launch your heavy tasks on the desktop thru Remote Desktop or VNC. However, please take note that while large files are transferring between the laptop and the desktop, both machines will most likely be too occupied for other tasks.
The reason for this is the difficulty in moving work to another machine.  There is a lot of complexity involved in moving to different hardware and memory.  Unless the program is made to handle this complexity, it isn't possible to make it work.
You also refer to clustering, which is the same : only used by large and specialized software products, for example database servers like SQL Server or Oracle.
These applications are not cheap though and require knowledge to set up.  This is not really a home based solution.
The only seamless solution in existence is distributed processing, of which the world's greatest example is the Google internal network. However, this requires specialized software and is not supported by any utility I know.
Many 3D applications can render to remote machines as can professional video and audio editing software. If you develop, you could always get the desktop to compile stuff, perhaps when you check in code to SVN use hook to autobuild the software.
There are commercial solutions out there that can something similar.  However, they are enterprise level software products.  Citrix, VMWare, Microsoft, and others Im sure, have the ability to make applications look like they are running on your PC, however they are in fact running on a remote server.  
You can use the desktop via VNC or Remote Desktop, but you said you don't want that.  You want the work to seemlessly move to the desktop when the laptop hits 100% CPU usage.  You may be able to find specific applications that can do this, but there is no general purpose solution for doing so.
