If none of those techniques worked, and it was my system, I would cut my losses and build a new system... so I had something to work with, then in my leisure time replace components in the failing system until it works, then sell the refurbished system.
Another cause of reboots is too high temperature. Is your system cooled enough? Are the fans correctly running to evacuate hot air from the CPU and from the case? It could be that the CPU fan/radiator is not correctly attached and thus the CPU is not cooled correctly. 
I have had some cases where the fan (were in power supply and cpu) was blocked by dust bunnies. Cleaned it and everything was ok.
I suggest running SpeedFan or a similar utility to monitor the temperature of your components (and make sure you fans are running). If that doesn't indicate any particular problems, Brian's suggestion of blowing out the dust is a good idea. If you're still having problems, try running a burn-in test (a bootable CD that goes through and exercises your CPU, GPU, RAM). Hopefully, it will crash again and identify the failing component. If it crashes seemingly randomly, then it's probably a motherboard or power supply issue.
How can you tell the power supply is stable and tested? Have you tested it in another system? It's usually the most common cause of reboots.
I saw this behavior on a machine one time.  Turns out the heatsink on the CPU was caked in dust.  Everything was fine after cleaning with a can of compressed air.
