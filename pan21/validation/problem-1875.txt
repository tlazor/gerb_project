You may also want to have a look at debsums that checks files for modificatons since their installation through the package manager.
If you install the package debsums you can run the program like debsums -a this will check the md5sum of all the installed files and configurations.
If the server is kept up to date then cross comparing with a fresh install of the same version of debian with the same packages installed may be a good option. Obviously that doesn't work so well if you don't want to update the server (I guess you coul make an image of the server and update that but that opens up a can of worms of it's own).
Likewise if that server was to be replaced with a new server, you want to make sure all of the configuration differences (compared to the base install) have been transferred (or ignored if no longer relevant - e.g. a rouge "Port" line being added to sshd_config).
To see if any non-configuration files from debian packages have been modified since the package you can use debsums. 
Checking for configuration file modifications is difficult because configuration files can be managed in several different ways. If they are "conffiles" then dpkg will know if they are been modified but many configuration files are not.
Please note that some packages do not install the configuration files or content.  Instead these files are created by those packages at install time.  These files will not be in the file list associated with the package or the md5sums list.  As far as the package system is concerned, these are data files that it doesn't own.
For context, imagine inheriting an old server that can't be formatted, and you want to check that every file is as it should be... I know this won't be the case when upgrading between versions of Debian, or after removing a package without "--purge", as it seems to leave allot of (typically config) files behind.
Is it possible to list every file on the system that does not belong to a package? or if they have been modified?
All the files installed by a package can by seen by looking at the list cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list.  Most packages include md5sums for the file content which can be seen by look at cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.md5sums.  Some packages do not include these sums though.
Seeing if third party packages have been installed is trickier, you could probablly compare vernsion numbers and checksums against information from packages.debian.org but i'm not sure how difficult it would be to automate that.
I think you should install the etckeeper package first thing after you install the system. This package basically puts /etc into a version control system of your choosing (I prefer git).  With this in place you can see exactly what changed when.  It easy easy to clone this repository over to a new system and then do diffs against the new system.  So you can see exactly what is different been a source and destination system in a single command.
Both tiger and rkhunter will report files that do not belong to any installed package, amongst other things.
