Wouldn't it be easier (and kinder) to simply setup a shared "Sales" mailbox, let all the required salesdroids use it. Its never going to be as fast as a simple redirection, but there is no need to script it or anything then. (We use many here, allows users to change roles, get promoted, quit etc without having to worry about redirecting or informing customers of new addresses etc).
That way, users can "Grab" messages for themselves, by moving them into their own mailbox, or deleting them when done etc.. Also, looks professional when you see: Joe Bloggs on Behalf of Sales@company.com. If its the public folder, turn of "Maintain Per user Read/unread information.." then staff can tell when a message has already been read by someone else.
The managers like it, they can keep tabs on open items, weigh in on things and generally be "Managers".. ;-)
The other alternative (in Exchange) is a Public Folder, simply create & set permissions on it for all who will need access (using Outlook), then assign the email address[es] you require (in System Manager, will default to "Foldername@domainname.com"), then all mail will go there instead.. has similar/familiar delegation controls/permissions etc. If particular users need access to shared calendars or mailboxes, they can set them as "Favorites".
Customers like it, they get an easy to remember address and, their messages aren't lost! (that is the biggie I think)
