If Stephen's advice isn't quite working for you then make sure that you also have the following line in your apache config file:
Make sure you have your virtual hosts set up correctly such that each virtual host binds only to a single ip address.  The Apache documentation for IP based virtual hosting says that your virtual hosts should look similar to the following:
Also, FRB is right. You CAN have SSL on as many of these Virtual machines as you like. Just put the SSL config info inside the <VirtualHost></VirtualHost> code block.
Something like this (also notice that its not necessary to bind to specific IPs when using named hosts):
The first vitual host listed in your apache config is the default one.  Add a fake one before the your first two just to ensure that you are actually matching your virtual hosts, and not just blindly falling into the first one.   Here is a more complete article about such a setup from IBM: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21045922
So you don't actually need to duplicate the SSL* directives in each virtualhost, but it helps draw people's attention to the fact that it's an SSL site.  (Otherwise they'd have to notice the port number.)
You can actually do multiple SSL sites on the same IP address, without using SNI.  The (primary) catch is that you have to be using the same certificate, which must have all the required domains as Subject Alternative Names.  (These will make the cert cost extra.)  The implication is that all the sites are for the same organisation.
I have setup a Debian LAMP server where I host multiple websites. As far as I know I can only use SSL on one of them, if I'd like to use SSL on two or more sites I'd have to add another IP - so far so good.
Apache2 handles SSL in two phases.  The first phase involves checking for an "SSLEngine on" statement in the default (first) virtualhost block for the IP address, then starting the SSL connection.  The second phase involves checking the ServerName/ServerAlias directives until the correct virtualhost is identified.
The problem is that whenever I type https://siteone.com or https://sitetwo.com it always displays the content from: https://siteone.com. I'd rather it display some error message or something else but absolutely not to display my main site's content (which is where I want the SSL to work).
