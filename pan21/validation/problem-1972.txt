I installed the TFS on a Windows Server 2012 machine, the URL of the TFS is for example http://appsrv:10001/tfs. I can open the website if I'm in the same domain as the server but if I try to open it through the internet it does not work. I know the external IP of the router which is for example 100.100.100.100 and when I browse the URL http://100.100.100.100:10001/tfs it asks for the user name and password what I set during the installation of TFS. After I type in the proper credentials the URL in the browser changes to appsrv:10001/tfs. So the port forwarding is working and the firewall does not block me but the browser sais that "Cannot find the DNS address of 'appsrv' server". It is something with IIS but I don't know what to do.   
CAVEAT If you expose TFS to the public internet, you should setup SSL. This is relatively easy with 2017, as they added some tools.

You must configure TFS to serve the external URL. This can be done from the command line using TFSConfig, e.g.
