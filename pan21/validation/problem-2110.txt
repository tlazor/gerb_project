I've thought about this for some time, you should look into Zener Diodes, 12V car batteries (SLA) and home made battery chargers. Cheap and interesting.
EDIT: I see that your original link is from there! :-) I will actually be buying one of these this summer, as I notice that their selection has increased to include some ranged input voltage PSUs. Look at the M4 enclosure for mounting in a more traditional style. Then, you can run wires direct to your box. Visit your local hardware store for some good insulated options. Or, hack a cable to a power supply that you don't use any more, etc.
I have one computer that has a power supply that says it will work off of a DC power source, unfortunately it requires over 110 VDC, to power it.
One thing that I found particularly wasteful, was a Laptop, on a cart, with it's charger plugged into a UPS. Which means it took 110 VAC, converted it to ~12 VDC, converted that to 110 VAC, converting that to ~19 VDC, and then finally converting that to ~12 VDC, 5 VDC, and 3.3 VDC, and using the 12 VDC to power the back-light. Talk about stupid. It also had a separate keyboard, and mouse, because the only part you could get to was the screen.
I've seen mission critical data centers running off 24 12V in parallel and serial (several Amper-Hours at 24V) transformed to 220V.
