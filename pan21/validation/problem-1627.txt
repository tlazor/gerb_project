More specifically when the they restart the install process hangs with Fatal Error C0000034. I have been able to restore some PCs using System Restore or Recovery Images the remainder I seem to be able to fix from recovery console by restoring the registry manually.
Here is the solution I found for getting workstations back up and running again, mainly taken from this rather old question on TechNet:
9) SP1 will try to apply 3 times and fail. When it fails it will roll back to pre-SP1 and boot normally
It seems that at about 1700 GMT last night all of the Windows 7 PCs downloaded and offered Windows 7 SP1. My well trained highly technical users diligently installed SP1 which promptly hosed their computers.
(note: if you don't have a functioning local administrator account then you can not use this fix without using a SAM edit boot CD to override the local admin account)
I am looking after a small (12 PCs) network mostly made up of Windows 7 PCs about half 32-bit with the remainder 64-bit or Vista. WSUS is setup on the server and all computers are configured via group policy to retrieve updates from WSUS.
6) change to your local system disk (c: unless your HDD has other partitions for recovery etc...). You know it's the right disk if it has the folders "Windows" and "Program Files (x86)"
Anyone else experienced this today? and if so has anyone found a solution. I have blocked the installation of Win 7 SP1 with the SP1 blocker tool provided by Microsoft.
I am at a bit of a loss as to why SP1 has hosed all of the PCs at once, there is nothing unusual on there and all have been rebuilt within the last 8 months.
