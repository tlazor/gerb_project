It just occurs at the end of the section you inserted. If you added an empty line at the end of this section and then added your text before this empty line, you won't have this problem. Hope this helps..
I had the exact same issue. It has to do with 'page breaks'. Most likely you did the same thing I did and added a page break by going to the "Layout tab > Breaks > Next Page". For whatever reason, when you hit enter at the end of the page before the page break that you inserted, it'll bring your cursor 2 spaces to the right of your text, but when you start typing it'll appear on the next line. (There are two places where you can add a page break. This only happened to me when I used the "Layout tab" page break, not when I used the "Insert tab" page break option.)
To fix this, I had to open a new document, then copy and paste the text. Make sure not to copy and paste the parts where the page break is located. For the spot where the page break is located, I just manually re-typed the words. Not the best solution, but I couldn't figure out how to remove the page break, so I made a new document instead. Good Luck!
