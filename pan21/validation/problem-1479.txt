I work in an education reform office in a thrid-world country. My IT skills aren't the best, but they're the best around and I get asked to do a lot of things I don't really have the knowledge to manage.
I'm trying to set up an automated system for requesting, approving, and recording leave (like, vacation time from work). I've had a few ideas, but none of them seem good enough. I'll run them by you. THE CATCH IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE (and cannot get) A SERVER. More generally, we can't pay for anything.
2) An open-source tracking program. I was thinking something like http://www.orangehrm.com/ . Problem? Can't host this sucker. At least, I think I can't. I really don't know anything. If we have a website, could I host it? Would it be enough to have a computer running some of the time to provide occasional access?
i think you can check with LeaveMonitor system(www.LeaveMonitor.com). One of my friend get very discounted rate(almost free) as they are a charity organisation.
3) A wiki. This seems like a pretty sweet idea, actually. The idea being that I could create a whole bunch of pages with different permissions. Unfortunately, my limited google skills can only find hosted wikis WITHOUT free custom security (e.g. pbwiki). Bummer. Do you know anything better?
How about a shared calendar on Google calendar? I admit that it's not really tailored to your task, but it's free, quick to set up, and it should get the job done.
1) A buttload of gmail filters on a new account. Not too hard to set up, but very difficult to tabulate leave. Is there any good way to go through a bunch of emails and extract data from them? (I.E. create a list of how many leave days each worker has remaining.) I was thinking of using a mail client (thunderbird with IMAP)... but then... can I get data out easily?
