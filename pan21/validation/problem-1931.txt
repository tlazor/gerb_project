Open the form in acrobat (or whatever works). Click the form field button. Looks like a simple white rectangle, by default it may be hidden. Look for a button (maybe near advanced editing) that looks like a blue square. It has a dropdown next to it for the other form tools, get the white rectangle.
This is NOT fixed in 3.3.2 I'm having the same problem and cannot get text to show up properly in Adobe. This from a form that worked fine last year with Open Office. It was odd - when I edited the form, it said the font in use was (Default) and then if you enter the font setting it's 'Segoe UI'
Double click any of the form boxes. The options for that box pops up. Just change the font from the default (Arial MT) to, say, arial... or any other font. The text now centers properly. I guess either your chosen copy of arial is a little funny, or it's normal but the baseline got adjusted... something that's normally not possible in acrobat forms but might be possible when creating them through a 3rd party program.
I am using Libreoffice 3.3.2 . I can't replicate your error, even when I export your odt version to pdf, so I assume that this issue has been resolved in the current version of Libreoffice.
