In terms of operations and not cheap plastic case addons, they've been reliable machines. I've heard their quality has improved from the models I bought. 
We've (company I work for) used Silicon Mechanics for a while. Probably >20 servers from them, many of them with weird requirements, from low-end stuff (single-CPU, single-disk web servers) to multi-core, multi-CPU 16-disk DB servers, to weird stuff like telephony servers. We even got some Windows XP(!) servers from them fairly recently, no problems at all.
Almost all of it has worked perfectly with no problems. We've only ever had problems with three machines (one had a bad HDD backplane, found with intense testing on arrival, one had some RAM fail after the better part of a year, and the other was just Western Digital's lovely quality control), and their support (we just have the standard warranty) has been excellent. 
I have a Silicon Mechanics rack mount that I bought used. It is a dual socket Opteron system with a 3ware raid controller and I have had no hardware problems with it. A friend bought some used on Ebay and those have worked without hardware issues. My former employer has a dozen Silicon Mechanics boxes that they use for Test and Production. The only problems those boxes every had were software issues with our own code.
