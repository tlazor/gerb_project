Pre-initialize the QueryString object to avoid the issue.  Simply access Request.QueryString().  We don't have to do anything with it, just access it.
"The Params object is a collection of the QueryString, Form, Cookies, and ServerVariables object.   When the params object is first created it adds each one of these objects to its collection in the FillInParamsCollection method.   The first object to be stored is the QueryString object.  If this object is not yet created, which in our case it is not, the constructor for this object tries to fill in the QueryString object.  During this process it gets the encoding by calling a method on HttpRequest called GetEncodingFromHeaders().  This method specifically looks for a User-Agent that starts with "UP".  If so it tries to retrieve the "x-up-devcap-post-charset" header from the Headers collection.   However, since the Headers collection is not yet initialized it goes through its initialization routine as well.  One of the things its initialization routine does, is set the Params collection to NULL.   This is what causes the AV, when the FillInParamsCollection method tries to initialize the next object after the QueryString Object."
Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in .Net Framework 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5. Below is a quote from the e-mail I received from them:
