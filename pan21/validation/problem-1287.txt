I just came across a way to find out which databases the old PG_DATA directory contained. It's a bit hackish, and too late for me, but it might be useful for somebody else in the future.
Information about database names (etc) is not stored in PG_DATA/base, but rather in PG_DATA/global. The files in that directory are (in my case, at least) small enough to be inspected with hex editors or command line tools like grep and strings: 
Question 1: Is my understanding correct that in order to restore the old data, I would need a server with the same major+minor version as the one that wrote the old data directory? Since no 9.1 packages are available for my distribution, I would have to compile a v9.1.x server from source, copy over the old data, start the server and perform a normal pg_dump, which could then be restored to the new cluster?
The name of one of the default internal databases, "template1", occurs as plain text string in only two small files. Looking for other strings in those files reveals the other database names:
Question 2: There were around 10-15 databases on the old laptop, but since it was a development machine, in theory all of the data should be replacable, apart from some local experiments. I'm thinking of just scrapping the old data, but I can't remember with 100% certainty what those databases were. Is there a way to extract some basic information (such as database names, maybe even sizes or timestamps) from the old data directory without running a 9.1 server?
