So next, right click on desktop and select Graphic Properties to get the Intel Graphics Control Panel. There you can check if there are multiple displays listed and/or if you can activate some. For me, there was just one.
So that solved the problem for me. Just go through all the individual control panels for all the graphics cards and don't rely too much on default Windows display settings.
Finally, right click on desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel. Again, check in the multiple displays section, how many displays are listed and if any can be reactivated. For me, there were two and one of them could be activated.
Right click anywhere on your screen and select "Graphic Properties". When the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel comes up click the "Display" tab.
After repeating reboot a couple of times, I went to device manager and updated driver of the Nvidia graphics card using internet and rebooted again. That did it for me. All four monitors are working alright now. I didn't even have to reinstall CUDA toolkit for the new driver.
BTW, main reason I upgraded to Win 10 was that I can have %^&* Start menu back again. But to my surprise, the upgrading process was very smooth - I didn't even have to reinstall my software packages again - except for the display driver.  mess.
Basically, all I had to do, was figure out which graphics card is controlling each display and then setup that specific card in its own control panel.
I had a similar problem with NVidia driver. After upgrading to Win 10, only one monitor was working but the NVidia graphics card was not recognized in device manager. I tried to uninstall the driver installed for Win 8.1 in vain. Uninstaller said it couldn't uninstall any Nvidia-related software without any information on the reason.
