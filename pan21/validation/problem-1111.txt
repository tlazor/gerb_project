It is now almost 2017 and this problem has been around since before 2010, so I don't think it will ever get fixed.
I have the same problem only with 2 ReadyNas boxes and a share on my pc for 2008r2 users (so issue is not limited to nas box access). 
I have tried every solution I could find (most are not even related to my problem, as all seem specific to some other program) but the issue is a common complaint on the internet. Windows simply forgets its credentials! Manually entered, enter at time of login (and the save password option is totally useless). Why even bother to have a credentials manager, it only lasts for 1 day. What a joke. 
I've read about similar issues with iSCSI drives, but all the shares are on a Drobo connected to the server via FireWire and appearing as a local drive to the server (not iSCSI). I suspect the fact that the shares are on a Drobo are contributing to the issue, but I'm stumped as to where to start looking for a long-term fix, rather than a work-around.
Every time I reboot our Windows 2008 R2 server, shared folders are no longer shared. After every reboot, I need to RDC to the server, right click each folder I wish to share, then hit "Properties" and "Sharing." The desired share name is always intact, as are the proper permissions for Owner (always Administrator) and the appropriate R/W access I've previously set for groups and users. But the status shows as "Not Shared." If I press the "Share" button, it thinks for a while with the "This may take a few minutes" message, and then reports complete and the shares can be accessed from network clients again.
Since I enabled password access to the Nas boxes, every pc (w7, w8, w10, and server 2008r2 users) all need to authenticate (user/password) after every logon or reboot to connect to nas/pc shares.
