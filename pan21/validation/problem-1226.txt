With a properly-configured SPF record on domain1.com and domain2.com, you could have those domains on IPs 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2, but send e-mail from a server on IP 3.3.3.3, a server that could potentially have the domain name domain3.com, and no properly-configured mail server will reject it or flag it as spam (at least not due to the origin). (If you're worried about improperly-configured mail servers, don't -- nothing you can do about them, and they're so few anyway that's not worth worrying about anyway.) If you're worried about customer perception of seeing an e-mail purporting to be from domain1.com but having actually been sent by domain2.com, well, 99.9% of users will never know, and that 0.1% of users that do see that will know it doesn't mean anything.
Why does it matter so much that the IPs sending the mail match up with the domain it's coming from? It's extremely common for organizations to have dedicated SMTP servers that have wholly distinct IP addresses from the domains they claim to be sending mail from, or to even outsource the sending of mail from their apps altogether. Google's Gmail service is one such (very visible) example of the former, while anyone using a Google Apps domain (and sending via Google's SMTP server) is an example of the latter.
