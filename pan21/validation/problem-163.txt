you can now use sc.exe sdset... to change permissions, but you need to understand / learn this security descriptor language.
If an admin without permissions wants to stop the service, he/she can still start a process under local system and then stop the service, I don't think you can prevent that.
When I quickly need to change permissions on services, I rather use Process Hacker, it gives you a GUI option to set permissions on services, select the Services tab, find your service and on the property tab Security you can remove permissions for administrators. 
The best option is to have as few administrators as possible and restrict what people can do, using something like Just-Enough-Administration.
Also this is all about starting and stopping services, an administrator may still be able to kill the process for the service even if he/she doesn't have permissions to the service itself.
I would make sure that at least one user/group still has full access to the service. Also Local System usually should retain its permissions, otherwise the system/service control manager can't manage the service anymore.
