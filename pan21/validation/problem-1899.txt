I briefly hosted my own website on my desktop PC back in 2002 but I've never been great with networking.  I don't want great performance.  I just want to do this for the educational benefit and geeky thrill.  And I want a sandbox where I can put my programming and design experiments.
I go to icanhazip.com and grab my public IP address.  I throw it into a web browser and get...my Modem's admin interface.  I didn't expect that.  I spent an hour but was unable to get any further.
Try accessing your IP address through an external proxy such as proxify.com to see if that makes any difference.
You might try the guides provided from Verizon about how to setup port forwarding. I found one here:
The Time Capsule is setup to forward traffic on port 80 to the Mac Mini (it's default web server is enabled).
Look in your modem's settings for something to the effect of "Remote Management" or "Technician Remote Access."  Turn it off.
You could also try connecting on a non-standard port. It would at least let you know that the port forwarding is working. To access a non-standard port, put a colon (" : ") followed by the port number to your URL.

What am I missing?  I expected to see the router's admin screen when I hit its internal IP address but I am surprised (and a tiny bit frightened) that I see its admin screen from its external IP address.  Should I setup a DMZ (do I give it the router's outward-facing IP?)?
