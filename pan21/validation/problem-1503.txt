I'm looking to build a classifier to solve this problem.  Specifically, I'm looking for the correct way to incorporate the constraint that I am only able to open 100 boxes in the test sample. Put another way, my measure of performance is limited to a subsample of my test data, so I need a classifier that is highly accurate when it predicts the highest likelihoods. Prediction errors outside of these 100 boxes are of zero concern.  
I'm working on machine learning problem where I'm only interested in getting high accuracy within a narrow band of my predicted likelihoods. Specifically, I want an algorithm that will score very accurately when it predicts a likelihood above a specific threshold. 
2) Can I modify the loss function used on my training set to produce a high localized accuracy within these specific 100 boxes?  
I'm aware of cost-weighted loss functions that penalize false positives/negatives differently, but I'm not familiar with any that solve this specific problem of optimizing for a localized accuracy.
I'm presented with 1 million closed boxes, 10 percent of which contain a gold coin. The likelihood of a box containing a gold coin is associated with physical characteristics of the boxes. I'm allowed to open 500K boxes, chosen at random, to see which contain the coins.  After this, I'm allowed to choose 100 of the remaining 500K boxes and keep any gold that I find.
