To make the program more useful, I'd at least consider having it take its input from a file, formatted something like this:
If you want to make this useful (rather than purely a programming exercise), I think you'd probably be (much) better off changing its basic nature.
This allows the user to enter exactly the data they care about. It lets them enter data as it happens, then run the program to get totals at (for example) the end of the month or end of quarter (or whatever). The input they used is in a file, so it's saved for records. It's also fairly easy to write the code to allow arbitrary categories, so (for example) an automotive maintenance shop might use "spark plugs", "air cleaners", and "oil changes".
Third, the sequence is fixed, so if I have 10 items in one category, and none in any of the others, I need to enter 0 into each of the other 4 categories 10 times over just to enter my 10 items.
Second, the basic idea of it is that it works only in a single batch. That is, I need to enter all the data at once, and then it spits out an answer. The next time, I have to start over from the beginning.
Right now, I see a few basic problems. First of all, the names of the categories are fixed. Some may not apply in some situations. Some may be far too coarse in others.
