I have recently configured a unit connected via NFS to 2 VMware hosts and so far my daily management guy can't see any performance issues.
You can also load OpenFiler successfully onto Hyper-V - just setup the ethernet adapter as legacy adapter.
The only gotchas that I've run into in the past is that sometimes complex ACLs don't behave as expected, although I ran into this personally about two years ago, so it is very possible that those bugs are fixed.
Another is reliability taking into account various human error factors (non-standard configuration, experimenting, non-standard sequencse of changes in configuration, etc). I'd rate FreeNAS really low on that. It's so easy to shoot yourself in a foot and lose your data. You can read the forums to get the idea, but if you try it yourself, you'll have it too :)
I dont have direct direct experience with FreeNas, but I would suggest that you try OpenFiler instead. Like FreeNas, it is is Free and Unix based. OpenFiler is a more commercialized product with many commercial production implementations.
We have experimented with more cutting-edge hardware using RAID and more drives.  Getting newer hardware running has been difficult, so we may end up using Ubuntu for its excellent hardware support and OpenFiler on top.
I also suggest that you host your OpenFiler on ESXi, and you will be able to share the machine with other VMs if the system is powerful enough and will not be heavily loaded by other VM's.
I have run FreeNAS boxes for nearly a year with good success.  I generally use them as backup devices to local storage so performance isn't of the utmost important.  The current systems I have are HPaq 2 GHz P4 with a single 1.5 TB drive.  As I remember when we benchmarked about 6 months ago we could get something like 40 MB sustained over a GB connection using NFS.  I have used iSCSI as well but not at this point.
As it was already mentioned above, FreeNAS seems to be really geared towards enterprise consumers and ignorant of home users and their problems. Speaking of expensive server grade hardware with have multiple vdevs tens of drives in each, FreeNAS server that manages it, and an operational engineer who manages the server. 
If you are a home user or small business user willing to have simple file sharing over 3-9T array perhaps with all the nice ZFS redundancy and checksumming features, but you also want to save money and you're used to the idea that a fileserver can run on cheap hardware, don't even try FreeNAS, it's not cost-effective, unless you (a) want to make it a serious hobby project and it's fun for you to spend time on this, (b) you're ready to invest much more money on upgrading (or completely replacing) your setup as you figure out your hardware won't work.
If you are about to commit data that you care about to this product please consider the following points:
Reliability has different components to it. One is how reliable it is to go all the way with recommended hardware in mainstream configuration, set it up once, then NOT touch it, and watch how reliable things are. I'd rate FreeNAS pretty high on that.
I am one of such users, I've been trying FreeNAS for 2.5 months already. I've spent the entire Christmas and New Year's holidays on initial setup, plus a bunch of evenings and weekends. It's somewhat fun, but feels really dangerous. Due to bugs or too non-standard configuration, I've experienced loss of 1 drive in 4-drive Raid-Z some 5 times already, and during 2 of them I've hit unrecoverable read errors during resilvering. Most of that happened when I was detaching and re-importing volumes or reapplying encryption. I am somewhat worried that if 1 drive loss is possible due to noob-ish handling of server setup even without real hardware disk failure, you need Raid-Z2 or Raid-Z3 just to mitigate that. I've been very paranoid with continuous snapshotting to an external drive for backups, and it saved me multiple times. Though I did have a couple of unrecoverable read errors on external drive that I had to deal with, and I am guessing this is due to the fact I used USB 3.0 which is NOT recommended (read: it's not supported and there are possible bugs). I also had problems with an SSD drive I used for L2ARC reporting errors, which disappear after I remove and re-attach it, however, it was impossible to wipe it: I had to disable checks, wipe it with dd, and reboot so that OS would refresh its knowledge about disk metadata, only then it allowed me to re-partition the drive and re-add it. There are more things of this kind that I had to go through.
