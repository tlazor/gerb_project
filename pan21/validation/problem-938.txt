My understanding was pf blocked the packets from reaching the kernel, so if it was configured properly these messages would go away. Is that correct?
Have I properly interpreted the tcpdump lines? (The carat direction makes it look like it's only outbound packets?) 
I've tried to use pf to blacklist this IP, block ICMP access to this port (or in general, since it seems like ICMP is not port based?), and tried a custom rule to block:
After rebooting and watching with tcpdump again traffic appears much more normal (a handful of different IPs looking at various ports over the course of an hour).
I found the traffic is coming from a single host by running sudo tcpdump -ni en0 "icmp[0]=3 and icmp[1]=3"
Perhaps all the "udp port 27960 unreachable" messages were due to a previously opened connection that was not closed properly?
Where 64.......125 is my server's IP and I assume 185.......98 is the requester (that's the only IP seen in 1000's of log lines)
If it's not correct, do I need to take action based on the requests, or should I just follow the instructions for nullifying the log lines?
Happy to hear possible explanations of why pf didn't block this activity initially, but it seems fine now.
