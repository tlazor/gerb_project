You should also get some experience with decisions that do not map neatly on to the data.  Recommender systems are easy in this regard.  For example, you might take on the challenge of evaluating software vulnerabilities to guide vulnerability management decisions.
So far the answers have focused on learning particular methods. They are fine, but they won't make you a Data Scientist. Being a Data Scientist is not solely or even primarily about having mastery of particular data analysis methods (ML or others).
You need to start getting first-hand experience with data in your field.  I don't mean Kaggle data (i.e. already cleaned).  I mean raw data or nearly raw. A good 50% of a data scientist's time is spent wrangling raw data and cleaning it to the point where it's usable in analysis.  You need to learn how to deal with missing data, erroneous data, ambiguous data, misformatted data, and so on.
Most fundamental is problem solving and decision support. What ever data you collect, what ever analysis methods you apply, and however you improve those methods over time, these must support the over-arching goals of solving problems or making better decisions.
