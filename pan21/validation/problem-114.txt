This won't be a permanent fix, and it may reduce in effectiveness over time. But it should be enough to keep your monitor functional until a replacement can be obtained.
Obviously, if the monitor is under any kind of warranty it should be returned to the manufacturer or place of purchase.
CAUTION: I can't guarantee this will fix the issue. It may even make it worse, but it's not like the monitor is reliable at the moment anyway.
I remember baking a Samsung monitor that was giving some issues just like this. This is obviously going to void any warranty, but you can remove the image processing board from the other parts in display, and place the board in an oven.
The problem is either with the video connection (on the outside), or with the image processor (on the inside).
This issue is likely a loose connection on the LCD. I would suggest applying direct pressure front to back above (or below) the 'jagged lines'. If the problem is minimised or goes away, a temporary solution can reached by attaching a bulldog clip to the bezel of the damaged area.
There's videos of this on YouTube (DIY Monitor Repair), but what the baking does is "resolder" connections on the board. The Samsung monitor I was dealing with was made when the company was changing over from Lead to Lead-Less solder. I found that it works for a year or more, then needs another good bake.
It looks like LCD display inside your monitor is physically damaged. Fixing it probably isn't worth it, so your best bet is to buy a new screen.
