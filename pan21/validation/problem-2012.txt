I don't know whether it's the "fastest", but I use TeamViewer for both Mac-to-Mac and Mac-to-Win screen sharing and it works well and with a little tweaking (quality all the way down), it's let me help people on extremely poor connections (say, GPRS dongles).
Just plain VNC will work between pretty much any platform, so long as you have a client and server. Mac OS X has built-in VNC capabilities accessible through the Sharing preferences, and a built-in VNC client located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app. For Windows, UltraVNC is a fairly good server/client program. As JP mentioned, you can also use RDP when controlling a Windows computer, and there's an official Mac RDP client available.
Another great cross-platform product (with free and other paid versions, though for Mac only the free version exists) is LogMeIn. They also have an iPhone client, which is great for traveling without a laptop.
I've been using LogMeIn. I've only used it between Windows machines, but it seems to work quite well. They have a Mac version available.
Personally, I like doing it with RDP if I'm going Mac to Windows.  But, also gotomypc is (surprisingly) very good too.
