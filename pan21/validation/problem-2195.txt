And I had to add this to ~/.screenrc to enable mouse scrolling from inside the window (still not with the sliders):
You can also change the scrollback history size in a running screen with the sequence CTRL-a : (enter screen command-line mode), then scrollback 10000 if you want 10k lines of history buffer. The change applies immediately.
When you start screen you can specify the size of the scrollback buffer with -h, so you can increase it from the default of 100 lines.   However, with a currently running screen, once the data has left the buffer, it is gone.
You can also run your commands in the script command which will log the output to disk.  Or you can:  command 2>&1 | tee /tmp/cmd.out to log the output for future investigation in you wanted a (practically) infinite sized output history.
I was able to scroll with the cursor inside the text using &uparrow; and &downarrow;  after I hit CRTL + a and then ESC.
However, like @William Pursell said, with a currently running screen, once the data has left the buffer, it is gone.
