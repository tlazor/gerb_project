This runs an agent that continually backs up your data, and has a very easy restore-entire-server-to-bare-metal feature. If it was free it'd be the perfect backup solution :)
Symantec has an online storage offering available at http://www.spn.com that's designed with servers in mind.
You just need a server to backup to - any of the commercial subversion hosts will do for this, a backup repo is exactly the same as an other subversion repo, and to use it if the live server dies, just requires you to "svn relocate" to the backup repo url.
You don't need to be logged in, and you can sync from the backup server - to pull changes from the live repo, or from the subversion server - to push changes to the backup. If the backup server is not present, the next time svnsync runs it will grab all the changes, so you don't have to worry at all.
But that's a solution for entire servers. If you want to backup a subversion repository, there's only 1 thing you need - svnsync. Its easy to use it - create a repo on the backup server, initialise it, then sync it. After the initial copy is complete, you can run svnsync regularly to copy all incremental changes over, so its fast. In fact, its so fast that most people place the command to run it in their post-commit and post-revprop-change hooks. So the backup server is always completely up to date. (I run it hourly, but I'm just perverse like that).
Just to comment on the Carbonite part of your question - yes, it suffers from the same failing. You must be logged in for it to work. Having used both extensively with different clients, I can say that mozy offers a superior product overall, with far better CS and a lot more control over how it operates.
There is Records Management & Archiving in the US, similar services to Iron Mountain, but cheaper.  They also offer a colo service as well.
