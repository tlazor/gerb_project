I'd also advise you download a separate internet browser for your banking, shopping, etc.  It's a small measure but anything is better than nothing.  
Lastly, if you are in the US, pay the 10 dollars and get a quick copy of all your credit reports from the Big Three agencies.  Scan them annually and you should be fine.
In general, a public access point isn't the most ideal method.  I don't think it invites criminals like parking in the wrong neighborhood however. Probably want to get the router configured to use protected wireless(WPA). They ask that you use a password of 8 or more characters.  10 or more would be my recommendation.
The best way to protect your identity is to restrict what you download. Harmless facebook games, little widgets, etc are what I'm talking about.  Keep in mind, while these folks who wrote the program are probably not after your money, the programs have that capability.  
It helps to know what OS you use.  But I assume you are using Windows because you are using IE.   Most of the characteristics you describe  are kind of vague.
