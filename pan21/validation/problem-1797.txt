With regards to the part about recurisivity, say for instance you have a block of data comprised by the bytes "ABCD" and another block comprised by the bytes "GHIJ."  Each block might have a fingerprint of "01" and "02,"  or four bytes.  Instead of transmitting all four bytes, the algorithm takes a fingerprint of "0102" (both fingerprints together), which might produce a fingerprint of "03."  If the destination file has the same fingerprint-of-fingerprints, then it can be assumed that all of the underlying blocks are unchanged, and do not need to be transmitted.
The part about "Incrementally" is simply saying that the Hash Window can "slide" by taking a byte off the front of the window, and adding the next byte to the end of the window.  Thus the window can slide incrementally from the beginning of a file to the end in order to detect "shifts" between instances of a file.  Say, for instance, you have a Text Document.  The fingerprints are generated from the blocks of data from that Text Document.  Then, at a later time, you add a paragraph of text to the beginning of that Text Document.  The window could start at the beginning, and increment through the file until it matches a block for which it already has a fingerprint.
