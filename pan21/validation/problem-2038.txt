Now I work for a medium-sized company which is highly organized and they gave me a job description on the first day. Not everyone knows what I do, but my manager and everyone above him does, and everyone in my area does. Chaos is probably common, but there are good places to work out there.
That's where the frameworks help out.  I'd introduce some sort of management framework as a way to smooth out all these problems.  It's not a magic bullet but it goes a long way to solve this type of problem.  Of course getting buy in for a solutions framework is likely to be a challenge.
I previously worked for a small-sized company with organizational issues and misunderstanding about what my job entailed. Employees were wearing too many hats and reporting to too many different people. I managed to get them to make a little bit of headway towards cleaning that up after much complaining. I also tried to push for job descriptions (nobody had one), but it never happened. I managed to maintain my sanity by building a simple web-based task management system. Any time the pointy-haired boss wanted something done immediately, I would either sit down with him and reprioritize or ask him which things he wanted to scrap.
You have to look at this environment and decide if this is where you want to be long term.  If not, keep your eyes open for opportunities.  You'll have to work at it a bit but eventually you should be able to find an environment where you'll be happier.
Only if you work in a mismanaged IT department.  IT needs to be an extension of the business goals of the company.  I'm a big fan of ITIL or MOF as a way to organize IT as it gets IT to realize that the business is not a "customer" (like the old 80's mcdonald's IT management style tried to push) but a partner.  It's overall Job is to deliver the options on how to solve or enhance a particular business problem.  If politics and or inertia, selective hearing make the business decide to choose a different option than what you consider the "best", you have to remember that it's not your decision and you might not be in possesion of all the facts that brought the business to the decision.
I somewhat answered this in another answer recently but this is a good topic. One of the key issues between IT and "the Others" (sue me, I'm a Lost fan) is that in the Dharmaville we call IT, we know what we're doing. We're happy. We understand our parts (for most part) and know how to do it well (again, for most part). The problem comes in how IT is utilized. In the past IT was the hammer that drove the nails. We came out, provided dumb terminals and as long as the mainframe and network were up nobody really questioned anything. Nowadays IT NEEDS to be seen as BUSINESS PARTNER. Nothing gets done without IT involvement now and when people fail to realize that you can't plan to put in a massive product and not even know if 1) It really will help anything 2) If it even works with what we have and if it doesn't what do we need to do to get there. We need to evolve our thinking and update our policies and procedures to accept these new changes or we'll always be stuck in the same old rut.
If this is the situation you face then the departmental IT management has issues or their is a lack of communication between you and your manager.  The IT management should have a clear vision of what they are delivering to the organization and some sort of metrics to show how you're doing.  It's also their responsibility to deliver recognition to those who perform well and reward appropriately.
