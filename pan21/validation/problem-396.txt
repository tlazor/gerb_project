Don't forget, you can simply press the record button in excel, perform the action of your choice, press the stop button, and you have your macro. Then you need to edit it so it becomes a dynamic macro (works for any cell etc).
Make all the date cells unlocked, and protect the worksheet. Users can freely click and edit those cells, but not the rest. Using Data validation, you can make sure they enter a date only.
Given that SuperUser is not a "Please write me a script" kind of service, this is as far as my answer can go. If you start working on your VBA macro and you have questions, post your code as a new question and we can help you locate where things go wrong.
Given that this will require VBA to work, you do not need to worry about allowing selecting locked cells. You will need to add buttons or make VBA understand that it has to do something when the user clicks on a cell, and then in the macro temporarily remove the protection, change the content of the cell, add the protection back.
