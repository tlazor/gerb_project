You might want to try off-loading as much of the disk-IO as possible onto an external SAN.  (A drobo would do the job pretty well)  It sounds like the host simply can't handle the amount of IO.   Also it might be useful to make sure chipset & disk controller drivers are installed & up-to-date.
Check explorer.exe by double clicking it in Process hacker and look at Performance Tab.  Here's what mine looked like while copying a VM folder (containing several, various sized vmdk files).  
It looks like you have 2 SATA drives and I would guess that there is more activity on the 1TB drive.  You didn't say what type of drives but I would also suspect that they do not support NCQ (which would help a little). Clearly you have an IO bottleneck.    The optiplex 960 as configured would not be able to handle large IO loads since I believe the 2 disks share the same bus ( the onboard is a port multiplier).  You might try purchasing an additional sata card (my suggestion http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816318008&cm_re=pci_express_sata--16-318-008--Product) or something similar.  I've tried to use desktops in the past as server and run into similar headaches to the point where now I'll just pick up a cheap server.  HP has an ML 110 series that starts at $400 (and that's with a core i3).  Server chipsets are almost always multilane sata controllers.
Start a file copying and then begin sorting through the data displayed looking for anything that looks odd.  
I had a similar problem: Windows 2008, VMware server and a low end server with SATA drives. Network performance and local copy of big files were poor. After investigating I discovered that SATA mode was in emulated IDE in BIOS configuration. Changed to SATA native and performance increased slightly. However SATA drives are not the best idea for virtualization. Three vms and other tasks from the host means the drives access will be a bottleneck.
Check out the bottom window that shows my I/O.  I watched and saw that it dropped to zero as it finished each file.
