Based on these readings, is there reason to be alarmed with this laptop? Should i run even more tests, or even worse, return it while my warranty is still up?
Ive never owned a SSD equipped laptop before, only HDDs ones, so this temperature is alarming to me, now it doesnt go below 49 degrees even idle, and the CPU stays in the range 50-65 degrees. Ive read that SSDs run on different temperatures than HDDs and on SanDisk official page, it says that the range of operations on the drive is 0-70 degrees.
I recently bought a used Thinkpad X1 Carbon, it had Windows 7 installed, and on a first check, the SanDisk SSD ran around 43-45 degrees, i then installed Windows 8.1 and on installing Visual Studio 2013, i watched it rise to 56 degrees. 
What can u tell me about this readings, i took them with CrystalDiskInfo, and if it helps, i havent yet installed any drivers to it, including the ones related to the solid drive, dont know if that makes a difference. The readings also show that the Power On Count was 1400 and the Power On Hours of the drive were 880 hours.
