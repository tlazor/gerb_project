Does anybody have any idea on how to get information to do this? I'm sure Azure must support it. . .
IF you are creating a farm, you are going to need to use an Azure load-balancer to route the requests to the web servers in your farm. 
SharePoint does have it's caveats regarding the SSL certificates and the request URL, and needs to have the SSL certificate loaded through SharePoint central management. That is a different topic than what is being asked here. Alternatively, you can use Application Request Routing (ARR) and use SSL off loading to route to http ports on your SharePoint farm.  
I have been tasked with figuring out how to setup a SharePoint 2016 farm in AZURE IAAS with VMs. I have a dev farm setup with a virtual network with DC, SQL, Single Farm VM. I have an internal domain name that's demo.mydomain.com that works for the intranet but making it accessible from the internet is the problem. I have public DNS names for each server at servername.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com and I can access my team site from the internet with the "Public DNS Name" of the Single Farm VM. 
Once you can resolve the name, then you just need to assign it to a new web application or extend an existing web application to a new zone that uses that name:
However, I want to access the SP website from the internet with the internal domain name (that would be the easiest) or with another custom domain name, if that's not possible. The only article I can find is https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10065/associating-a-custom-domain-name-and-securing-communication-with-azure but I don't think this is the right article because it's talking about a cloudapp.net, not cloudapp.azure.com. Also, it just talks about setting up a CNAME or an A RECORD on your domain name providers website to point to the "Public DNS Name" and I need to build this farm out to include Workflow Manager and Office Online server using SSL which is a far more complicated domain scenario.
