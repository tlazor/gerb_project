It's a little bit cheating, but if everything is only attached to one end device, you can turn on port security with sticky mac addresses.  Check back in a while (however long you expect is a reasonable amount of time to assume that someone would have used the computer or it doesn't exist) and the running config will show you if anything has used that port.  I'm pretty sure you can use sticky mac addresses with a max of more than 1 per interface just in case you're using VoIP phones and computers on the same port, but I'm not certain.
I usually use "show interface status" and variations on it but I also use a neat piece of open-source software called "Switchmap" to provide a simple graphical view of the interfaces. One great benefit of this is that if a port is up/down it will tell you how long ago it last had traffic on it and you can make a call from there as whether you should reuse it or not.
I think that in Cisco environment the best way is to a show version to know the uptime of the switch and after
