The most-vulnerable point here is the initial client-to-server transmission. If somebody snooped those packets, they could see messages not technically intended for them. You could encrypt the data, but that's a lot of effort for only minimal gain. The client must be able to decrypt chat packets eventually, and intercepting the packets as they leave the client would be the best place to do the aforementioned snooping, so the key is already available to the snooper, just a little harder to find.
It's very important that you pass your chat through a server that you are in control of, though. It need not be the game server, it can be a dedicated server for funneling chat, but you want to control the routing. It lets you have oversight for GM disputes, it lets you enforce user requests to block or mute other users, it solves the issues you might have with NAT punching or other networking shenanigans you can have trying to do peer-to-peer chat, and it provides enough of a barrier to casual hacking (which peer-to-peer chat is prone to) to solve 90% of the security concerns. Which is about as good as you'll get.
You're never going to really remove the ability for an outside party to intercept chat packets from clients, and you shouldn't worry too much, because when you're building an MMO you're building a game, not a industrial-strength crypographically secure chat platform.
