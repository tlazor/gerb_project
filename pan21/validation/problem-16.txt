Interestingly you might prefer to try running Windows8 on it; Windows was substantively rewritten in order to work better on low-end devices like tablets for Windows8, so you might find (counter-intutively) that upgrading past Windows7 might be better for your old machine than going just to Win7.
Try it and see. From the specs given it ought to run Windows7 without any problems, although it's towards the low end of the requirements, so it might be a bit slow when running lots of programs.
I would try this if the system meets everything this has then yes his computer can run windows 7. Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor
Your specs say you can install W7 on your laptop... Try 32-bit version and get Upadtes. You will probably have to install some drivers manually, but I think it will work.
If you've just got a new laptop you should be formatting and reinstalling the whole OS anyway, and if there's some good reason why Windows won't be able to run on that machine, the OS installer will tell you and abort.
