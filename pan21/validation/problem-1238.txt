Alternatively, using third-party software, it's generally recommended to decrypt first before imaging even though it might take some time. This is because imaging a bitlockered drive is usually not supported.
Remember that BitLocker provides full-volume encryption. You can easily use an online-based backup tool like Mozy or Carbonite, which will read the files from disk (decrypting them in the process) and then back them up to a separate cloud-based repository. These solutions typically provide their own encryption implementation. While you lose a bit of the bare-metal-restore capability of the Acronis solution, this may still be a viable alternative that's less expensive than deploying WHS. 
Does Windows 7 support Bitlocker using Complete PC Backup and Restore, and restore to replacement hardware?
Vista's "Complete PC Backup and Restore" is a bit clumsy in that it is difficult to restore the system to new hardware for the case of a lost / stolen laptop.
Acronis True Image treats Bitlocker images as black boxes; a backup is equal in size to the entire hard drive volume.  An incremental backup of a Bitlocker image results again in a backup equal to the size of the entire hard drive.
It seems that, the default "system image" function in Windows 7, does support bitlocker transparently. The backed up image will be unencrypted automatically.
I'm looking at using Bitlocker on a new laptop.  I have been using Acronis for full image backups; it would take me way too much time to reinstall and configure from scratch in the event of a stolen laptop.   I would like to do periodic full system backups with daily incremental backups.
