You can then use either this Windows based app or this web based app to wake your MacBook up remotely. There are a few other apps available to do the same thing, but you can search for those on your own.
If it works on the LAN, you're well on your way. You now need to have a router and forward the WOL traffic to the internal PC in question. Perhaps give the internal PC a static IP or a DHCP reservation so it never changes and the forwarding rule is always valid.
Wake on Lan does work over the internet, you just need to set your router to forward subnet directed broadcasts to your lan.
So in your routers firewall add a rule to forward data from UDP port (say) 7 to the internal networks broadcast address 
i.e. if your internal ip is 192.168.1.8 and subnet 255.255.255.0 then your broadcast address would be 192.168.1.255.
Wake on LAN works on layer 2 (MAC addresses). For anything to work on the internet, it needs to operate on layer 3 (IP addresses). You're out of luck.  Set it to never sleep or remote into another computer that's on the same network as the mac in order to wake it up.
It's possible to get WOL to work over the internet. However, does WOL even work on the LAN? Check a few things:
