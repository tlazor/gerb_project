As for why the cable no longer works properly....there could be many reasons. Fiber cabling is much less robust than copper cabling. If the cladding or PVC jacket has been worn away, light may be leaking at that point, which may be interfering with the missing wavelength.
I will edit this if you provide more details and I can give a better answer.  I am also going to go out on a limb and guess you have lost the lower wavelength and the upper wavelength is still working.
The upper wavelength has less attenuation as it travels through the fiber, so it will arrive at the receiving end with more power.  Starting from a point where both wavelengths are functional, if you introduce something into the environment which increases the attenuation, you can reduce the power on the lower wavelength so it is no longer functional.
You have already mentioned some of the causes that can increase attenuation, but I would look first at the fiber patch cords, dirty fiber, or fiber bends as causes.  Fiber patch cords are easily damaged and easily replaced.  You can easily take the opportunity to clean the fiber properly at this time (get a good non-alcohol based cleaning kit and a fiber scope).
The short answer is that fiber cabling is cheap enough that it is not worth your time or effort to fix a damaged cable in many instances. If you have doubts about a cable, you should just replace it if possible.
Basically, you have to decide if the effort to fix the cable (if its possible) will be less than running an entire new cable. Most of the time, such as in DC or enterprise environments, it will probably be much cheaper/easier to run a new cable.
In some cases, the fiber is not able to be easily replaced (eg, undersea cables). If, say, you have a long run between buildings, then you might be better off using a OTDR to locate a possible break, and fixing/splicing the cable at that point.
A visual fault indicator (i.e. a bright light source) can also help identify problems quickly in fiber depending on the situation.  Anywhere you see the light bleed out would indicate a loss of signal strength and the brighter the light the more loss you are experiencing.
