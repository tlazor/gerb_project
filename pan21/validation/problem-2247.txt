So for most people, TLSv1.0 is almost equivalent to SSLv3. The reason people still call the family of protocols SSL is because of historical reasons - everyone is used to the name, so they keep on using it. It is quite possible for the VPN to be using TLS under the cover, but the marketing name still stays as SSL VPN.
Since TLSv1.0, there have been two revisions of the standard and it is now at TLSv1.2, which while still compatible, has some significant changes. Because of the SSL/TLS design, both client and server can negotiate which version of the protocol they want to use, so clients using TLSv1.0 can still talk to servers implementing TLSv1.2 and vice versa.
I hope this clarifies the picture a bit. If not, let me know what is still confusing I will try to explain further.
Considering the interoperability between all the versions of the protocol, there is no "making a switch", since they are the same family. It is a question of "do I need to use newer version?". As with any other area, the answer to this question will depend on whether the current version you are using has any limitations or not. Currently there are no problems with using SSLv3, but the majority of clients and servers out there work with TLSv1.0.
SSL as already people pointed out is a protocol designed by Netscape in the past. At some point the IETF standards body decided to adopt the SSLv3 protocol as a standard one, so it got change very subtly and it was named TLSv1.0.
