Otherwise, Sun's Java usually installs somewhere into /opt/java* or /usr/lib/java* or sometimes /usr/java*. You'll find individual install directories there, such as /usr/java/jdk1.5.8. This is the directory that is your JAVA_HOME. Underneath it is /bin, where the binaries reside. Just run the javathere to check, e.g.
If you do not have a package manager or are trying to manually install the JDK, I assume you already got the correct version of the JDK From the Sun website.  You can find their Java SE downloads page here:  http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
Once you have got the packages installed (and I agree with other posters regarding their preference for official distro-specific packagings), pointing your browser at Sun's Java tester page should give you confirmation the browser plugin and therefore Java applets are working.
To install the browser plugin, find the plugin which will be somewhere under jree/plugin and just copy/symlink it into your browser's plugins folder. In firefox, about:plugins should then list Java.
If you're sure it was installed, but are unsure where it might have installed, you could try running updatedb and then using locate to find the java runtime:

If you're running a debian-based installation, I highly recommend you get the JDK from the repositories.  You can simply run the following in a terminal:
I'm not sure whether other distributions also carry Sun's JDK.  You may find openjdk-6-jdk to be an equivalent FOSS alternative.
This should give you an idea of the directory that you may need to add to the PATH environment variable.
If you've done all this, then running "java" at the terminal should just work.  If this doesn't, it could mean it wasn't installed correctly, or that it was simply installed into a location that isn't on your path.
