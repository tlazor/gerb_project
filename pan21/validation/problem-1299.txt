I currently use Xen in production to run a number of Ubuntu VMs (Intrepid/Jaunty).  I've got another server which I'd like to set up as a VM host to run more guest OSes, and am looking for the best options for our requirements:
There are probably some other things we'd like to have that I can't think of at the moment, but those are the two most prominent, and most difficult things to accomplish.
As for hardware, we're currently using the Dell R510s with 12 drives in RAID10 and 64GB RAM.  We find we're able to get around 20 on one of these pretty easily using a combination of paravirt and HVM guests.  
If you're not opposed to a commercial solution, you could look at something like Citrix Xenserver. The free version (Citrix Xenserver Free) is unlimited in terms of VM/host capacity, it supports shared storage and live migration of VMs between pooled hosts;t emplated installs and cloning of VMs; storage snapshots; and it has a graphical management tool.
KVM has already been mentioned, but for templates and rapid VM deployment, I suggest you take a look at RHEV - it's not free, but it does get you there.
I'm open to any other solutions: KVM, OpenVZ, etc... anything that can hopefully meet the requirements above.  As far as the host OS goes, we're currently running Debian, but I have no attachment to that.  We've been trying to get Xen running on CentOS or Debian Lenny to no avail, we just want something that works.  Any suggestions / advice would be much appreciated.
We've been using KVM on Debian Lenny for a while now.  Rock solid and didn't have any of the niggling issues that we had with Xen.
