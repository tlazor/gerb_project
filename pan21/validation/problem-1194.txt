Do not use Windows Media Player; install an alternative.   Windows Media Player allows media files to prompt the user to download things. "You need a special codec to play this video. Click to install FOO.EXE."
NoScript can be obtrusive, and requires user education. (If the user just blindly says yes to all scripts, it is pointless.)
Configure windows/softwares and then "Freeze" the windows partition using something like faronics deepfreeze.
What steps should a paranoid user take to make his Windows 7 setup as secure as possible, aside from cutting the network cable?
I'm more than a little nervous. I'm very skilled in hardening Linux systems, but I'm a fish out of water when it comes to Windows. I've installed Microsoft Security Essentials and have Windows Firewall enabled, but I still feel like that's not quite enough (I saw a few viruses get past Security Essentials before I switched my wife from Windows Vista to Linux. Granted, she probably helped them by...she's quick to click things).
This way, any suspicious activity will require an Administrator password at the elevation prompt (sudo equivalent)
Install Evince for reading PDF's; stay away from Adobe. (There is a way to get Evince to show embedded in Firefox: http://www.libertexto.org/libertexto_en.html .)
Set up Windows 7 with a normal user account beside the Administrator account, just as you'd do on Linux. It's virtually impossible to really screw up the entire PC with just a normal user account.
This will definitely protect you from all kinds of malware by preventing any lasting changes to windows files or settings.
Train your users not to download and open any untrusted attachments received over e-mail and never to say yes to any unexpected dialog box.
I am historically a Linux guy, and only use Windows when I absolutely have to via VM. However, I recently purchased a new rig so that I can keep a dedicated Windows 7 machine up for hard work (cough,gaming,cough) and for software which just won't run on Linux.
If a Windows machine is being used as a web client, a good idea is to use Firefox with the NoScript add-on. (And of course Adblock Plus; that goes without saying.)
