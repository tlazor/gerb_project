Now change to /etc/grub.d/ where you should find a script  called 30-os-prober. This script will scan the hard disks for other operating systems and add them to the boot menu. Therefor as root you should execute this script:
I have a triple boot windows 7, ubuntu 10.10, ubuntu 11.10 and i want to delete the partitiion containing 11.10 but that's where my grub is located I believe.  Because it updated to grub 1.99 when I downloaded installed 11.10.  How can I change this so that even after the partition is deleted I can use grub.
You don't have to boot from exact Ubuntu version, you can run grub-install with --root-directory option (if your required partition is mounted to /mnt):
Boot from a live cd like on of your ubuntu install cds and open a Terminal. Now mount one of your ubuntu partitions. Assuming /dev/sda7 is your ubuntu 11.10 partition you can accomplish this by issuing the following command as root user:
Boot from Ubuntu 10.10 ( which u don't want to delete ), Open terminal and type command sudo grub-install /dev/sda . And then sudo reboot . If now grub of Ubuntu 10.10 is there, then you can safely delete partitions of 11.10 and remove the entry of 11.10 from /boot/grub/grub.cfg
