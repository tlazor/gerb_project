If you have more recommendation- or opinion-based questions about what might be useful to look at, maybe drop into our chat room and be ready to tell us what kind of art project you're making.
Yes, of course. The duration it has to run for doesn't make much difference. Your Android smartphone's main GUI is OpenGL, and phones typically have an uptime longer than four weeks. Air Traffic Control centres might use OpenGL SC (the subset of GL for safety-critical applications) continuously for months or years.
If you do have free choice of software, OpenGL is probably not the thing you're concerned about. Artists often use Processing for art projects, because it's simple and lets you get to drawing stuff on the screen with minimal 'boilerplate' code. It's very nice for drawing maths-as-art: particle systems, L-systems, strange attractors, &c. For a 3D scene that's supposed to look like the real world, Unity 3D might be a good choice: it's a game engine that handles all the use of OpenGL or DirectX for you, so you can create the scene you want to draw without much programming.
