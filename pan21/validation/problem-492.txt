As long as this thread seems to be evolving into a (n interesting one) debate about technical details and scientifical opinions concerning state-of-the-art nearly-supreme wireless networking technologies, I would like to give a more simple (yet useful for googlers, I hope) answer for end-users seeking for a practical solution to its WiFi low-speed at home issue.  
And these results were for best conditions with no channel overlapping (most modern routers auto-select channel correctly to avoid this) and near (same room) from the antena device. With this history, we can not be sure that speed results will be different with most modern 802.11ac.
Remember: computer-scientists, as any other engineers, are happy solving problems, so we use to underestimate the headache that the end-user is capable of allow in "configuring the odd thing".
I have deployed multiple wireless systems during years, and I must resume that speakingconcerning to easy-to-install systems (an access point or router to plug and forget), in my tests, when the technology offered:
