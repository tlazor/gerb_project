If you are using a service that requires a CNAME, like Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer, then you cannot point to it with a zone apex or naked domain like "example.com" as CNAMEs cannot be used with naked domains.  This is a restriction of the DNS spec, not something related to cloud or virtualization implementations.

Web sites running on EC2 can be served through zone apex or naked domain like "example.com" with A records.  The fact that the server is running in a virtual machine has no impact on that.  Many sites do this including most of mine.
You can still use Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer with a zone apex or naked domain like "example.com" as long as you host your DNS for that zone using Amazon's Route53 DNS service.  Amazon does tricks to make an A record map dynamically to the results of what the CNAME would have returned, complying with the DNS spec while providing the flexibility and power that ELB needs to provide.
