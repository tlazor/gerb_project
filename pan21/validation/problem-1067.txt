I have a Dell PowerEdge 1850 running Ubuntu in my basement, primarily running a Minecraft server. Leaving it on all the time is a waste of money, and it makes noise at night, so I typically turn it on during the day and turn it off before night, unplugging it when off because the fans run even when shut down.
Currently, however, I can't do this. The BIOS has an option to resume its last state when plugged in, but if I shut down Ubuntu prior to unplugging it, it will not turn on and boot automatically when it is plugged in again, as its last state was having been shut down.
Secondly, since there is "an option to resume its last state when plugged in", isn't there anything to turn it on after power loss ? It's a feature often present on PC's BIOS. There are also other features as "alarm" which turn on the PC at a defined hour, or turn it on pressing a key on the keyboard.
PS : I don't know how minecraft servers work, but using VNC isn't really designed for managing a real server like this, running GNU/Linux. We more often use SSH which is somewhat more convenient, use less bandwith and system resources, and doesn't require a graphical interface.
Is there any way I can have it automatically turn  on, even when I had previously shut down the machine? Alternatively, is there a safe way to kill Ubuntu by unplugging it to simulate the "AC power failure" that the BIOS option is designed for?
Firstly, a computer correctly shutted down shouldn't have any fan running, but it's maybe a specificity of this server, I don't know.
What I want to do is possibly eventually wire a switch, hooked up to the server's power cord, to elsewhere in the house (i.e. near my computer). This way I could simply flip the switch, wait for it to boot, and then VNC into it. When I'm done, I'd stop the Minecraft server, shut Ubuntu down, and flip the switch off again.
Finally, to answer your question, if you want to stop Ubuntu but don't turn of the computer, halt command should do the trick if it exists in Ubuntu. On distribution with systemd, to power off the computer you've to use systemctl poweroff, which will halt the system then power off the machine by ACPI. Using systemctl halt will only halt the system. With that, Ubuntu would be correctly stopped, but not the machine, so if there is a power loss, the last state would be "powered on" and it will boot automatically.
