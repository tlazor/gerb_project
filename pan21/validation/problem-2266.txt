For the last years we've been using a Sonicwall PRO 2040 firewall in a relatively small hosting environment. But we want to upgrade to a faster box which also support IPv6 and preferably we'd like to stay with Sonicwall (as it has served us well over the years) and upgrade to a NSA 2400.
All this time we have run this firewall in so called 'transparent mode'. This way the firewall is completely transparent to the network (i.e. servers) behind the firewall but still the firewall protects the network. Servers that are behind the firewall are configured as if the firewall is not there, e.g. the gateway address is that of a router outside of the firewall. This, in combination with VLAN's (*), allows us to host each server separately from each other in the most transparent way to the customers.
Now that we are moving to a new IP address space and also want to support IPv6 we are rethinking our solution. One reason for that is that transparent mode support for IPv6 seems to be very rare or non-existing at all. So if we want to support IPv6 we have to use routed mode. With this, all kind of questions pop up and hopefully some can help me with some opinions and/or answers.
