You said you tried NETSTAT and there is no port 1433 listening on your server; this means SQL Server Express is NOT accepting TCP/IP connections, so it obviously will not let you connect from other machines; you could then reply "but I can connect locally!"... yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean TCP/IP connections are allowed: when connecting locally, SQL Server can optimize the connections by skipping the TCP/IP part and let the server and the client application (Management Studio) talk directly using shared memory.
By the way, you said you already checked everything... but have you also verified the configuration of Windows Firewall in the VM? Also, have you enabled remote connections to SQL Server Express, which by default doesn't allow them?
First of all, check the IP address of your VM and the IP address of the computer you're trying to connect from; are they on the same network? If not, chances are there is something between you and it which is blocking your connection. Can you connect to the VM using other protocols, like Remote Desktop or Windows file sharing? Can you ping the VM?
A virtual machine is never blocked by whatever firewalling software may be running on the host system; it has its own (virtual) network connection, and that's it: you don't need to open anything on the host system for the VM to talk to the network.
If you find it listening on the port, you'd next need to figure out if there's a software firewall or something configured in the NIC to disallow the connection. If nothing is blocking from there, you may have to triple check that SQL is configured security-wise to allow the connection.
What you should check is how the VM is connected to the network. It may be connected to a dedicated subnet, and you could have a firewall between you and it; or, sine it's running on VMware Server, it may also running on a NATted virtual network, with the host acting as a NAT router between the VM's network and the external one.
It shouldn't have anything to do with being a virtual server unless it's blocked at the host machine.
You don't directly say where you're trying to connect from (your machine, the VM to itself, internet  -> virtual machine...?) but since you said telnet localhost, I'm assuming VM to itself. Use the Netstat command (like netstat -ab might work) to see if the application is listening on that port.
So, you should check that 1) TCP/IP connections are allowed to the server, and 2) that TCP/IP connections from remote machines are allowed. You can verify both settings from the SQL Server Configuration Manager.
