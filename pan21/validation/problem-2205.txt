I've seen examples of both at my local Best Buy... always good for a chuckle. :-)  But you're right in that it sure isn't a good way to sell monitors.
They had a wall full of PC monitors and you could choose which test application you wanted the monitors to show (Excel, Word, video, game, etc.).
Maybe you need glasses? Seriously though, in a store where the controls are accessible, people play with the sharpness, contrast, etc and never put it back. Combine this with sales people that are probably making close to minimum wage and you've got why none were properly calibrated.
Does anyone know why all the display monitors in a store would be fuzzy? Could there have been some kind of interference, e.g. too many monitors on at the same time in too close a proximity? Or does this mean that all (30) of the display monitors are were just bad (which would be hard to believe)?
The odd thing was that ALL of the monitors were fuzzy, even with hard-to-look-at blurry, shadow characters, etc.
Well, my guess is that they hooked them up with VGA cables instead of DVI. Blurry images and shadows are things you usually get from longer cables with analog signals.
