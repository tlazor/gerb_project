I'm not an expert on mysql/mariadb, but I suspect that it is running the sub-query one for every row in CLD_DB.lnmntr, or at least every row it needs to until it finds 500 that match the condition (which might just be 500 or might be far more depending on your data). Some SQL engines are bright enough to see that the inner query is invariant within the context of the current statement and only run it once, but IIRC mariadb's query planner doesn't do that sort of thing.
So it could be either or both of these factors. To confirm which use EXPLAIN to look at the query plan, as suggested by Nick, and edit your question to add the resulting information. It would also be useful to provide the relevant table definitions (columns and their types, and the indexes & keys).
Assuming you have an index on CLD_DB.lnmntr your first query will result in a seek to the first point where lnmntr_ndx >= 18411001 then an ordered partial scan until 500 rows are found (or it hits the end). Even if the inner query were pretty much instantaneous so there would be very little difference between running it once and running it some hundreds or thousands of times, if it needs to be run for each row then you are forcing it to scan down the index from the beginning until 500 rows after the point where lnmntr_ndx is greater than the value.
