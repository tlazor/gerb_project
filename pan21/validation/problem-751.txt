If you want to backup a whole bunch of boxes and have a "CSR proof!" web interface for it all then I'd also recommend reading up on BackupPC which is an excellent tool.
I will chime in and strongly suggest 'backup2l' as a simple solution for creating backups. It'll handle full and incremental backups, and allows you to define your own "ruler" policy. Basic CLI tools support file restore, although the tool uses standard file types like 'tar' (optionally combined with gzip/bzip2) for storage.
rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs (ie. differential backup) are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.
Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted. Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings have sensical defaults.
BackupPc runs on a Linux server and backs up files from Windows, Macs, and PCs.  It can keep multiple full and incremental backups, and gives a browsable web interface to all versions of all files.
rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, modification times, extended attributes, acls, and resource forks.
DAR is like tar on steroids, and among many other things supports indexes. You use the "dar_manager" program to work with the index database.
