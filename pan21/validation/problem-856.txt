You will have to stop replication, make the schema changes and then reestablish replication. Also, since you are running SQL express clients, you will have to run the publisher at the main server instead of the clients. This means you will have to have your publisher push the entire database to the client. You mentioned that there will be updates at both ends. How many updates at a time? If you use any identity column types in your DB, merge replication will manage those for you but it will increase by default 2,000 to the values of your identity. Will you be replicating tables, or everything [stored procecedures,view and UDF's]? It sounds like merge replication would be best since your WAN connection isn't always the best.
I have about 13 databases that I use merge replication in pretty much the same kind of world [also have 95 other databases that I use Merge Replication but those are able to be the publisher at the remote location]. We use SQL Express on the remote locations but the publisher is located here at Corp. Yes, it is a bit messy and it does mess with your identity data types but it does work.
