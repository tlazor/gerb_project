See this article regarding WinSxS folder. It doesn't mention Windows 7, but it is exactly the same reason why you cannot delete it.
My recommendation is to not have this any smaller than 10% of your overall RAM. Keeping in mind however, that ram is not 1000MB but rather 1024MB per GB.
This would indicate to me (if your username is John for example) that your home directory for this user is C:\Users\John and not related to that folder above mentioned.  It is not safe to assume that even if you did this on EVERY USER on your computer and none matched, that it would still be safe to delete, but it gives you a clear indication that no logged on users that you use, make direct use of this folder.
Hibernation.sys is another file that is used when your system needs to transfer everything from the RAM to the hard disk whilst it is in hibernation. The problem with this though, is Windows sometimes has trouble getting out of hibernation mode and resumes operation. You did not mention this file, but for anyone else reading, to disable this problem (especially with laptops) open the Command Prompt by right-clicking on it and selecting "Run As Administrator" then type:
Try to not delete this folder. Maybe uninstall applications you don't need. This is where applications will store files for each user that have access to those applications.
C:/users/public/L001 - 40.7 gb <- this concerns me as to ask this it generally would indicate that you are unsure of the user that this folder concerns.
Mostly, it is used as a swap, when your system needs to swap-in or swap-out data from the RAM (which is where the data is stored by the application/s running) and then put the data for application which might be minimised for a long time or put into the background as you run other applications.
If you were going to install Microsoft Outlook and you and your partner had each their own account, in this directory on his/her account would be the profiles and settings for Microsoft Outlook which is how you can keep your own settings in each application separate.
All folders in C:\Users\Public are considered "public" folders, meaning they can or have been used as a central place to put files between users on the computer, or across a network. This article doesn't say much, but it will give you a very brief overview. I would just look into it, if you're sure it's all crap, just delete it.
C:\pagefile.sys is created by Windows usually in direct correlation to your RAM installed. It is used by the system to keep a copy of what is in RAM if the computer needs to transfer it immediately to a file. Thus, if you had 12GB of RAM installed, you can usually expect the pagefile to be around the 12GB mark.
If you think you don't need it, you can disable it here too. If you launch a few applications simultaneously or run a resource intensive game, you might get an "Out Of Memory" error. If this is the case, just increase the file size and restart.
So, for each GB on your system, multiply this by 1024.  If you have a 4GB system, you would use 10% like this:
I am going to assume you use Windows 7 from having this folder. It requires a technical explanation that is not only unnecessary, but better done by the experts. In short - DO NOT DELETE THIS.
As for the pagefile.sysyou can generally make it smaller, but not remove it all together. If you are concerned with this file, follow the following steps. I would however advise you to be careful in doing this, as it may affect the overall performance of your computer!
