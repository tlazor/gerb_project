It is possible that the USB port you are using is damaged so the easiest thing to do is to try several other ports. I would also try reinstalling the pendrives drivers or try it with another computer to see if that's the problem. If that's not it then it may be time to try to open the pendrives case and see if there isn't something you can fix or spend some money on a new pendrive. Perhaps check warranty and maybe research your pendrives model to see if there's similar issues.
Seems like the pendrive itself is damaged. This could be some static electricity inside the pendrive or the usb connector itself was twisted and caused for a loose connection internally.
Keep in mind that temperature changes the shape of metal (metal expands when becoming hot) and the inside of a pendrive will warm up, which can cause for an already loose connection to become disconnected for a split second.
I have seen USB ports on some laptops that have sensitive connections. If the plug is jostled or wiggled it can often interrupt the connection. Best rule for me is: plug the USB drive in and don't touch the plug or move the cable till the job is done.
