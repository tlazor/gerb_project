I am able to go to the command terminal (wrong term? It’s the text screen to enter code) and I have learned how to view the desktop content as text. It’s all there as far as I can tell by reading file names.
On Linux, the login screen is operated by the "display manager." By default on Mint, the display manager is their own, MDM (Mint display manager). Upon logging in successfully, it starts an X11 session for your user, which reads all of its default locations to learn what window manager and other tools to run. For example, Mint's main release runs Cinnamon (the binary is named cinnamon-session) which runs a window manager muffin but just stick to cinnamon-session which should start everything it needs to. Cinnamon starts all the components including the desktop with icons and wallpaper, and the panel (people coming from Windows will call it a "task bar" but that's only one component on a panel).
There are other ones like KDE and GNOME, but I don't actually know those binary names but I think Mint doesn't provide those by default but you hopefully recognize which term is used and be able to research further.
If you happen to know that you picked one of the other Mint releases such as Mint MATE, you would need to run a different window manager. Options could include:
I can see the login screen with the box to verify my username and type in the password. But once I do that, I’m brought to the GUI screen with nothing visible except the mouse cursor. I can move it around but there’s nothing to see or click, just a black screen.
The fact that you can move the mouse, but see nothing else, means that X11 started for your user, but that any window manager or additional session programs have failed to start. So for a quick and dirty hack to get you running something on the display:
Now, if cinnamon-session fails to start, you could perhaps try running a specific program on the graphical terminal from the text console. The Cinnamon file manager is named nemo. So DISPLAY=:0 nemo
I am running Mint on my laptop (an old Dell). I had no issues until I downloaded Zoom yesterday. Now there’s a problem.
check your /var/log/syslog for any obvious error messages. Also, this is probably related to your graphics card driver, try updating it. If that doesn't help check your cinnamon version, it might need updating.
