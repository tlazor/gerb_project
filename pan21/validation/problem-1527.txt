You'll probably save yourself a whole lot of pain and wasted time by doing a re-install. You can most likely buy a USB DVD drive or boot from USB key - either way, you'll have to obtain the OS media somewhere. 
If you really don't want to go down that road, you could start with installing malwarebytes (malwarebytes.org) and see if it can sort out some of your issues. You can download a copy to a usb key on another machine and then install it. I recommend running this once and getting latest updates. Then boot into safe mode and rerun it until it shows up clear. 
Create a bootable USB from one of the rescue disks out there such as this one (includes clamav antivrus) and scan your netbook offline.
Well... You could run a full scan with Avast, Ad-Aware and Spybot. If you have a Windows 7 license I'd suggest you format and install W7 from a USB drive instead (just drag and drop the setup files from a W7 dvd to a bootable usb-drive/stick). Installing XP from USB is a bit more finicky, but also an option
