It is possible that permissions can be changed so remove Administrator read/write access to files/folders, also preventing changing the permissions by the admin.  However, the Administrator can still take ownership of the files, which enables access to change permissions.  Then, add access to Administrators.
Is there a way to access the c$ share of a server from another computer and gain complete access regardless of the file system privileges?  Perhaps the 'system' account can do this, can I access this account?  Also, for my purposes, I need to keep this system live, so I can't just mount the file system on Linux or anything like that (other than mounting the c$ share)
If you are an administrator, once you have accessed the c$ share you can take ownership of those folders and then change the permissions to allow yourself access.
Right now, My tape backup drive is not working.  Until this is fixed, there is a windows file sharing server that I want to manually backup to an array.  This server can't have the array directly attached to it.  I can either access the computer with the array shared from the file server, or the other way around.  
However, when I try to just copy the files from the file sharing host I get a can't copy file error that causes the copy to abort.  The reason, I think, is that administrator does not have privileges to access the shares right now.  Even though the administrator account can grant this access, I would rather not mess with the privileges.     
You can grant a user account Backup Privileges, which allows it access to all files regardless of other permissions on those files.
