I would also think that years of this going on has caused the various component makers and the notebook OEMs to sit down and hammer out better interoperability guidelines so that the components (and drivers) work best "as-is", without modification.
My guess would be that OEMs don't actually like investing in the resources required to keep customized drivers up-to-date for various components for many different models.  Since users keep computers for much longer than the OEM actively supports, over the years I have seen lots of complaints about how the OEM "refuses to" update their required custom drivers to support new feature/fix implemented by the manufacturer in the baseline driver, or to support new operating system versions, etc. Leading to unhappy customers.
Again, it's hard to say WHY things have changed recently, and I can't even say for sure that it has, or if it just seems like it.  
So it's easier and cheaper for them to just use the product within the baseline specs, with the common/baseline driver.  They then don't need to bare the full responsibility for supporting the component's driver (if the manufacturer supplies one) and they also don't have to invest on-going resources into keeping it in-line with changes to the baseline driver, or update it to be compatible with newer OSs.
Another reason was because often the OEMs buy the components from a manufacturer that doesn't provide end-user sales or support (at all, or for that model of the component).  So to use the component, the computer OEM had to take on the role of distributing the driver and providing support.
The (primary) reason they originally made you go to the OEM for certain drivers (usually video drivers) is because the OEMs would often implement the component in a specific way that worked (best) with their machine, and this often called for the OEM to modify the manufacturer's baseline driver.
Yup, but really only if you're having problems.  Whenever I build new computers or reinstall the OS from scratch (personally or when I worked for an OEM) I always use the latest versions of the drivers from the manufacturers.
Get the latest ones offered for you specific model from the OEM, and then look for newer versions from the actual component's manufacturer.
