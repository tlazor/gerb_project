I highly recommend reading Mark Cox's blog entries on RH security. He's the lead of their security response team, and the metrics he puts together are very interesting. (If anyone knows of anything comparable from another distro — or from any other company! — I'd love to know about it.)
Also there is "Hardened Gentoo". Some research I read some time ago (sorry, cannot find it now) mentioned that it implements more security technologies in its core than Ubuntu/CentOS/Debian.
I am not new to server-hardening, my packages are up to date I read Ubuntu Security Notices and I have no unneeded services installed on my server.
I have a root-server (i7/24GB/1TB) running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS as my OS. After some security audits (OpenVAS, Retina etc) I see that Ubuntu isn't the most secure system for a semi-corporate environment. Its updated from many sources, ofc from the Ubuntu security repo too.
All of the big-name distros are actually quite good. However, Red Hat directly employs the largest security team — and employs the most direct contributors to the projects likely to be at risk. I don't mean at all to downplay the contributions of dedicated volunteers and of hard-working smaller teams, but Red Hat's dedication of resources to security is part of what makes theirs legitimately an enterprise Linux distribution.
What distro is secure and up to date from your point of view? How can I make the server more secure? Outsourcing of every software-module to a VM?
Both Canonical and RedHat provide extra services for a fee. Among these are timelier updates and a focus on security.
