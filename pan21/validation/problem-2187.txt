So erased NAND is faster than overwriting existing data on NAND, and SSD firmware does a lot of sleight-of-hand behind the scenes to try to write to erased parts of NAND before doing erase-then-write cycles which are slower.  Therefore, generally, a larger capacity drive is going to have more erased NAND available for new writes, so it will be able to work faster for longer.
Larger drives will take longer to fill up so they can handle more writes before being forced to perform erases in order to overwrite existing data.
Simplifying this a bit: SSDs rely on NAND - and the blocks on NAND have to be erased before they can be overwritten - but if they are already erased or unwritten, that time-consuming step isn't needed.  
Of course there is TRIM which does allow the OS to tell the SSD that it can erase blocks and keep the drive fast.  Older SSDs without TRIM would certainly get slower the longer they are used (and a higher capacity would delay this) because the SSD is never erasing any NAND.
I would say given the same SSD controller and firmware version, because of this, the speed will depend on the percent capacity of space that is used on the drive.
the mechanical drive has to walk through the sectors 3 times in order to retrieve the info. The electronic drive, in other hand, reads all data at once. Because of this the SSDs speed increases with its storage capacity.
