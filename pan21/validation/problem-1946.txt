As a general rule Pure are also very supportive of their customers, you could always reach out to them to see if they have a test harness already built that might help you figure out the information you want.
CrystalDiskMark is not really a good measure of storage performance with arrays, like Pure Storage. They write frequently about different testing methodologies on their blog. You would be better off using DiskSpd for a synthetic workload right now, although you would want to use something like distributed relay to get a true test of how things perform.
Is this expected for a FlashArray config or can it be configured at the controller or LUN level to be more optimal for reads than writes? The host will host a data warehouse with tables already in the 250 GB+ range.
I'm running time trials on a new Windows 2012 Server host with PureStorage FlashArray SSD LUNs attached. I conduct an initial test with CrystalDiskMark and discover write performance is substantially better than read performance.
This is an old question bumped to the front page, so the MattyZDBA has probably resolved the issue by now, but for future readers:
