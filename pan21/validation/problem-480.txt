Some distribs are allowed however, like Ubuntu Could for Azure, AWS, Oracle, or IBM clouds. I don't know any "desktop" distrib of Linux that correctly boots in UEFI secure mode. But UEFI itself does work (as it notably allows installations with disks over 4TB)
Linux perfectly boots in UEFI now (see "man efibootmgr" and "man bootctl"), but yes the secure mode is limited to just a few distributions that sign their files with certificates compatible with your UEFI BIOS (also this depends on the presence or absence of a TPM module: beware that some motherboards have UEFI BIOS compatible with secure boot, but the TPM module is actually not installed, you just have a header and you need to buy and install a TPM module on this header; Windows however works in UEFI secure boot because the UEDI BIOS already contains the certificates needed for Windows).
Only some professional distribs of Linux for servers are working on motherboards preequipped with a TPM module and a compatible BIOS featured with the certificates needed to start these distribs; and getting signed Linux distribs is quite complicate (and often requires subscribing a support); basically these Linux distribs are used to run hypervisors on which you'll install VMs of your choice (using a virtual TPM module provided by the hypervisor).
