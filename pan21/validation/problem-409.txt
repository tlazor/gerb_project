I think the advise from the ISP must be right particularly as they provided the router  misinformation would be costly to them if only in customer disatisfaction.
If you turn your modem off, the ISP thinks that it is not working correctly (or the line cannot handle such a high speed as what it is supposedly connected at) when it checks the line, and, to make it run better, turns the speed down.
As for turning an electronic device on and off, they can experience thermal stress on the components, but most devices are rather robust these days.
(Some?) ISPs keep checking with all the modems to which they are connected to make sure the connection is running at "optimum speed".
I always turned my router off when not in use but following speed problems I have recently been advised by my ISP  to leave the router on 24/7. I haven't noticed any significant warming when touching the router (5days now) I have run a speed test at regular intervals ( slight ups and downs) nothing to panic about.
I'm not sure why your service was slow, but it's possible that not having the router on all the time to talk to the service provider caused an error on their side.
Problems are caused on the modem level when it over heats, you can solve the entire problem of this just by ensuring good ventilation of the device. The only other problem it is prone to is capacitors 'frying' (they actually harden), which is quite common as they are only rated for n hours. If you keep the device cool you will maximize it's life. No, turning it off won't do anything other than maybe let the caps run for a longer time... but if you keep them in a warm place, they're hardening anyway.
"My cable modem uses 7 watts, my D-Link DI-604 router uses 4.5 watts, and my Motorola phone box for use with Vonage uses 2 watts while idle (3 when I'm on the phone)." Link
Problems can happen "down the line" meaning your phone line between you and the ISP can get messed up (again, they're only rated for so long, then they degrade and get replaced). This is also common.
I would say leave it on. Routers don't use up much power. They use less than 1/10th of the power a typical computer uses while it's running. It doesn't amount to much.
Overall, I'd say you'd better off leaving your router on. According to online reviews (I sifted through 50+), most people have better luck leaving their routers on. Though I only saw a handful of complaints about turning it off everyday.
