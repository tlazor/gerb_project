Have a look at connrate in iptables(8) manpage. You can match the connection rate and slow down a connection that has uploading too fast by either putting it into an appropriate tc class or drop or tarpit or whatever works for you.
I have to agree with alex in that you're probably going to need some sort of traffic shaper, what you want to look at is packets per second as an interactive shell is going to have a significantly smaller value than a modest file transfer.
We have a Linux server acting as a router/firewall for our office. Occasionally someone will upload a large file that takes up all our bandwidth. I don't want to implement any complex rules or traffic shaping, but I'm wondering if there is a way to slow down a single connection on the spot? I found tcpnice, but it doesn't slow down the transfers in my testing.
The one issue I have with your request is that it seems that you want to start limiting the transfer rate of an already established connection which is going to be quite difficult to do as everything I can think of is going to want to start operating on a new connection, and will leave existing connections going.
Have you thought of setting up a reverse Squid proxy and setting up delay-pools?  You could also do this with the limit directive of iptables.
