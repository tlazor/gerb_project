Basically what I would need is some type of Macro software that can record the actions in multiple applications on the same computer. First access an array that will be predefined with the cities we are interested in, copy the city, got to the Atom.io project, Cntrl+F the last city and replace it with the new one, hit Cntrl + S to save, head to the hosting GUI and create a new domain equal to the particular service we offer + the city. Tab his way to the create button and then, search the domain and open it in order to upload the files. Then go to the SSL tab in chrome, get to the bottom of the page and enter the new domain in the SSL certificate list. And repeat till the end of the city_array.
But that's releasing 70 sites by doing the same thing over and over again - copy the next city, paste it instead of the last, save it, create the domain, upload the files and register it for SSL.
So a part of my day-to-day tasks is releasing little 2-page sites that all link to one main site and are optimised for different cities. Point being we want to catch the people who are looking for our service in their own town.
It uses a combination Python and on-screen elements to create automated scripts. E.g. You can create a script that says "when this button appears on screen [select screen area], click it".
I think this should be automated. I tried using UOPilot but it was quite buggy and didn't really work out for me.
I think I tried AutoHotkey as well but I didnt manage to get it to work... So anyone got any ideas on a software that can handle this ?
