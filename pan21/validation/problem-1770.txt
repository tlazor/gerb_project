so, you would have to configure the .bashrc on the server to check an existing PS1 (or whatever variable) and only set PS1 if it is not set already.
you can specify environment variables on the client side and if the ssh-server allows it (check man sshd-config), these variables are copied to the session when you log into the machine.
or, which make things simpler, you bundle your settings into a function .. and deploy that function either as a special file your source on demand (source joes_bashrc) or directly to the .bashrc. having your own file seems a bit more robust. the other folks might use your settings but are not forced to do so.
Put your PS1 prompt in ~/.ssh/environment and ssh session will carry it to every host you login. It works for me with openssh 4.3p2 .
ssh -t srvname ' cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.n &>/dev/null ; echo "LS_COLORS=\"no=00:fi=00:ETC:ETC:ETC\";" >> ~/.bashrc.n ; echo "export LS_COLORS" >> ~/.bashrc.n ; echo "alias ls=\"ls --color=auto\";" >> ~/.bashrc.n ; exec bash --rcfile ~/.bashrc.n'
