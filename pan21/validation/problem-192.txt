1) Gist (for those that just want to see the premise or implement their own alternating solution, edge cases not covered).
Some things that are still different cmd + right and cmd + left don't act the same, on Linux I use alt+page-up and down. 
Oh, and guake has a configurable copy and paste setting for the terminal, so I set that to be alt+c and alt+p for terminal shenanigans
Another thing that might help with the copy and paste functions in Linux is to use the middle mouse button to paste. When you highlight some text, you don't have to copy it - highlight it, switch to your other app, then click the middle mouse button to paste the highlighted text. Different habits would make the keyboard issue a moot point, at least for those specific functions.
2) The full on installer that makes use of systemd, bash, and xprop. (Edge cases, like chromebooks are covered, it was surprisingly difficult to support, but I enjoy mine so everyone can benefit!)
Here's a much a simpler solution, Kinto. It tackles the very issue you're having with terminal keymaps not working right while keeping a good keymap with everything else.
And talking about Wayland I do have a proof of concept of how to make this keymap keyswap trick work on KDE Plasma 5 with an existing widget that pulls in app names. If anyone has a better solution then I am all ears, especially if it can work on x11 as well. Xprop is completely sufficient on x11, but obviously no use on Wayland.
Essentially, with this solution you're not fighting how to properly create new shortcut keys or trying to avoid shortcut conflicts in your Terminal apps vs the rest of your GUI apps. You simply get the best of both words, and it works as seamlessly as it can - beyond including default shortcut config files for various terminals and popular text editors, which I may include later. Even text editors like Sublime don't simply swap out the Cmd key with Ctrl on every shortcut, but it aligns properly about 95% or more of the time I'd say.
I ended up depending on vim bindings in my editor to keep me sane, I would recommend that if it's possible for what you're doing.
I've been working on this for 3 years now.. and finally feel like I can contribute something back because of how well it works, unlike my last 2 attempts. It is intended for x11, and systemd based distros, but the concept will carry over to Wayland once I find a good way to implement it, despite the enhance security that makes it difficult to work with.
KDE (Kubuntu) has a shortcut config tool that lets you set global shortcuts, but I couldn't get it to recognize the changes when I tested it. Perhaps it needs a restart. Maybe Ubuntu has a similar option.
I went through this a while ago and found someones autokey setup (I would give credit if I could find where it came from).
