If you know Microsoft Developer Tools, you can use PSAPI (Process status API) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684884(VS.85).aspx to write nifty utility to do the things you want.
But I wonder. Is it your own laptop, or a company laptop. If the latter, then it might be something configured in the group policy that installs the programs again.
Is there a program or utility to monitor the running process and automatically kill specific processes?  My work laptop has a whole bunch of useless crap that I cannot uninstall.  Some of these processes keeps popping a specific intervals and consume tons of cpu and make my laptop useless.  I always have to manually kill these processes which is annoying.  I can't uninstall these otherwise they will automatically reinstall.
Try attaching a debugger to the process and break.  It shouldn't pop up anymore (since it's still running), but it shouldn't bother you anymore either (from the break).  Apparently one of my co-workers used to do this to avoid automatic reboots after installing updates.
