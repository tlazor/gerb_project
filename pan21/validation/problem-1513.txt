At work, we have decided to finally virtualize and have decided to upgrade out SAN setup with higher capacity Hard Drives. However, what exactly is the difference between Hard Drives that come packaged with a SAN set up, or going to New Egg and picking up a bunch of 1 TB hard drives? 
Beyond that, even when two disks have identical entries for the above spec, the drives that come in a SAN will probably be certified/warranted for 24hr continuous operation, and may also include custom firmware from the SAN manufacturer. 
I ask because the quote we received for a new SAN set up with 12 TB (6 TB usable) capacity was $15,000 which seems INSANELY high, especially since I could go to New Egg and pick up 12 TB hard drives for ~$1,500. 
The main reason is that these expensive SAN hard drives comes into a case with a chip and a firmware into it. Also, the chip detects automatically if the hard drive must be replaced and allows the hard drive to be hot swappable.
A SAN is exactly that, a Storage Area Network. This usually includes not just the hard drives themselves, but a chassis, (motherboard etc) and software. SAN's can be expensive, but they usually provide much faster throughput than a single hard drive. Whether or not you need one of these is a totally different matter.
As for the price difference - if you're buying a decent (or even semi-decent SAN) you are buying a lot more than a bunch of hard disks - the drives may only be a relatively small part of the cost.
