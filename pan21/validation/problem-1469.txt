So in one line per drive you have sdX device name, size, model, s/n and the pci and ata numbers. The sdc above coresponds to a USB SD card reader with no card inserted. Hence the ---- in place of real information.  
The ${x} in host${x} refers to that first number in the [0:0:0:0]. So for me ata1 refers to host0 which can also be represented in SCSI form as 0:*:
Depending on your system, it might be divined by wandering around sysfs.  On my system ls -l /sys/dev/block reveals that 8:0 (major:minor from /dev entry) points to /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/host0/target0:0:0/0:0:0:0/block/sda  Likewise, ls -l /sys/class/ata_port reveals that ata1 points to /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/ata1/ata_port/ata1 which is on the same PCI sub-device.
The easiest way is to review the kernel log from boot, since the drive device names are mixed in from various sources (eg USB drives), or are assigned based on type of device (ie cdrom may be scdX instead, and everything has a sgX).  In practice, unless you have mixed different kinds of buses (eg SATA+USB) the lowest numbered ata device is going to be sda unless it's a cdrom device.
When a Linux box gets an ATA error, it syslogs it with a message identifying the disk as "ata%d.00". How do I translate that to a device name (e.g. /dev/sdb)? I feel like this should be trivial, but I cannot figure it out.
Since I use SATA, and only one drive is on each port I can deduce that ata1.00 = sda.  All of my drives are .00, I suspect that if I used a port multiplier, my drives would be given .01, .02, .03 etc.  Looking at other people's logs PATA controllers use .00 and .01 for master and slave, and based on their logs if you have ataX.01, the .01 should be mapped to the "ID" in the host:channel:ID:LUN folder from the /sys/dev/block/ listing. If you have multiple ataX/ and hostY/ folders in the same PCI device folder, then I suspect that the lowest numbered ataX folder matches the lowest numbered hostY folder.
