However, to answer your original question, permissions for DOM storage are essentially the same as for cookies.  Certain permissions, such as 3rd party, do not apply, but the settings to deny cookies or restrict them to the current session are also applied to DOM storage.  Unfortunately Firefox will not show you whether a web page is using DOM storage or not so it can be difficult to verify.  Hence the addon is useful.
I am the developer of the Cookie Controller addon, and it will show you the permissions that apply to local storage (and session storage) as well as letting you set those permissions.
Lastly, there is a limit on the amount of storage that can be used by each web page.  By default this is 5MB but you can change it, potentially to zero.  However, web pages don't always handle overflowing this quota very well so you might cause problems by changing it.
There is also a hidden preference that will completely disable all DOM storage independently of cookies: dom.storage.enabled.  This is a little brutal and usually you would just block cookies to block storage.  Equally, exceptions set to allow individual web sites to set cookies also allow them to use DOM storage.
