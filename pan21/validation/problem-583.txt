Doing things in that way can be beneficial as it means the routing tables are smaller, using less memory on your routers.
Just by changing the third octet does not mean that each IP address is in a different subnet - the subnet for each individual host matters!  So if each of your IP videocameras had subnets of 255.255.255.0, they would all be on different subnets, and require routing (not necesarily separate routers) to talk to other subnets, including the "parent" one.  However, you could create a route to all of them using the 10.10.0.0/255.255.0.0 subnet, if that was appropriate.
It might be wiser to create smaller subnets, as I doubt you'll ever actually be deploying the 65,534 possible hosts you could have on the 10.10.0.0/255.255.0.0 subnet.  Getting subnet design right before you start deploying anything is a good idea - once things are out there in large numbers it is a bigger task to fix mistakes!
However, it can also be confusing to inexperienced network admins - there seem to be plenty around that don't really understand subnets.
