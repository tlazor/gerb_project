I would use screen in this situation. Start a screen session, then attach to it on both the console and on the remote machine.
I have some plans for this utility, it's usefulness is growing as I play with it.  I'm planning on forwarding the mouse events too, so really you could use keyboard & mouse on a remote computer (not just RPi!), great for demonstrations and show&tell type things.  
I want to be able to see characters I send and then have them accepted as if a keyboard was attached.
I understand that it is a security risk to be able to write characters to the login shell, but how can I do it?
Couldn't you just print the command to tty1, and then run the command from ssh, and forward the output to tty1. 
if I ssh in to my Pi that has a tv attached to the svideo I can set tty1 writable but it does not seem to "see" the input, the characters just appear on the screen.
Effectively, it connects your keyboard directly to the RPi, as if you were typing on a USB keyboard plugged into the RPi.  Certainly interesting to type on my laptop, and see the output on the bigscreen, as if I were typing on the RPi itself.
That way the end result would be about the same. Except maybe missing the pi@raspberrypi ~ $ in front on the command, but you could just fake that by also printing that. 
Is it just a getty security "thing"? If I set up automated login would I be able to execute "ls" etc directly on tty1?
I had a need for this exact situation, so I wrote a program for it.  Using uinput, I forward my ssh connection to the console keyboard (and soon, console mouse too!).
