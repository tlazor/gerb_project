where SambaServer is the name of the host runnign the Samba server, Share1 is the name of the partition to be shared on it, ~/mnt/S1 is the directory where I want to mount the shared folder and mysername is my username on the Samba server machine.
I also have some partition being shared with samba. The samba server is on a Debina machine running Unstable. I have noticed that I need to have the shared directories owned by the smbuser group.
My guess would be permissions on the directory itself.  Nine times out of ten I forget to change these permissions.
I have to assume that it is an issue on the Fedora side of things because accessing the share from Windows works fine.  I have also tried mounting via SSHFS with no luck; it also will allow me to read files but not write.  However, in Windows, using a program called WebDrive I am able to access the files (essentially via SSHFS) with no issues whatsoever.
I have tried setting up NFS but not much luck there either; I'd rather just stick with Samba if possible.
I have a Debian server sharing files via Samba.  I can access the files via Windows with no problems whatsoever, but when I try to mount the share on a Fedora client using the same credentials I am unable to write to any files.  I have proper read access, but no write permissions.
