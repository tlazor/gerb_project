The same as with any other server. Again, blades are not anything else than a different physical packaging of servers. Use the normal technologies that you know as a professional admin and just ignore that they come in a special form factor.
THe CHassis itself will rarely fail - I use a Dell 1000e myself ans seriously, all active components are redundant (6 power supplies, 2 chassis controllers, 9 Fans). What can fail is the KVM master module and the backplane. I dont care about the KVM (does not stop blades from working) and the backplane has no active elements.... so it is unlikely to just fail.
Yes, it is possible - shared memory between computers as single instance image exists. It is not feasible, though, and a nieche technology, mostly limited to special very rare Hypervisor-Scenarios. Generally "plan your servers as you need them" is the solution.
If you want to research such technology, start at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_system_image - there is also a list of software as a starting point. Again - this normally makes little sense. Do not even start thinking unless you have a Infiniband QDR backplane.
Replace "Blade" with "Server" and you get the answer. Blades are independent servers. Standard technologies do not become invalid just because you pack them dense into a blade center.
