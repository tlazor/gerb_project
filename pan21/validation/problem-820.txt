My Acer C720 suddenly decided my in-room router was 'out of range', after two years of operation. My phone and tablet connect without problem. The Chromebook can see every neighbor's wifi, just not mine. Running Wifi Analyzer shows no other wifis on the same channel. My wifi signal is -59dB, 1000 times stronger than the next strongest (on a different channel).
A few months ago I picked up a Samsung chromebook from a pawnshop for cheap and I just use it for things most people use a tablet for. Most of the time its just plugged in to my speakers in the basement so I can listen to music whenever I'm down there. 
None of the methods suggested on many web pages worked. Particularly unhelpful is the many guessers calling to 'restart your router' when your other devices are connecting flawlessly.
Anyways its worked fine up until about last week, when one night it could no longer connect to my wifi network. I passed it off as just a wifi issue and thought nothing of it. Trying again in the subsequent days it still would not work, claiming that my network is out of range(its not, as I've placed it next to the wireless modem to the same result). When I try to connect to my network it seems to be working fine but the chromebook seems to keep losing and regaining connections for example when I go to connect to a network it'll show other networks in my neighbourhood and mine but the list constantly changes almost as if I took it out of range and back in. 
After two connectionless weeks going through every conceivable option, what finally worked for me was to do a real shutdown:
I would say your best bet would be to restore your chromebook and if that resolves the issue. If not, crack it open and check if the antennas disconnected from the wifi card.
Probably removing the battery would have the same effect. On a C720 that would entail taking the back off.
Anyways I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar issue with Samsung chromebooks, or chromeOS in general. I'll post the product name/number of my chromebook later, as I'm not at home currently.
