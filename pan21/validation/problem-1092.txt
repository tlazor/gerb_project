NOTE: 0.64 (current "stable" as of 2015-06-25) may not work, you need >=0.65. Check the prerelease or development builds.
I tried a few things. i disabled the ati display device driver desktop management and grid management. this didn't make a difference. I quit the aquasnap pro windows grid manager. This didn't make any difference. With the desktop manager (Hydravision Multiple Desktops option) I noticed some odd things like I could launch putty on one desktop and then it would appear on a different desktop. For example, I'd launch it on desktop 1 and then it would be visible on desktop 2 but not desktop 1.
The only true fix for this is to update to the latest version of PuTTY (>=0.65) from the main PuTTY website. 
The reason for this problem is in how PuTTY was incorrectly setting up and showing it's window, it worked more by accident than design and the "bug" that made it actually show up at all was fixed by a recent Windows Update.  This meant the bug no longer worked and the PuTTy window no longer showed up properly.
In the end, I disabled windows aero from Control Panel\Personalization. If you are using windows aero Window Color and Appearance will give you the option to "open classic appearance properties". Select that and then select windows vista basic as the colour scheme. Click apply and putty window is visible again. Hope this helps someone.
