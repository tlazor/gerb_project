Create another user on your system.  Try sudo with that user, if the user can sudo you need to remove the user from the admin group to disable that user from running sudo.
Instead of trying to find technical ways to sabotage your own computer's Internet access, maybe you should try to stop procrastinating. First; stop posting here with questions that don't belong (which you'll find will already save you some time), second; stop fighting yourself. It won't work. Just work on your paper and try to restrain yourself from clicking a a browser icon until it's done. If that STILL doesn't work, create a new user account WITHOUT admin privileges and DELETE your admin (root) account. That should stop you from getting online, and prevent you from installing any new packages until you find an Ubuntu install disk, boot off of that, then start procrastinating again.
Once you've done that, you need to stop yourself from using your regular sudo-enabled account when at the library.  So change your password to a long complex one that you can't memorize.  Find a large book that you're not likely to carry with you, pick a page, and string together the first letter of each line reading down the page to build your password.  Write down the page number, but not the long password.
Let the system automatically log you in and set a password with copy & paste, after you have removed the network manager. If you can't remember the password you are not able to install anything. As long as you have no rescue cd at hand you have successfully destroyed your internet. You could even copy the password in a file and remove the right to read it. Thus you can use a rescue cd later on to get back the access to your system.  
Does your laptop have a removable modem/lan modal? If so, remove it and leave it at home. But I suspect you'll always be able to find other ways to waste time, so getting a backbone is probably the best solution.
As long as you leave the book behind, you'll be stuck with the lower-privileged user when you're at the library and won't be able to sudo until you go back home and look in the book.
