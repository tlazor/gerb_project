I had only 900MB of free space on my C drive and wanted to get rid of the hiberfil.sys file, which took more than 6GB. So I removed it with powercfg -h. But it just kept coming back after about 10 seconds or something. I think it has something to do with PointSec because that was mentioned earlier here.
Find the file %programfiles%\VMware\VMware Tools\plugins\vmsvc\disableGuestHibernate.dll delete it or move it.
Then I disabled hibernation, and then quickly copied a 1GB file over to the C drive. Now it doesn't come back and I have still 6GB of space left. I guess it's still trying to enable hibernation and finds that there is no longer enough space for that. And next time I run out of space on the C drive, I can still delete the 1GB file..
Finally, disable hibernation once and for all by opening an administrator elevated command prompts and running:
out of frustration, I even configured the local policy such that it would run a cmd on machine startup that would run the powercfg line, but even that's not good enough!
The disableGuestHibernate plugin loads when vmware tools loads.  If vmware tools loads while running in a vm, it will disable hibernation (since vmware has its own suspend system making hibernation redundant.)  But if vmware tools loads outside of a vm (i.e. you use boot camp to boot into windows instead) it will re-enable hibernation if its disabled.
