You might be thinking of NetBIOS "workgroup" names, which do need to match in order for network discovery to work. The workgroup name can be configured in Control Panel â†’ System.
Just to clarify one thing: Without HomeGroup, there is no HomeGroup-like "network" that hosts must explicitly join or leave in order to communicate. The network name that you describe is simply for display purposes.
As an aside, automatic discovery is not strictly required for sharing files; it just adds convenience features. My suggestion would be to troubleshoot this incrementally:
(I'm not sure whether this affects the newer WS-Discovery protocol in any way. I believe it simply works according to IP subnet boundaries, and "sees" all computers within the same subnet. Modern Windows versions run both protocols side-by-side, or in fact disable NetBIOS completely due to its SMBv1 dependency, so I'm actually surprised the workgroup name is still an issue.)
The network detection is used by Windows to automatically switch between "Public" and "Private" modes of the firewall, depending on the location. But it doesn't affect anything else. As long as both computers' firewall mode permits file sharing, it doesn't matter whether the names match or not.
The "IP subnet" part shouldn't be overlooked. Both discovery protocols work using multicast, so if you have "stacked routers" (each creating its own subnet), the discovery packets won't be able to reach from one subnet to another.
