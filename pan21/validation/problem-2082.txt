Sometimes, it's a bit of a bother to have to reboot the computer, so I'm looking for a way to resolve the problem that doesn't involve a reboot. I've tried to close and restart the Windows Fax and Scan application, but that doesn't solve the problem. I've also tried to disconnect from, and reconnect to, the WiFi, but that also doesn't help.
If there's some Windows service or other kind of daemon I could restart, I'd consider that an improvement over rebooting, but I haven't been able to figure out which one to target.
This happens even though the scanner is, in fact, powered on, and, according to its own little display, connected to the WiFi.
Occasionally, however, it stops working. When I try to scan something, I get this error message from Windows Fax and Scan:
Is there a (fairly) easy way to 'reset' Windows 10 scan and printing so that it discovers that the scanner is, in fact, online?
If I reboot my Windows 10 laptop, it works again, so I'd suspect that the problem is in Windows, and not with the printer.
I have a WiFi-connected printer and scanner (Canon MG 5700) that I use from Windows 10. One of the nice features of Windows 10 is that I never had to install any drivers or bloatware to get it working. Windows automatically discovered the printer on the network, and it actually works.
