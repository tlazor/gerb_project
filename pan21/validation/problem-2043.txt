I think it is better choice to have  of purchase_id as FK in SALE_ITEM table in oppose to product_id, because sell is something related to PURCHASE and PRODUCT both and this option offer you this relation,  you can get the corresponding product_id and information related to PRODUCT by making a join in sql query.
Suppose there is an item in stock that costs $ 100 (product cost, not the selling price), but there are only 3 pieces to sell, then the customer decides to buy another batch of the same product, but this time the lot comes to a different price, $ 76 for example.
Don't add restrictions with your design, let them give flexibility to choose the way they want to. Even this part can be handled with sql query incase needed.
So, should I relate the sale of each product with the identifier of the table PURCHASE instead of the identifier in PRODUCT table?
The purchase cost is very important, because on it the percentage of profit is calculated, so if the cost is different, the selling price will be different too.
