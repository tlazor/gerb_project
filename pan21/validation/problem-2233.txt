Also, be careful about using the cpu_count column to get a core count. If hyperthreading is enabled, this column seems to reflect the number of logical processors exposed. Generally speaking, you don't want DOP to be higher than the number of physical cores. Spreading a heavy parallel workload across logical processors will just increase overhead with no real benefit.
When setting MAXDOP you typically want to limit it to the number of cores in a NUMA node. That way schedules aren't trying to access memory across numa nodes.
As a general rule, use higher DOP for an OLAP system, and lower (or no) DOP for an OLTP system. Many systems are somewhere in between, so find a happy medium that allows the occasional large workload to get enough CPU to complete quickly, without strangling your OLTP workloads.
This version gives you a nice single result set with the existing MAXDOP setting and should hold up on versions SQL 2008-2017 without the need to use xp_cmdshell.
There's also a hyperthread_ratio column, but I'm not certain what it represents. The documentation isn't very clear either. The number I see on our system suggests it could either be the number of physical cores in the entire system, or the number of logical processors per chip. The documentation claims I should be seeing a different figure entirely.
