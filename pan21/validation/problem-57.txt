The code is written using Frescobaldi as IDE and using LilyPond (docs) as format and engraving tool under the hood. The music is engraved to PDF and a MIDI file is generated.
Note: the chords should be sustained longer than can be heard in the provided audio, an unfortunate conversion artefact unrelated to the code written.
Assuming that this is the entire piece rather than an excerpt, you should end it with a double bar line:
It is very good practice to include all bar checks to help you catch rhythm mistakes, and to make the code easier to read:
I want to share one of the easier pieces. A shortened, simplified piano version of Morning Wood (Morgenstemning) by Edvard Grieg. Specifically, it's a 1:1 translation of the version provided by Flowkey (no affiliation).
Basically, it works like a charm, the result looks like a charm, but the code itself could use some serious clean-up.
While learning to play the keyboard, I find it helpful to write down the score of the pieces I play, regardless of whether a score already exists.
