In my eyes it is very unlikely that your live system with at least a two-way mirror and three offsite disks die at the same time. If one of the backups is still usable, you would have only lost the data of a week, which is much less severe (and can be mitigated by e.g. differential online backup of only newly modified files).
I am currently in the process of setting up a decent home NAS. The main concern is integrity of the data and I therefore decided on using ZFS as a filesystem. Unfortunately this does put some requirements (or recommendations to be more precise) on the hardware that make it a rather expensive solution. This prohibits me from implementing an off-site backup on a similar system and I am therefore looking for an alternative solution.
Ideally, I would have three removable hard drives of which one would sit near the server and be connected weekly or so. The others would remain off-site and they'll be rotated every now and then. I am aware that this poses a risk to new data, but I'm planning to back this up in an alternate way.
The question is what I should put on the removable drives. Initially I thought of putting a zpool on each and using zpool send and zpool recv to update them, like here. I do however think that it is quite possible that the drives are "damaged" once I need to put back the backup and I would like ZFS to take care of that. Ideally all three removable drives would be in a mirror configuration up to two drive swaps ago, which will allow ZFS to use all of them to fix problems in the old data when restoring the backup. The drives will however never be connected at the same time, so this might not be possible. Does ZFS provide a means to implement what I am after, or should I use a different method?
If you go for the second solution, be sure to also enable regular data snapshots to guard against things like encryption malware (which would be mitigated somewhat by having multiple disks). Also, be sure to still distribute the three disks and store them in different places to guard against fire/theft/loss.
But assuming it will happen, let's compare all possible backup configurations (each time assuming your live system has 2 disks as mirrors and all 5 disks are of equal size):
I don't know your exact hardware and performance needs, but be advised that decent systems can be quite cheap if you know what you are looking for and can accept some slight downsides. Specifically:
So, in summary: It depends what is more critical to your needs - multiple independent points in time, or a single one that is more resilient against failure.
