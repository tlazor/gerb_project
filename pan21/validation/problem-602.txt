Linux systems have a 'file' tool that can tell you if a file is a jpg file by content, not by extension. Look into cygwin, maybe it has this tool too.
If you're SURE you made it without an extension, there's not many files in the Windows directory that don't have extensions, so it should be easy to locate.
What OS are you using? If you're on Windows 7 and remember any other properties of the image such as date modified or size, you can just specify kind:=picture and supply values for the other properties, and Windows should run off and fetch a list. Set the view to be thumbnails so that you help you do a visual search of the image files on your drive.
Then you'll have a list of every single file without an extension in a text file called files.txt in the root of your C:
If you've accessed the file recently it could be amongst the ones listed under Documents in your Start menu (I don't know if there is Documents item on Windows 7 though). If it's there, you may at least see what its extension is if only the name has been renamed.
