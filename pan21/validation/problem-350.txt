One such product is Tripp Lite's Server Remote Control, External KVM over IP and another is the Lantronix Spider KVM
This is far from an out-of-the-box solution, but you might be able to adapt something like the Teensy USB to accomplish this mission.  I would envision configuring the Teensy USB to appear as a keyboard, then loading a program onto the Teensy USB that 
At that point you could use the Teensy's ethernet and keyboard libraries to write a small program that spawns a server using Server.begin(), waits for a connection, and then has an infinite while loop with something like the following content to create a one-way network echo server:
Alternatively, you can rebuild a DIY version of one of these with only keyboard support (rather than keyboard, video, and mouse support) using a Teensy USB Dev Board connected to a WIZ712MJ ethernet module with the WIZ812 Ethernet Adaptor Kit
I personally wired one to a footpedal and programmed it to send the 's' keystroke when I stepped on the pedal, but that project was much much simpler than what you would need.
Simply connect up the KVM's keyboard (and optionally the video and mouse) to the computer you want to send remote keystrokes to.
You then connect to the IP on the KVM via your web browser or the provided native system app, and send whatever keystrokes you wish.
You can use a micro controller to receive keystrokes via network and transfer them to the computer it is connected to. One possible option would be Arduino platform and it's keyboard library as it may be simpler than making the hardware and libraries yourself. You will also need DIY software to send the keystrokes and, in case of Arduino it can be written in its IDE(simplified JAVA environment) . There are other platforms out there and most can be scaled down in production environment if you find this to be too big or expensive to deploy (as you may need more than one). 
You'll likely want to flesh that out with some error checking and the like, but it should work as a skeleton.
