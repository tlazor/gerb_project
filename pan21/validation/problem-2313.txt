Yes, it is doable. If it is apache, load mod_authz_ldap and point to your Active directory. Or point it to openldap proxy, which fetches auth credentials from active directory.
There are two technologies for that: Kerberos and NTLM. There are a lot of info on how to implement both, the best choice will depend on your IT environment.
Some questions: Do you use Active Directory for authentication? What is your webserver? IIS on Windows, Apache on Linux? Something else? What are the apps? What auth methods do they offer? 
Basically, this is possible. If your particular webapp is capable of handling this depends on your environment and if this webapp is prepared for this. 
Regardless of the technology, prepare for a challenging experience, as doing this right is quite difficult. 
The most important thing you should research in this regard is Kerberos, which is used by Active Directory (and many other things) for exactly this purpose: Single sign on. 
Is there a way to integrate an LDAP authentication system on a windows network with intranet webapps so that the user on logging into their desktop does not need to log in a second time with the web app?
