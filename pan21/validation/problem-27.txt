If Packets  Size Above Port(Router)  MTU(Default 1500 for FastEthernet, 9000 for Gigabit Interface)  then Packets  Count as GIANT Packets and Reject that Packets .
Every protocol layered on top of Ethernet must deal with this. ARP deals with it by ignoring "junk" after the data.
Who is adding those 18 bytes, and why? Is it the sender, the switch, or the receiver? And what do they mean? 
Because in Packets  header size is 64 header it self, so seems Packets  not include with Data some reason of Packets  Corruption.
Just Want to add Extra Information (Networking Perspective) , Why Router not Accept Packets in Which Condition 
The arp packet received is 18 bytes larger than the arp packet sent. I'm trying to figure out whether or not this is normal, or a problem. (This packet is ultimately bound for a virtual machine instance which isn't receiving it correctly). 
There's an 8 byte preamble, a 6 byte destination MAC, a 6 byte source MAC, a 2 byte type/length, user data, and a 4 byte frame check sequence. Since the minimum packet is 64 bytes, that means the user data cannot be fewer than 46 bytes.
If Packets  Size 1519-1564 , this Packets  called Jambo baby Packets  and accept only where Port MTU is 9000 
I'm trying to debug a networking issue. During this process, I've noticed that when I try to do an arping, the received arp packets are larger than sent arp packets, as outputted by tcpdump.
