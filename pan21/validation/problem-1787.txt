Apple's chargers are "universal," meaning they'll work with any country's AC power. All you need is an adapter to allow you to physically insert the prongs of the plug into the wall socket.
To determine if any given device is universal, look on the bottom or side of the unit. If something on the label reads "100-240v" or "110-220v" or something like that, it'll work. If, on the other hand, it reads something like "110v only", then it is not safe to plug into a 220v socket.
Please note that a lot of those wall sockets that short-circuit D+ and D- and then you don't have to negotiate how much current you can draw (and as much as 1A should be ok).
To illustrate I'll relate my experience. The kids have got iPod Touches and were using the PC charger. We were due to go on holiday without the computer but with the iPods so they wanted a way of charging them. I investigated the options and went for a third party charger whose specs matched.
It arrived and we plugged it in. The iPod started charging then there was a little "pop" and faint electrical smell. The charger had fused. I contacted the supplier and they sent a 2nd unit out. We tried this one - there was a spark, a loud "bang" and a definite electrical smell. This one had nearly exploded. I contacted the supplier again and they refunded the costs.
Should be safe for any USB device (5.5 volts I believe). It's the amperage you'd have to watch out for, but it should be fine. 
The usb spec tells us Vbus = 5VDC, and then the device can start with 0.1A (but the device "can ask" for as much as 0.5A).
As others have said, you need to make sure that the DC output of the charger matches the input requirements of the iPod, but even then it might not work. If possible get the charger from the manufacturer of the device.
