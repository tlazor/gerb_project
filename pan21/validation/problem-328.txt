Macs have done IP over Thunderbolt since they first included Thunderbolt in 2012, and Intel created a Windows driver to do this sometime around mid 2014. Thunderbolt IP networking uses a 10 gigabit Thunderbolt channel, so it could be up to 10x as fast as your typical gigabit Ethernet dongle that you can get for either Thunderbolt 2 or USB-C.
Note that although these interfaces show up as Ethernet interfaces and go 10 gigabits per second, this does NOT require you to get any kind of 10 gigabit Ethernet (10GBASE-T) adapters. It's doing 10gbps IP networking over Thunderbolt directly.
I know on the Mac this is plug-and-play, and I believe the same is true on Windows nowadays but I'm not sure. For a while after Intel first delivered this driver for Windows 8.x, you had to install it yourself. I'm hoping it's built into Windows 10 by now.
As for performance, I hooked up two random Macs via Thunderbolt networking and ran a quick iPerf TCP/IPv4 performance test, and got around 8Gbps.
To do Thunderbolt IP between these devices, you'll need a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter (which looks just like a USB-C male to Mini DisplayPort female adapter, but is different on the inside), and a Thunderbolt cable (which looks just like a Mini DisplayPort male-male cable, but is different on the inside).
