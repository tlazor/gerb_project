Two others are similar...Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux(DSL for short). These two can be very small distros'...some people report a complete operating system with KDE or even Gnome under 50mb.
It sounds like you're over thinking Linux. Any Linux distribution allows for a customized kernel, that's the point (and one of many powerful features) of Linux.  You should install any of the big name Linux distros with a package system and be good to go.  For instance in Fedora ( http://www.fedoraproject.org ) you can simply select Add/Remove Software and select a "collection" like Developer Libraries and it installs the proper packages.
You could have a look at rPath Linux. There's this rBuilder service which allows for building custom distros. It sounds like they are mainly presenting themselves as a virtual appliance building platform, but you may be able to use the result on real hardware as well.
I have built several of these from Slax, Puppy and DSL where each was customized for the computer at hand.
This is what you want. You build your own custom open source operating system by scrolling or searching through the site for the modules you want...check the box next to the ones you want and when you've finished your selection select "BUILD"(choose your boot platform,ie. Live Cd or Live USB) and your done.
However you will need to do more than just "tick a few boxes", but the build will be relatively painless, very lightweight and easy to script for repeatability.
