When a single wire is rolled up, magnetic fields from whatever source induce currents, adding noise to the signal. This phenomenon also occurs in ethernet cables, but the latter has multiple wires inside, carrying currents in opposite directions. Pairs of wires are generally twisted so that 'on average', both are occupying the same physical space and are exposed to the same magnetic effects. The resulting forces cancel, very similar to someone pulling equally hard on both ends of a rope on a pulley.
There is a limit, though, to the length of an individual run from hub to device -- 100 meters.  Over that and timings get screwed up, even if the electrical signal is solid.  So if someone were to attempt this with a much longer spool of wire there could be a problem.
Rolling up excess wire in a coil can greatly impact its electrical properties and cause interference by literally turning them into inductors and antennas. but you will not effect any significant loss in signal quality by putting away an ethernet cable like this., unless you are subjecting it to enough abuse for mechanical stress to become an issue. A common rule of thumb is to never bend it with a radius under four times the cable's diameter. The coil in your image does not look like it is anywhere near violating that.
While in theory there can be a (small) problem, in practice I've never seen it, and others haven't reported a problem either.  The fact that the cable is balanced twisted pair eliminates most inductive effects in the coil.
Ok, I have tested this in the worst case scenario. I work for a company that tests and refurbs cable modems, gateways and routers. Our testers sre designed to test 12 units at a time. The cable were coiled up tightly out of the way. This caused units to show a false failure on lost packets. We used shorter ethernet cables to avoid coiling and the problem has been resolved. The longer cables were re-used elsewhere without issues.
