That is not the pathname, as the output of the immediately preceding command showed.  The pathname is either (hd0,gpt2)/grub or (hd0,gpt2)/grub2, since those are the directories that actually exist on your volume.  (Which of the two, you'll have to work out for yourself.)  Indeed, since you've set root to that volume the prefix could be simply:
For multiple boots using grub2, some people may be making the same mistake I did when installing or updating Fedora 19 on a drive different than the drive that Windows is installed on.  I’ll admit that I’m guilty of not following the basic rule when updating software: “RTFM”.  I’m sure everybody knows what that stands for.

In my case, I replaced Fedora 16 on two computers – one that also has Windows 7 and the other that has Windows 8.  In both cases, I failed, during the installation process, to include the device where the bootloader was to be put (for me, this is /dev/sda in both computers, where Windows is stored on).
When you come to the “Installation Destination” dialog, you need to specify the device that Windows is stored as well as the device where Fedora 19 is to go if it is different than the Windows device.  In my case, it’s /dev/sdb on both computers, where Fedora 16 resides, which will be replaced with Fedora 19.  After you select the devices, you need to click “Full disk summary and bootloader …” at the bottom of the dialog just to make sure that the correct device is selected for the bootloader (dev/sda in my case).
When i boot my PC, i get this in my Fedora 16 distro. I have tried as following but none allowing me to boot anymore. Any help please? I am blocked completely.
You then need to do custom partitioning if you want to delete the old linux partitions and replace them with partitions for Fedora 19.
Your system should hopefully boot into linux at this point. You booted into linux, but these changes are not permanent. To make them permanent, go into the command prompt and enter the following command: 
When the tool says that it cannot find the file that you've named, try believing the error message and correcting the name.
