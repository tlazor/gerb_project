When you use speed dial on a regular basis, you know the order of the dials by heart. In this case, it is not necessary to first open the speed dial window and then select the dial. Instead, you can immediately open the desired page in the current window by pressing [Ctr+dialNumber]. For instance, if the desired page is the third dial, just press [Ctr+3].
Speed dial actually appears on every new tab, but is there a way to open the speed dial in the active tab?
