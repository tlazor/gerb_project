The reason that you're having a hard time filling this position is because it's generally hard to be good in a management context and good in a technical sense.
Please note, I think it's possible to go the other way as well - get a manager and train him/her up on the tech. But you probably have tech needs that are going unmet right now, and can't wait too long to get that technical expertise in-house. Whereas you probably do have managers in-house who can take your techie/manager-in-training under their wings for a time.
Management is all about communication and compromise, of course. Sysadmin work tends to encourage lots of head-down concentration and/or after-hours work (few orgs want major reconfigurations done during business hours, whether they realize this or not). Additionally, the systems we admin tend to be a lot more brittle than people - there's not a lot of "give and take" in them. Our systems demand that we speak and listen to them very precisely. Many of us sysadmins begin expecting the same level of speaking/listening precision from all of our working colleagues, which of course gives us our famous reputation for being stubborn and hard to work with.
I'm a techie who took management courses. I recall thinking how silly and commonsense much of that management training was, while I was taking the courses. And yet how often I now draw on that same training, and how often I watch people who haven't had such training make classic communications/management mistakes.
From what you have posted, I assume you want to target your search toward experienced IT professionals, rather than the wide net of craigslist or your local job boards.
In this sense the two professions are somewhat orthogonal - especially if no cross training is applied.
Please edit your post and add the specific technologies that you would require an applicant to be proficient with as well as what skills and certifications, length of experience, etc that you would prefer for a candidate. I understand that may be hard to qualify but most people are going to have a hard time interpreting what "qualified person" is for your organization. This coupled with the fact that you already state it is "highly selective" means it is probably not worth anyone's time to respond to your post without more concrete information up front.
Great managers are scarce. Great managers who are also strongly experienced and current in "IIS, SQL Server, Exchange, Active Directory" are really really scarce - and are likely happily employed already. 
So my advice would be: find a good and gregarious sysadmin with technical experience to resolve your technical needs immediately, and have him/her do a formal course of management training during the first year of employment. It doesn't have to  be a degree course - your local community college probably offers some sort of seminar series.
Perhaps taking a different look at your org structure is in order.  Find a really good manager from a business perspective (with a strong technical background) who has really strong technical lead positions that he can rely on.
Personally I think it is possible to have a techie grow management skills, or a manager grow techie skills, but I think it very unlikely you'll find a person who is great at both trades naturally. So I think it's wise to look for someone who gained one of the skills through career experience, and has spent some effort to gain the other skill via formal training.
Those that have a strong technical background who find themselves moving into management, have a harder time keeping current with their technical abilities as the management (business end) takes up more and more time.
