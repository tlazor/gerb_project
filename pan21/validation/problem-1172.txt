I recently set up SSH on my Raspberry Pi. It has been going swimmingly, especially since I can control the computer through my iPhone with the app Server Auditor. Sadly, this only works through the local network. 
SocketXP provides a simple, secure and easy way to access your home RaspberryPi from the outside network. SocketXP doesn't require you to hack any settings in your WiFi router.  It works out of the box.  To know how to setup your RaspberryPi to SSH from outside, read this blog on how to remote SSH into your RaspberryPi using SocketXP.
This question is old, as time goes on there are fewer chances of you getting a public accessible IPv4-address. Most likely you are behind a CGNAT, meaning you share a single public IPv4 with other customers of the ISP. So it is not possible to do a port-forward to your PI or anything else.
Accessing your RaspberryPi ( or even laptops/servers) from outside your home network (meaning, from the internet) is not an easy task, because your home laptop or RaspberryPi has only local IP address ( in the 10.x.x.x range or 192.168.x.x range).  It doesn't have a Public IP address that is visible from the Internet.
You could also get a cheap VPS (virtual private server) with a public IPv4 somewhere in the cloud, and make a SSH-tunnel from the PI to the VPS.
The simple answer to your question is use free online services like SocketXP which provides a secure public tunnel endpoint to SSH into your RaspberryPi from outside the home network. 
If you have IPv6, you can give your PI a static address, and allow access to it on your router. Many mobile providers now give IPv6 to phones.
