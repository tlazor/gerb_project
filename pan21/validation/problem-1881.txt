Of course, if you need something totall free, get FileZilla server and you can manually map each account to its own Windows directory.  A bit more configuration but its free.
You might also want to think about security as well as FTP is targeted quiet often, i typically silently banner IP addresses after a number of failed attempts, make sure i update the welcome message to remove software versions etc, and lock the admin interface down to an internal IP address range. 
If you are used to windows software it is fairly straight forward to get started with and creating user accounts and setting permissions is straight forward as well. If you create an ftp directory somewhere on your hard drive and then sub-folders within that for each user when creating the accounts you can just give the user access to that folder. It also means your super user account can have full control form the level above to add / remove files as needed.
For $99 you can get a license of WinSSHD that can be configured to only allow FTP into the users home directory.   Also, if the remote server is a Windows server edition (not home or professional), then you get multiple separate terminal service sessions.   A lot for $100.
I have been using FileZilla server version with out issue for the last couple of years, i have also used bullet proof ftp as well. Filezilla seems to do the job equally as well so have stuck with that. 
We have been using the application CrushFTP for sveral years and it ws inexpensive and very feature rich.  Support is excellemnt and all suers need is a web browser to upload or download.  It supports secure transfers and has extensive reporting and alerting.  Great features to protect against various attacks.  It was easy to set up and users like all the features and security. Supports a number of platforms and uses few resourses.
If it was me i would down load the software from sourceforge and install on the box which is going to act as your FTP server. I would then test it on your local area network before figuring out all the IP mapping and firewall options.
