If this does not work, another way you can get mysql to work is to change user in /etc/mysql/my.cnf to root; though there are no doubt some issues with doing that from a security perspective.
Naturally I would have thought the -a switch should have taken care of everything. But upon checking  the execute bit for o(thers), for /var and /mnt, they are different, the latter's is disabled. So I enabled it and yes, it is now functioning.
The thing is, mysql is not the first occupant of /mnt/var/lib. I earlier moved PostgreSQL datadir there, and it did not complain about having no execute permissions for o.
Reinstalled AppArmor and moved the MySql profile under disabled profiles of AppArmor, even then it did not work. 
If you move your datadir, you not only need to give the new datadir permissions, but you need to insure all parent directories have permission.
The issue is with AppArmor. I am not sure why MySql is unable to access files even after uninstalling AppArmor. 
I faced the same issue... In Ubuntu systems you need to change the permissions for the new datadir.
