Unfortunately the answer is no. Because most things that will give a vector output, wont give a faithful representation of the website. The best bet is to make a copy of the webpage, adjust it to a larger size(CSS), then use the browser to confirm it is as close as possible to the original. 
On Mac OS X you are able to print to PDF, this works extremely well for my resume which I then have printed out at Kinkos and give out to potential employers.
The results are a faithful rendering of the page generated by the Winnovative SDK. This  provides a much better result than straight printing from the browser or taking screenshots as the text is still vector and only the images are scaled.
Try the PDF Download bookmarklet. It will generate a high quality PDF of any webpage that is publicly accessible. 
Using firefox's "print to file" option, you can get a very faithful representation of the site in vector format(postscript).
Once you have it good enough (it will never be perfect), print to PDF then use a tool like adobe illustrator to import, retouch and export as encapsulated PDF, for inclusion in the publication.
