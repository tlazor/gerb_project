The permissions for the role is correct (table has select, delete, update and insert, sequence has select, and procedure has execute). So why don't I see the indexes? Is there an additional grant that needs to be provided to the role for the table?
Oracle data dictionary views that have the ALL_ prefix provide information about objects that your user has access to.  Views that have the DBA_ prefix provide information about all objects in the database.  And views that have the USER_ prefix provide information about objects that you own.
In this case, MYDBUSER does not and can not have privileges on the indexes owned by MYDBOWNER because there are no privileges one can grant on individual indexes so it makes sense that MYDBUSER would not see the indexes in ALL_OBJECTS.  If MYDBUSER were granted access to DBA_OBJECTS or DBA_INDEXES (either individually or via the SELECT ANY DICTIONARY privilege), you could query DBA_OBJECTS (or DBA_INDEXES) to get a list of all the indexes owned by MYDBOWNER.  
I have two instances of an oracle 11g database, both have the same object definitions in the schema: tables with indexes and constraints, a sequence, and a stored procedure.
