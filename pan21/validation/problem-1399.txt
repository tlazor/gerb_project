If you can't accomplish whatever your Admin tasks are through WMI/CIM, or Powershell... You're probably not running the right OS.
Hate to break the news to the person above who says that windows rdp connection is not accepted in windows pe. Because literally 5 minutes ago i grabbed an rdp shortcut off my server that connects to windows multipoint server 2011. works like a charm!  as far as this goes, im trying add that file to windows pe as a desktop shortcut I will be more than happy to keep you posted on how this can be done. but more than possible to click an rdp connection off of a server drive and run it, if it does not connect to \SERVEREXAMPLE
if you have to grab a thumb drive and place it on desktop. only issue is you have to do this every time a machine boots up. as far as my network setup is, i have 2 NAT the one underneath my head NAT is windows server 2008 R2 with DHCP and DNS Server. This has windows deployment services installed as well. Its a setup for 2 separate networks. So far no issues at all. 
You CAN add Powershell, WMI and CIM Cmdlets. Also Bitlocker Cmdlets and Disk-Storage Management Cmdlets to Win-PE though... Powershell is a little crippled though but still works great! You are limited also by the size of the scratch space on your PE Image for commands you need. I added Sysinternals tools which fit nicely. :(
You need the DART version and tools which give you the remote session viewer.  See http://www.deploymentresearch.com/Research/tabid/62/EntryId/36/Software-Assurance-Pays-Off-Remote-Connection-to-WinPE-during-MDT-SCCM-deployments.aspx for an example.
Win-PE is designed mainly for Preparing the System prior to OS installation. Also for "Capturing" OS Images.
I'm trying to find the way to configure WinPE (Windows Preinstallation Environment) 8.0 for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection.
