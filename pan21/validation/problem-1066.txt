Take a look at things like this.  The last few causes are hypothetical (they would cause it, but I've never found evidence that they did), but the first is ubiquitous.
Edit: If the users profile is only local, check the permissions as well or if it's even there (C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME).

Windows cannot find the local profile and is logging you on with a temporary profile. Changes you make to this profile will be lost when you log off.}
The error message basically says Windows can't load the user's registry hive to HKEY_CURRENT_USERS because it's already been locked for writing.  I draw your attention to C:\Documents and Settings\XXXX\ntuser.dat.
Windows has backed up this user's profile. Windows will automatically try to use the backed up profile the next time this user logs on.

Windows cannot load the locally stored profile. Possible causes of this error include insufficient security rights or a corrupt local profile. If this problem persists, contact your network administrator. 
DETAIL - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.  for C:\Documents and Settings\XXXX\ntuser.dat

1) Run a chkdsk to see if there are errors with the drive, make sure you select check for bad sectors
