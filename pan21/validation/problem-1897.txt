I am using only SSH as I cannot get IPMI/KVM to work and they've since disconnected the IPMI connection anyway.
On Friday, the database server had started to drop connections randomly one after the other so I thought I'd check the error logs for anything unusual - There was nothing out of the ordinary so I backed up my MySQL databases (As I do before every reboot) and then done a reboot on the operating system.
Unfortunately, if your backups were also on the disk that failed, you're out of luck. Generally, unlike a failing mechanical disk, a SSD failure generally means the controller is dead, rather than just certain blocks or areas. Looking at the dmesg or /var/log/messages output may tell you more, but it's not likely to be good news.
All three are running CentOS 6.7, two are used for webservers while the third is used as only for MySQL databases connecting to the two webservers.
This to me meant BIOS problem (I may be wrong) Now the server host has given me IPMI/KVM to maintain the server remotely, however I could not get the infuriating pile of java crap to work so I sent a support ticket asking for assistance. They replied 12 hours later saying nothing more than "Your SSD has failed, we have ordered you a new one"
I cannot get it to read the 250GB SSD for mounting. So my question is, is there any alternative way to get my data from the drive? ANYTHING at all, I have nothing to lose as of now.
It's been a back and forth discussion (nearly an argument) explaining a new SSD is useless if I don't have my database backup to even go on it. Finally, I got them to reinstall CentOS on another drive so I can try to mount the "broken" SSD and recover my data.
