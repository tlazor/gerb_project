What are xCord and yCord? Are they the center of the light's location? Why not call them xCenter and yCenter? Also, my Javascript is really rusty. Can you have structures? If so, why not have a Point structure (or class) which contains an x and y member and manipulate that? It will be easier to read.
(Sorry if my syntax is off, but I think you get the idea.) Then the above variable declarations can look like this:
The second problem is that you're adding a lot more light than I think you intended to. You should only multiply red, green, and blue by il, and add them to the existing data in the array. Above you're adding the new color to the existing color, multiplying by the illumination, and then adding it to the existing color again! It should be something like this:
What do yp, yt and yw represent? It looks like yp is supposed to be the vertical distance from the center. I would think using j - yCenter would be a more direct way of calculating that. And I would call it yDistance or something like that. yt is obviously the square of yp which is fine for seeing if we're within the radius of the light's circle. Note that you can't directly using it for calculating the light's intensity if you're looking for realistic lighting, though. I don't understand what yw is at all. In fact, I don't see yy declared anywhere, so I don't see how this code works. Perhaps it was a transcription error?
What is data? That's way too general of a name to be useful. From looking at the code, it seems like it's the pixel buffer. Why not call it pixels or something more meaningful? Also, just expand w and h to width and height.
You've repeated some code here 4 times. When you find yourself repeating code, it's probably best to break it out into a function. I'd make a clamp function, like this:
Don't use offsets in an array to represent different types of data. If you can treat your data as the actual type of data it is, that's much easier to read and maintain. If you can format it as data.red, data.green, and data.blue, then you should do it that way.
And why not pick better names for those, too? How about xMin, xMax, yMin, and yMax? It will make the loop below clearer, too.
does not give you the actual distance from the center (or its inverse). For that, you need to take the square root of d and divide it by radius. So it should probably be:
I'm guessing that you updated your code since you got the first response. The variable names are certainly an improvement over single-character names, but could still use some work.
If you're looking to speed this up, I'd go with WebGL. It's a lot of work to learn if you don't already know it, but you'll get much better performance. Keep in mind that not every browser supports it, and not every user enables it, so that may make it a bad choice.
Rather than i and j, why not column and row, since you're iterating over rows and columns of pixels?
