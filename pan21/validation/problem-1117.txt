Pi 2 Design is excited to introduce the first Tube Amp specifically designed for any of the 40-pin versions of the Raspberry Pi SBC Family. The 503HTA Hybrid Tube Amp HAT, designed and manufactured by Pi2Media (a division of PI 2 Design), is a High Quality I/O Shield designed to bring “Sweet Tube Sound” to the Raspberry PI ® family of Single Board Computers. This HAT allows the Raspberry Pi ® SBC to drive Headphones from 32 – 300 ohm with ease and fidelity.
Based on the popular Bravo V2 design with all recommended Mods, the On-Board PCM5102A DAC drives the single stage 12AU7 (or 6922) tube. The Class-A Output Stage is comprised of the IRL510 and LM317A. The dedicated heater supply insures zero crosstalk.
If you have already gone into /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and changed options snd-usb-audio index=-2 to options snd-usb-audio index=0 then:
This works because when you add options snd-usb-audio index=0 to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf it only sets your usb card at index 0, it doesn't enable it.
