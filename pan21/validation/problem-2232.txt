3# Different protocols are for different services. For example, EWS service is mainly responsible for free/busy, OOF, mailtips and Outlook for Mac connection. ActiveSync is for mobile devices to access. RPC/HTTP and MAPI/HTTP are for Outlook connection. But it doesn't mean that only one protocol is needed for a specific client. For example, even when the Outlook connects to Exchange via RPC/HTTP, it will connect to EWS service when querying free/busy data.
For the external clients, make sure to publish the namespace autodiscover.domain.com, mail.domain.com, and the MX records. If you have firewall or proxy server, you may need to set the rule to publish these services. You can google the document related to the firewall/proxy setting you plan to use.
Actually, all of the protocols you mentioned above are based on HTTPS, they use the same port TCP 443 and same certificate(binding with IIS service on Exchange server). And we always use the same namespace for Outlook Anywhere, ActiveSync, EWS service, OAB virtual directory and MAPI/HTTP, such as mail.domain.com.
