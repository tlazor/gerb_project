It is possible that the partition in question is supposed to have manufacturer provided software on it.  I have seen USB sticks with virtual CD-ROM drives to provide access to drivers.  If this is the case the 12MB partition, there is nothing you can do about it.
I have tried deleting in Windows, using Disk Management and 3rd party disk management utilities. I have also tried to delete it in Linux using fdisk and Gpart. All were telling me the disk is read-only and they were unable to perform the operation.
I received a brand-less USB Thumb Drive during a function, those cheap made in China kind. When plugged in, it shows 2 drives, one 8GB and one 12MB drive(not partition). I am trying to remove the 12MB completely or at least delete the contents of it because it came with a trojan. However, that drive appears to be Read-Only and is impossible to delete. The 8GB portion is working fine.
There is no write protect switch on the usb drive. I somehow believe that the 12MB part is hard wired to write protect, or is some ROM, but I am not completely sure. I have searched everywhere until I have no choice but to ask. If anyone knows how to get around this, would really be appreciated.
