In this case, go to PassMark's website (passmark.com) and download their free OSFMount product (http://osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html). This software will let you convert your Windows disk image to an ISO. After you have the ISO, you can mount the ISO as a read/write drive image using VMWare Workstation or you can use any other ISO utility to view the files. Just don't burn the ISO image to a read-only CD/DVD/BluRay because you will then have a read-only image and won't be able to modify NTFS permissions, if needed.
I don't work for PassMark but I want to congratulate the company for making such a fine tool available for free. They offer a catalog of other products (some are not free) but they're all of excellent quality.
Although this is an older post, I have a solution: What those who commented above didn't seem to understand is that sometimes a VMDK can be mounted or mapped to using VMWare Workstation only in READ ONLY mode. This usually is due to corruption of the VMDK or could be due to the fact that you have existing snapshots or a suspended virtual machine. Either way, if you mount the disk successfully but it's in read-only mode, you're in trouble because you won't be able to change the NTFS permissions on a users subfolder for those folders for which you have insufficient permissions.
