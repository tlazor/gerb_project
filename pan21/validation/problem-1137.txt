I'm behind a firewall with incoming connections blocked on all ports. I'd like to run an Apache Web Server on my machine. Is it possible to configure a free public proxy server to forward the incoming connections to my local server through the firewall?
You don't need a proxy outside of the firewall blocking your machine, because if no one else can connect to your machine how can the proxy? All you need to do is make an exception in the firewall to forward ports to your server. If you have access to the router that is acting as a firewall, log in and turn on port forwarding, forward port 80 from the router to your LAN address.
If you don't have access to whatever is acting as the firewall there is no way anyone outside your LAN can access your machine unless you connect to the outside world first. An example of this is SSH tunelling, which judging by your question might be too complex to implement.
You can use VPN service with port forwarding support for this. Here is example https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/ although you can't enable it for 80 port but it will work with the port they provide. 
Now, connections to proxyserver.example.com:8888 should be forwarded to your local port 80. The details from the ssh(1) manpage:
