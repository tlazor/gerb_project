remote.sh is very limited it what you can do with it, but I wouldn't be surprised if you could just add other option. 
(In the above, my KEY_F is mapped to the FM key on my IR remote.)  I'd like to map volume up and down (pianobar uses ( and ) for volume control) and quit q to keys on the remote, however setting prog = echo "q" or prog = q don't pass those buttons to pianobar.  Does anyone have any experience with controlling pianobar with an IR remote?  I don't have to use irexec but that's about where my knowledge caps out at the moment.
I've set up pianobar using the Adafruit instructions with the exception of the LCD panel.  I also have my IR remote working using lirc and these instructions.  I can get irexec to do simple shell commands such as mpg321 song.mp3 and even start pianobar by setting something like this in my .lircrc file:
It seems you can also control pianobar from the command line, instead of the UI. I see a file called remote.sh in the git-repository. Either find it in your filesystem, or just copy and past in into your own remote.sh file.
