Now your plugin will run as root.  But it most likely can't do anything complicated (e.g. run programs that have a domain other than bin_t), because your plugin still running as the nrpe_t domain.  This domain very deliberately has restrictive permissions; it can't even write to files in /tmp.
Edit: You can find a bunch of the selinux bools for nagios here: http://wiki.centos.org/TipsAndTricks/SelinuxBooleans
If you want you can also try to lower it. If its currently set to enforcing you can switch it to permissive and see if it lets you run NRPE. Also you may be able to find some more walkthroughs on setting up NRPE using SELinux. Honestly I always find it to be too much of an annoyance to be worth the security. HTH
Well, first decide if you want SELinux. All EL based ones have it installed and enabled by default, but pretty much no other distro does. It gives you a bit of security, but more than a bit of headaches, so you have to weigh one way or the other whether you want it. If you don't, you can disable it in the /etc/selinux/config. The comments in the file will tell you exactly what to do.
I noticed that the AVC message contains path="/usr/bin/sudo".  This means that NRPE is b0rking when trying to use sudo to invoke a plugin.
