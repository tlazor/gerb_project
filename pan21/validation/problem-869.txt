(If possible) Ask them to reboot and to describe the boot screen animation. Windows Vista has a pulsating Windows orb (like the Start button, only pulsating.) Windows 7 has the four colors of the Windows flag fly together (see Youtube examples below.) 
Assuming the default single-height taskbar, then Windows 7 has two lines: time and date, where Vista has just the time.
The date in the bottom right corner gives a big clue, but it isn't foolproof. You can see it without typing anything.
Since you are looking for a visual distinction, perhaps the most notable is the task bar. In default Windows 7, the task bar buttons are squares and have no text but big icons. Windows Vista has rectangular task bar buttons and text besides the icon.
Perhaps if you could ask the user to try to do what he's usually doing with the computer (browsing, reading mails, ...), and then ask him to read the text in the task bar if there is any? Or ask about the shape of the newly appeared button?
In fact, if you have an account on there, you can send them to a custom link and it will automatically give you a detailed report - they don't even have to read stuff out to you over the phone.
