If you had the mail server forward mail to the exchange server rather then the exchange server fetch the mail. Then a copy would always be on the server. That's a work around if exchange server doesn't allow leaving a copy on the mail server.
There are quite a few tools to use to get Exchange to retrieve (pull) mail from an external source (I'm assuming POP3 in your case) and deliver to internal mailboxes.  Which one are you using?  You'll need to configure the tool you're using in Exchange to leave the mail on the remote server.  Keep in mind that it's possible the tool you're using doesn't support that option.
Bit of a long shot, but I've seen this happen at an individual mailbox level, where Outlook has been incorrectly configured to deliver emails to a PST file instead of an OST file.
Double-check the mailbox options in Outlook under the Data Files tab and see what's set up there. If there is a PST file configured as the default delivery location, you'll need to set up an OST file, then use the File > Import/Export tool to restore the data back to the mailbox.
I've had to use this before for a client running SBS 2003.  The company mail was hosted (POP3) but they wanted other features of Exchange.  In my case I used Microsoft's Exchange Connector for POP3 Mailboxes.  It was, um, somewhat evil.
