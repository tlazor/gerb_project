DNS is hierarchical. When you added the name _acme-challenge.blurp.basjes.nl, that meant that blurp.basjes.nl was also implicitly added. The bit here that may be surprising is that a name can exist without having any content. When you used dig to ask for blurp.basjes.nl, you got a perfectly correct and accurate answer: the name exists, but contains no records. This case, where a name exists only because there are other names below it in the DNS tree, is called an empty non-terminal. You can google that term if you want to know more.
That's the first part of your confusing behavior. The second part is this: a wildcard record is used to generate an answer if and only if the name asked for does not already exist. So, first you asked for blurp.basjes.nl and got an answer generated from the wildcard. Then you added _acme-challenge.blurp.basjes.nl. When you asked again after that, the name blurp.basjes.nl did exist (as described above), so the wildcard was not used. But since blurp.basjes.nl had no records in it, all you got back was an empty response. After that you added a CNAME record for blurp.basjes.nl, so when you asked yet again that's what you got back.
