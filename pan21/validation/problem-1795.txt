What I found - sharing notebooks for data scientists is a not a desirable format for communication. Many of them prefer IDE like Spider/RStudio or just a text editors (I know a few data scientists who use vi).
Airbnb recently open sourced their internal data science knowledge repository: https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo
You might just share code by your source control and data by cloud storages. It will increase flexibility.
Domino Data Lab offers premises, SaaS, and VPC-based notebook hosting (Jupyter, Zeppelin, RStudio), git integration, scalable compute, environment templates, and a bunch of other useful things. The premises/ VPC offerings may be overkill and too pricey if you're a small team, but the SaaS plans are pretty reasonably priced.
JupyterHub does not provide version control system nor facilitates sharing of Notebooks. You mentioned yourself limitation of Binder.
In essence, I think it meets all requirements you posted. On top of that it delivers richer visualisation capabilities and plethora of other features (works with Shiro, Knox, Kerberos - secure Spark anyone?). 
With DVC tool you can just share your project by Git, sync data to S3 by a single DVC command. If some of your data scientists decide to change the code at any stage of your project then the final result could be easily reproduced by a single command dvc repro data/target_metrics.txt.
I've recently open sourced a tool which combines code, data, and the dependencies between data and code to a single environment and makes your data science project reproducible: DVC or dataversioncontrol.com (there is a tutorial).
