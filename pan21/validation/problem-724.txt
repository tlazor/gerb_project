Then, download the Microsoft Touch Pack for Windows 7 from the Microsoft Download Center. This will give you some extra touch applications like various games and tools.
If the support is there, I'd expect you to find options to manipulate its behavior in the Control Panel, either as a custom tab in the 'Mouse' applet, or as a complete replacement for it in the form of a 'Touch' or 'Tablet' or 'Pen' kind of applet.
Unfortunately, Windows 7 is not really designed as a touch-centric OS like the iPad. You will not have gestures for everything you might want, but should be able to use gestures in Internet Explorer to browse pages, and should be able to add in handwriting recognition, multitouch zooming, etc. with the tablet PC features.
Make sure you have Windows 7 Home or higher installed on your netbook. Windows 7 Starter doesn't support Windows Touch (Windows 7 different editions comparation)
Make sure that TabletPC features are turned on. If you type features into the start menu, an option for Turn Windows Features On and Off should appear. Locate Tablet PC Components on that list, and check the box to enable them.
