Each client has their own OU within our AD and using denies (ADSIedit) they can't see each other in Exchange and neither as normal objects (like for folder permissions).
Now, I have googled on this, but it doesn't seem this is possible (atleast, natively). We still need to use adsiedit and do tricks to get a multi tenant environment. Regarding Exchange, we thought about using Office 365 for the clients.
While you can't use your ADSIEdit method in Exchange Server 2010 or 2013 you can use the multitenant capability of Exchange Server 2010 or 2013. A far easier solution (and one that I've used with a client with similar needs) is to use Address Book Policies in Exchange Server 2010 or 2013 to provide the separation and isolation that you need.
We currently have the following  environment (hosted on server 2003 and terminals servers on 2008 R2) and we need to upgrade this to their 2012 versions. We will create a new environment from scratch.
I'd like to know if I misunderstood something or if there's anything I'm missing to create a multi tenant 2012 R2 environment.
