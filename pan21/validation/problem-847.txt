i would go with the "Hide icon and notifications" option, and eliminate that extra mouse click by adding a shortcut to launch the program, right click the program's shortcut and add some key combination
What it seems you really want to do is use it to open the program and don't care about notifications. For an equivalent solution, I would try something like this:
If your application "helpfully" remembers the presence of an update from the last time it was able to contact the update server, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the old version with the hosts file blocking in place to prevent it seeing the new download.
Separate answer for a completely different tactic: you can disable balloon notifications for all notification area icons using local Group Policy. As HowToGeek explains,
This should work. I don't know the particular program you are struggling with, but those that I use often will not launch a new instance using this method, but open the existing instance. I believe that the program would have to instruct Windows specifically to not do this, though what mechanism that utilizes and whether this is true at all, is something I am not intimately familiar with.
You haven't told us which program (or even what kind of program it is!), so your mileage may vary, but how about:
I would focus my efforts into disabling update notifications in the application itself. Every application I have seen with an updater has this option.
As mentioned elsewhere, this is not how the Notification area is designed to operate. Notifications are its raison d'être, so being able to turn them off would be counter to the design goals of the system.
If you stated the name of the program someone might have been able to tell you exactly how to achieve this. As it is, all anyone can do is speculate.
I would not recommend this, as Windows occasionally uses these balloons for useful messages (your hard disk is failing, your battery is about to run out, etc.) — disabling the updates for your particular program is a much cleaner solution.
