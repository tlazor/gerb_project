I was wondering if it would be possible to use a program like audacity to produce a sound output that cannot be detected by the human ear but still produces a voltage, or something like that. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
I have a set of water speakers, which I absolutely love, and I'd like to be able to see the water 'dancing' at night with no music. I know that it is possible to physically disconnect the speakers inside, but I'd like to be able to use them as speakers as well sometimes.
Try jiggling the USB wire (unplugging it and plugging it back in again) until the speakers light up but the sound doesn't play. Then turn up the volume until the water dances. Make sure to turn the volume down again when you put the audio back
I'm not sure if I'm asking this in the right place here, so please forgive me if not. It's a bit of a strange one.
You just need to disconnect the speakers from the water part of the device. It is pretty simple and self explanatory. I was also able to find a Video on YouTube for it. Check it out here.
