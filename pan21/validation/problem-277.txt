Eventually got a job programming in a small shop with big customers where all the programmers where linux geeks, so we all sys admin'd a bit too. But I did a LOT of the sys admining and helped run the 10 modem 100 user ISP we had on the side
I started as a sysadmin/dba and then made my way into programming.  I went into the sysadmin/dba arena because I had the misconception that programmers were locked in a back room and never spoke with anyone.  When I started dabbling with programming (VBA --> VB6 --> .NET), I found that I needed to know how the processes worked from the people that did them (imagine that!)
From this I grew into a beginner sys admin. Learnt perl overnight when the passwd file got blown away but we had the data to rebuild it on the file system attributes and a radius file.
I started out as a Sysadmin, and found myself turning into a lazy admin which hated to do the same thing twice, so I learned how to do scripting.  The scripting not only made   mundane tasks easier to do, it also help streamline things my ensuring that all the proper steps were accounted for in a task.  The scripting also got me to the point where I am today where I don't like GUI's, because I don't know what code there executing on the backend and so I don't trust them.  I also followed the natural evolution from scripting into developer work, but because I am a sysadmin at heart and have never had any formal development training any day of my life, I still find myself falling back to sysadmin work.  Honestly in some ways I wish I was laid off, or maybe more appropriately a long vacation (3-4 weeks), so that I could focus more on developing and possibly make the switch from admin to dev.
As a student, I had a part time job as a level one/two/three helpdesk at an ISP when a medium sized ISP here in Australia was 1-2000 users. Was a CS student at the time. Training was, here is the root password and the alarm code. Make sure you lock the door when you leave.
Started as developer. Went through system administration, DBA, back to developer, back to DBA, back to system administration. Now back as DBA. 
From there moved to a deployment engineer role. Where you needed to be able to deploy prod software in a sensible scaleable way but also have enough programming experience to work out how the bespoke software worked and to be able to talk with devs to debug it.
My knowledge of the sysadmin/dba side of things helped me immensely when I started coding because I knew how everything worked and how it should work.  That gave me a huge leg-up on programming solutions for the sysadmin folks!
I worked my way into development and now am a programmer.  Apparently, I was always a programmer at heart because I never feel like I'm working anymore! :-)
I think it's fairly straight forward to go from dev to the other fields. I don't think it is as easy to go from system administration to development. There's a certain mindset to development and enjoying the practice of writing code and building applications. I have found a lot of great system administrators who have had trouble embracing it.
