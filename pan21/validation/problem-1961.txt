If you stop by a photography shop, they'll kit you out with a sturdy, steel brief case with a customizable foam insert that you can cut out to fit your drive(s).  If it's good enough for cameras and lenses, I think it's good enough for HDDs. 
We use external USB drives for backups, and they have to be stored offsite at the end of the week. Right now we have your standard external USB drive inside an enclosure. We were thinking about moving to a USB dock, and dock a bare HDD for backups, rather than having various sized and types of enclosures. If we were to do this, the drives need protection while being transported to/from the safety deposit box.
Is there any kind of hard drive carrier that would let us slide two drives into it, and it would provide protection while the drives are carried around by non-technical people? I'm afraid such a product doesn't exist, but perhaps someone knows of something?
Yes it does- kind of. We use a plastic molded "thing" which the 3.5" Sata hard drive goes into, which gives it some protection. Will look for a link for you now.
Have you tried looking at the different Vaultz cases? I use one for a netbook with a bit of egg-carton foam to fill in gaps and keep things from shifting. works great for protecting things since it's a hard case to prevent bangs and light weather from affecting the contents, and if you cut some foam to fit your contents it should keep things from sliding or banging around.
