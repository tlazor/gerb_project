2) Destroy and rebuild your WMI repository.  To that end, perhaps check out The WMI Diagnosis Utility from Microsoft.
GRC's "Never 10" is designed to straighten-out the messy windows 7 updater, and then disable it's Windows 10 upgrade suggestions.
I have run this app many times with 100% success to fix the 706be error, among others (searching for updates forever is another common one caused by the same thing). If you want Windows 10 later, you can still upgrade it - "Never 10" just disables the automatic pestering.
It was found that even after Microsoft turned off the "nagware", that Steve Gibson's program was still getting downloaded all the time - due to a happy co-incidence that it fixes the dreaded windows installer errors, as part of it's process.
edit: sorry, to answer your direct question as to the cause, without going on a rant: it was caused by a patch to a file, and then a subsequent patch which had the older version of the file, and then the Cumulative-Update-Roundup (a group of several fixes in one patch, like a small service pack) which included both of the previous clashing "fixes". The same thing happened again in Windows 10, unfortunately, you PC was just one of the ones that got caught in the "perfect storm" .
