There is nothing you can do to prevent a system admin from assigning a static IP address to system that may conflict with your own.  And if that machine happens to be in the same vlan as your own box then they will come into conflict (just ask a network guy who has had a user assign their machine the same IP address as the router how much fun that is).  
After convincing the hotline that this was not our mistake (which took some time), they found out that some other server in the same subnet somehow (they didn't explain how) "stole" the public IP of our server (or rather "took precedence").
Question: does this make sense (we are simple developers who don't really know)? And is it possible to prevent such a scenario? Or can anyone in a typical hosting environment simply "steal" another IP, provided s/he knows how to do this?
It also helps to ensure that a server doesn't get a new address on restart, seemingly making the server disappear.
They disconnected the "thief", and for a short period of time we could see our server again. Then, without restart, it happened again! After another hour or so our server was back.
This sounds like user error on the part of another system admin.  If you are using dynamic assignments (DHCP) then permanent leases or reservations can make this less likely to happen.  Your hosting provider could also implement smaller subnets or private vlans to make this less likely to happen.
If we go to the basics, the IP is assigned to a NIC, and the DHCP Server assigns IP's to NIC's.. and NIC's are identified by their MAC addresses..
One possible scenario is when the machines are "Virtual Machines" under VMware or Hyper-V. What people usually do is that they create a Reference machine and clone it as and when people request it. So, typically all hardware settings are copied to the 'cloned' machine too. 
Am I missing something here? Or is everybody missing the fact that it seems you are assigning dynamic addresses (with DHCP) to servers?
We are renting a Windows root server at Serverloft. Recently, when the server restarted after installing regular Microsoft updates, it restarted properly, but couldn't be accessed anymore, and a Linux server was answering instead!
