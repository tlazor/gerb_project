I started thinking that it might be a Trojan or Malware, but neither Norton nor McAfee (which ere both active and up to date on my comp before this started to happen) have found anything suspect on my computer. Not a proof, but I can't be certain.
You can also set it up in "training" mode which will ask you for all the connections being generated from your computer and let you choose a permanent rule (or temporary) for them.
My question is: Do you know of a tool that would be able to track network activity on my computer and would let me know from which process it originates? That would help me figure out if it comes from a legit programme or not.
I have been experiencing this issue for some time now (maybe 1-2 months), and didn't know if it was something from my ISP or my computer, but I have sudden burst of network activity happening in the background, and that severely impacts my online gaming.
What happens is that suddenly, something is downloading a big amount of data, clogging the connection for a few seconds, then everything comes back to normal. And then it happens within the next 10 minutes or so. It is not very regular, and not always with the same intensity.
