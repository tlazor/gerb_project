Now I have a bunch of computers (approximately 20) that I need to operate disk-less for various security reasons. The PCs all have iSCSI Compliant NICs and from the BIOS I was able to connect to the targets and assign the required LUNS ... I removed the HDDs, ran a fresh windows 10 installation and all went well until it was time to reboot. I removed the installation USB,rebooted, the BIOS connected the iSCSI target, Windows started loading, then after 3 mins of the Windows icon and just the loading circle I got an error message saying BOOT_DEVICE_INACCESSIBLE. Can someone please tell me what to do in that particular situation ? I believe that Windows has already passed the boot loader stage and the OS itself should be loading, I dont know why its still looking for a boot device. If the actual boot device was missing (since its disk-less, and no installation media) then it should get stuck in BIOS and NOT during the OS loading. 
First, We have a regular campus environment ... various windows clients and departments and vlans and Active Directory, NPS, you know the drill.
I was rather expecting the iSCSI SAN Configuration in the BIOS to Support VLANS, the option is there (HP Compaq 6200 pro sff) but disable. Does this mean that I will have to run the SAN traffic and User Traffic all on the same VLAN ? This is going to be a huge problem as the machine changes ip address frequently from User VLAN to Service VLAN (upon user login and logoff with 802.1x AAA on a catalyst Switch). Or will the original native vlan be abstracted from the OS (since its used by the PC hardware) and later will be presented with the option to configure another vlan (encapsulated) for user data from within Windows? Am I better off just adding an extra NIC for data and have a dedicated Layer 1 Interface for SAN ? ... Please Advise !!
