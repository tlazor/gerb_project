I strongly advocate Agile for gaming. It's the best. Based on that, I would say release now, and keep continuously improving it. (But the down-side is that people may get upset if you need to do things like resetting points/experience.)
So the root question is, is it better to release to the world after everything is "done" (potentially years) or after it is "playable", but lacking?
Provided you've got enough of the game finished (core feature are done, no major glaring bugs, enough content to get a feel for the game), then I would suggest releasing it to the public in the "playable but lacking" state.  You'll be able to get feedback, and possibly find additional bugs from multiple users playing.  The feedback is the most important.  Not only does it help you with ideas on what to add to the game, it can help motivate you to keep working on the game.
My question is what should my game have before I allow the public to play. I have several thoughts and would appreciate suggestions as well as other thoughts.
This also gives you crucial early feedback, which may surprise you and provoke you to completely change the direction of your game -- for the better. You won't know until players get their hands on it, though.
In agile, work is broken down into small pieces that make sense if the game was released right away. So make sure you do it right.
I am working on a hobby game that is played in the browser (not flash). It is a sort of civilization simulator. It is a pretty substantial sized game that I hope one day has many players.
A something to keep in mind when you open the game up to the public: responding quickly to bug reports and having a level head when responding to criticism will help build a community for the game.  Good luck!
