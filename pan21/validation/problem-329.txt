I would say, forget about the hardware cost and focus on the development cost.  It will cost you far more to develop the MMORPG than it will to get a database that can handle an MMORPG.
To understand where I'm coming from, consider this:  Why would you need to do two updates per request?  If you're developing an MMORPG, you're going to have 99% reading and maybe 1% updating.
So, if you have one user performing an update every 30 seconds, then you don't have that many updates.  If you're going to try to host, say, 100,000 live connections, your biggest concern is not the database, but the hardware to support 100,000 connections, the RAM to run the server software, the hard drive space to store all the data, etc...
For example, when a player moves from A to B, you will want to report that to the server, and send that to all other clients within a given range.  Ultimately, yes, you will want to save that in your database, but I would only update the database every 5-30 seconds with the users location.  If the server software crashes, the users will log back in having only lost 30 seconds of activity.  That's pretty good.
One million requests per second?  With two row updates per request?  I think the problem isn't the database, but the development!
