Be warned that the transition into 3D graphics from 2D is much more difficult than the transition into 2D graphics initially. It is much more important to understand the fundamental mathematics involved in 3D graphics, lest you end up breaking your code in ways that won't seem to obvious. I would recommend you familiarize yourself with basic linear algebra, matrices and vectors. If you have the resources, purchasing the books "A Geometry Toolbox" and/or "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, 3rd Ed," would be great.
Blender can indeed export a variety of formats -- there is no such thing as the "best" choice here, as all options have pros and cons. Some, however, have more of one or the other. Starting out, I would recommend you try to parse and load the .obj file format. It's very straightforward, and you should be able to find a variety of example code and tutorials online to help you load it if you get stuck. 
If you prefer to avoid writing the loaders yourself, you can use a 3rd party library like the Open Asset Importer Library.
That said, it sounds like the crux of your specific question has to do with loading 3D models. You won't really be able to adapt your existing texture loading function for that purpose (although you will still find texture loading useful when you want to apply textures to your models).
