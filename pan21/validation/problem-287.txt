While not as easy as a desktop, most modern laptops are not all that hard to work on or fragile. If you're still worried, its a 10 minute job for any decent tech.
I have a Dell Inspiron 14R 5421, which I got in April 2013. Recently while turning on the laptop, a message would appear: "Internal hard disk not found, to resolve this issue try to reseat the drive." I don't really do that because I'm afraid i might ruin something inside, considering this is a 4 year old laptop. I've read somewhere that disabling secure boot mode solves this issue. How do I solve this issue? thanks
If it worked before, its probably not secureboot. If the system tells you to  reseat the drive, its a good idea to try. I've done hard drive replacements a few times without a service manual and its not rocket surgery. Besides the computer is telling you do do this. It isn't that dangerous. 
Just grab a copy of the owner's manual from dell. Its a pretty trivial process, and the manual covers removing the cover, and the hard drive tray,as well as replacing them. Reseat the drive as instructed.  If its still not detected, try the hard drive elsewhere to see if its really dead, and replace it if needed.
