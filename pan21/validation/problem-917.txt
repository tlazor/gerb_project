Select, e.g., the text 'TBD1', and then add a bookmark. (On the Insert tab, click Bookmark, and enter a name; TBD1 is a good choice.) 
I need to create a list or table of TBD (To Be Defined) and TBC (To Be Confirmed) items in Microsoft Word. Usage would be as follows:
Or, if you want the reference to look like a clickable link, you can insert a hyperlink. (On the Insert tab, click Hyperlink, click Place in This Document, and then select the bookmark.) The caveat here is that this approach inserts the exact name of the bookmark, not the text of it; however, if you make those 2 values identical (e.g., 'TBD1'), as you can easily get away with for your scenario, it amounts to the same thing.

Then to create the entries in the Item ID column of your table, you can insert a cross-reference to the bookmark. (On the Insert tab, click Cross-reference, select Bookmark in the Reference type field and Bookmark text in the Insert reference to field, either select or clear the Insert as hyperlink check box, and then select the bookmark.) The exact text that you selected when you added the bookmark will be inserted. 
I'm happy if I can just have some way to manually tag TBCs and TBDs, and that I can insert manually the references in the tables, but so that the back reference is kept.
