I did a little search online and found nothing but a somewhat out-dated linux loader - loadlin.exe, which one could run from within Dos or Windows 95/98 to boot Linux. So at least the concept of switching OSes without rebooting is not new. Anyone know of a current tool that does this?
So I was wondering if it is possible to skip these initializations and just "return" to GRUB once I have booted Linux. Ideally I would also be able to do the same from within Windows but my hope is not very high there :)
UPDATE: A friend of mine just told me about Kexec. Using that it seems to be possible to start a different Linux kernel from within a running kernel, but is it possible to go back to GRUB or start a windows installation directly?
I am dual-booting Windows and Linux on my SSD and find myself often switching between the two OSes. The SSD is really fast and both OSes boot in about 3 seconds once selected in GRUB. However, it takes forever (about 30 seconds) for my BIOS, RAID and second SATA controller to initialize before I'm finally in GRUB.
If not, is there a technical issue that prevents us from writing such a program or is there simply not enough demand?
