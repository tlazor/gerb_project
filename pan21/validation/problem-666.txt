PWsvr.exe was working perfectly until today, after I installed a fileZilla server, PHP, IIS7, and VC Redistributable pack 2010 and 2012. Since the redistributable packs contain versions of these DLL files I'm thinking they may have caused the problem. I have tried uninstalling these packs and reinstalling VC Redistributable 2005, but that has not solved the problem. I am now at a loss for what is causing this program to malfunction. My company relies on this program for its day to day operations so I would be very grateful for anyone who would be able to help solve this problem.
If not, install a fresh copy of 2008 on another machine, update it, then install the pwsvr application. Ensure it works, then locate the DLLs you need on that system and move it to the pwsrv program directory on the original system.
Recently one of the programs on my server (PWsvr.exe) has stopped working. I opened the program in dependency walker to see if it is missing any required files, and dependency Walker said that GPSVC.dll, IESHIMS.DLL, MF.DLL, MFPLAT.DLL, and MFREADWRITE.DLL are missing.
