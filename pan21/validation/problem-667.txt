Most other programming jobs either have fewer domain-specific requirements (eg. I used to work in geographical information systems, but the amount I needed to know about map projections and the like could be picked up in a day) or are less able to rely on applicants to be self-motivated and thus have to provide the training. Games development is very heavily domain specific and has an army of self-motivated people eager to break into the industry.
If you are interested in those other areas, you will likely need to dedicate time to learning them on your own -- at least a little bit.
There isn't a typical career path, per se; that would imply a lot more structure to the industry than actually exists. However, as a programmer, without specific experience in programming in areas for games (graphics, physics, et cetera) one can be expected to get hired as an entry level programmer -- perhaps as a general "gameplay" programmer.
In theory, yes. In practice, no. Nobody is going to pay you to learn this stuff because for every one person in your position, there are fifty of equivalent experience who are teaching themselves these skills in their spare time with a view to presenting a demo to prospective employers.
N.B. that 3D modelling is not typically a task performed by programmers at all, and while programmers may employ some scripting in their day-to-day jobs, it's not their primary function (designers tend to do a lot more with scripting languages, if the game uses them).
If you want to work in the games industry as a programmer, make a game demo.. I can not stress enough how much one of these will increase your chances if you do not want to go to a school for game development.
If however you are more interested in level and environment development, this is what designers do. You may want to get an existing engine (Unreal?) and make up a level if that is the sort of work you are after as opposed to a programming job. (I mention this because of your mentioning of scripting vs programming)
In my experience, there are no routes into game programming that allow you to learn on the job. You must demonstrate your suitability for the role before applying, usually with a combination of an academic qualification and a collection of code samples.
