There are two steps to doing this. Firstly you need to set a font that supports hebrew charectors as an availible font for the command prompt. To do so, open regedit and browse to this registry key:
You need to create a new string value, called 00, with a value of the name of the font you want to use. If you already have a 00 entry in their, use 000 and so on.
Once done, restart the machine. You should now be able to click on the upper left corner and your font list should now include the font you wish to use.
In the command-prompt you can click on the upper-left corner icon to choose Properties.  In those screens is a Font choice but on my system it is limited to 2 fonts.  
While many of than answers will change the font, it might also be helpfult to be able to type in those filenames should you decide to do something with them.  For windows XP you need to install the MUI pack.  MUI packs are generally availalable to enterprise agreement customers
I need to set the font on the XP command prompt on a few machines so that it would correctly display Hebrew file names. The default font displays a lot of gibberish, so I'm pretty sure changing it will do the trick. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
