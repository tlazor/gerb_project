On a desktop computer (Mac OS or Windows) the location of the files can be obtained with the following code:-
For more information have a look into http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/StreamingAssets.html.
To actually copy some files into your app, use StreamingAssets folder (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-streamingAssetsPath.html). This folder is simply copied into resulting build, so you can use files in it like normal OS files, including, I suppose, opening them in Safari (I don't know, maybe some iOS quirks can still prevent you from doing that. It definitely works on desktop).
Any files placed in a folder called StreamingAssets in a Unity project will be copied verbatim to a particular folder on the target machine. You can retrieve the folder using the Application.streamingAssetsPath property. For reference, the location of this folder varies per platform:
If this is not possible, is there an alternative way I can load a locally stored website on an iOS device?
It's always best to use http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-streamingAssetsPath.html to get the location of the StreamingAssets folder, it will always point to the correct location on the platform where the application is running. 
Yes you can, but you're using wrong folder. The Resources folder is not copied with your build; rather, it is compressed into a single file cotaining all assets from the folder.
