I suspect that when I reinstalled the ssh client the sshd server was uninstalled and the result is - no login.
I'd recommend trying it first on the local machine -- it will make debugging easier. Only when you are sure all elements work, do it on the remote host.
There could be ways to log in to your server, but these are methods that are not discussed here I think ( containing php shells , connectback shell etc...). 
If that doesn't fix the problem then boot your system into recovery mode (if you can) and take a look at your logs and the sshd configuration file to see if they can help narrow down the problem.
and if I execute it in my local machine terminal it's working and it try to install sshd, but when I try to run it with php with:
I have a vps and I tried to use svn, but it fauls badly. I found in one site that the problem disappears if you reinstall ssh client and I did it. And while I was on the server the problem has been fixed.
Could you give me any advice how to solve that problem. It look like I need to turn into a hacker :)
The whole trick hinges on ability of being able to FTP remotely as root to a non-chrooted environment (which is not the way I'd recommend to configure FTP server).
it return nothing. I've tried with ls -la but the result is the same - on terminal it's ok, but from PHP it doesn't work.
What I have is FTP as well as PHP and I know root password. Is there any way I can install the openssh-server agan?
