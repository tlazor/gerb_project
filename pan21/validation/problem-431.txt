This is just a guess. On the other hand, what you report is a well-known common problem, and no other explanation has ever been suggested.
The interesting thing is, as I started the system USB devices did not respond. Both keyboard and mouse were working fine in BIOS, but Windows somehow ignored them (despite USB ports being still powered up).
When you can't boot from the required disk, the BIOS followed the search order and booted from the next available boot device.  In doing so, it enumerated USB boot devices.  Having captured USB controllers/boot devices, it did not correctly release or re-init them for Windows.
I'm not sure if this helps, but I had issues with IOMMU and USB 3.0 when I switched from using Windows as my main OS to Ubuntu/Linux. You should also note that if you are having issues with USB 3.0 ports, the '3.0' might be the issue, as USB 3.0 is known to go out frequently.
It could be that you did not reconfigure the bios when you mis-organised your physical setup. Bios'es aren't as smart as you might think. Actually, I think the simpler they make the built-in bios software, the more secure it is, since there is less code to go wrong at the lowest level of a computer.
After changing one HDD I accidentally connected my hard drives in reverse order, so non-system HDD became master and SSD with the system became slave.
BIOS took in the slave's ISO and used it to run the master. the path configuration of the drivers were not found which ignored USB devices.
