Best Practices for Implementing a Microsoft PKI - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772670(WS.10).aspx
Encrypting e-mail with Outlook 2007 (assumes your PKI is already set up) - http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HP012305361033.aspx
Lotus Notes is from security standpoint a very good product. You can have mail encrypted all the way to server disk, even administrator can't read user's mail.
If you aren't opposed to spending money. The PGP Universal server isn't a bad idea. We've been running it for years now. It also is doing well as a virtual for the past 8 months.
You can employ a Microsoft Public Key Infrastructure/Cert Authority for free if you are running a server OS like Win 2003 (which I see that you are if you are using Exchange).  It integrates very well with Active Directory (if you are running that also).  Users can grab certs from the CA and encrypt their e-mail with it on an as-needed basis.  Exchanging encrypted e-mail within the same domain is no problem as the users will trust the CA inherently and have access to the public key for decryption.  If you are sending encrypted e-mail outside the domain, you will need the receiving party's public key so you can encrypt e-mail sent to them with it.  This ensures that they are the only recipient who can read it.  The reverse is true for receiving encrypted e-mail from outside the domain.  I am sorry I don't have any suggestions for secure storage of e-mail though...
It integrates to some extent with MS Office on Windows at least, is in some ways strange and ugly but it works quite ok and has wonderful replication options (think always backed up and everything available online if you want).
