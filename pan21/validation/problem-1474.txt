Presumably what you've got is actually the BSSID of the router: this is router's "inside" MAC address.  Unless you can connect to the WiFi network, there is no reliable way to get the router's external IP address.  That said, many home routers have an external MAC address that is either one greater or one less than the BSSID.  For example, if the BSSID is 68:05:E7:02:7B:66, the external MAC is probably either 68:05:E7:02:7B:67 or 68:05:E7:02:7B:65.  
DHCP is dynamic IP so every time you turned on the lap,it would be assigned with different IP and also noted that it would be connected to WiFi connection at a time so it would catches the strong signal near your room.You can use the following url  
I assume you don't have access to DHCP logs, switch management consoles, or any other network infrastructure.  In this situation, there's no easy way to turn a MAC address into an IP address: ARP only goes the other direction.  Instead, you need to do ARP resolution of each IP address on the network until you find the one with the MAC address you're looking for.  Linux provides tools such as "arp" and "arping" to do this; I presume Windows has similar tools.
