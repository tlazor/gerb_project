people usually do what you're talking about (load balancing) with multiple real, physical machines - each one having its own CPU(s) and RAM, as well as disk and network bandwidth.  doing it on VMs would defeat the purpose of that.
regardless of whether it's possible or not (I'm sure it is - that's what VMs are for), what makes you think that adding the overhead of running extra virtual machines (not to mention disk contention as the VMs fight to access different copies of the same files) will somehow be faster than just the one main server?
the advantages of VMs is that they allow you to consolidate several physical machines into one bigger one (saving money and power) AND that you can get a nice degree of isolation from one VM to another (good for security and to prevent one berserk process from taking down everything else).   they're also good for experimentation and trying out new/changed things before implementing them for real.  and being able to take a snapshot of a VM just before you upgrade it is also useful.  and so on.  the uses and benefits of VMs are many, but improving performance isn't one of them.
