Because of wear leveling in flash storage devices (like SSD), in order to be certain of overwriting a deallocated block you'd need to write all unallocated flash storage blocks.  Unfortunately, even doing the overwrite before deleting the file would require overwriting every single block not part of other files, because each write may land anywhere on the entire storage device as part of the wear leveling process.  That means that in order to securely erase by overwriting, you effectively need to overwrite all space on the device not already part of other files outside the flash storage block(s) occupied by the file to be deleted, and even then you can't be certain you've overwritten the block that originally held the file in question, if there are other files (or fragments of them) in the same flash storage block.
Because of this, SSD (or flash storage in any form) is a bad choice for storing data that may need to be securely erased short of physical destruction of the device; stick with optical media which can be shredded, or magnetic storage that's amenable to mil-spec erasure with multiple pattern and random overwrites (and where data stays where it was so you can be sure it's been overwritten).  If you must use flash media, I'd suggest the smallest capacity SD or thumb drive that will hold what you need, along with a reliable method to avoid physical loss of the storage device.  That will both simplify the "overwrite the whole device" requirement for secure deletion, and reduce the cost of physical destruction of the device for absolutely certain deletion security.
