ext4 is the default filesystem format in Ubuntu 18.04, but Windows is expecting a partition that is formatted as NTFS. Otherwise the Windows installer will stop and not continue, because it does not recognize your laptop's ext4 formatted hard drive. To solve this problem boot the laptop from the live DVD/USB that you used to install Ubuntu 18.04. You may need to set the USB flash drive as first in the boot sequence in the BIOS, so your laptop will be able to boot from it. Open the built-in GParted partition editor application, and create an NTFS partition for Windows 7.
Now your laptop is ready to install Windows. When you boot the Windows 7 installer after creating an NTFS partition, the Windows installer will recognize it and the Windows 7 installation will proceed normally.
I bought a laptop HP 8460p which already have pre installed windows 10, then I install ubuntu 18.04 by create a root partition on ext4, However I had some bios issue therefore I sent it for repair when its came back the both OS were deleted, Now I tried to install windows on the laptop but when its come on partition select page it says "Cannot install windows on this partition" I tried several ways like gparted or make an windows ISO by GPT but nothing works.
Now the situation is I have 128GB SSD hard drive which have only one root partition and ultemately only have ubuntu on it. Please help me to get back my laptop on dual boot and install windows properply.
