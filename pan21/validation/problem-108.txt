So, from my experience I'd say moving-whilst-running is no problem (or at least enough to warrant avoiding it), but wrapping it is a no-go.
I regularly run around with my laptop awake, sometimes even when it's crunching somewhat intensive physics simulations. My current laptop (a cheap Asus R301L) has survived this without any problems for more than three years. The SSD certainly makes me more confident about this (IMO, an SSD is the only sensible internal storage medium for a laptop anyway nowadays). Of course, I still try to be as gentle as feasibly possible, and I don't put it in a bag that covers the fan openings.
With my old laptop, I also used to keep it on. That one failed me after 2 Â½ years. I suspect this was in part because I sometimes did pack it in the bag; a couple of times this caused thermal shutdown. The hard disk, interestingly, never failed, even after I once dropped the laptop whilst running (onto a carpet). I put the HD in an external casing after the laptop died, and I still use it.
In a bag a running laptop can definitely get too hot, even while idle. I will carry a machine around for brief periods of time in a bag while running (think using the restroom) but would never do so for a long time or if it were not somewhat attended. Modern hardware will protect itself from thermal damage pretty well though.
Independent of all this, of course always make sure you have good backups of all data, because both hard disks and flash memory can fail spontaneously without any environment reason.
The only really fragile moving part in a laptop is the hard disk drive. This is mostly because the heads can strike the platters, and there are many anecdotes of this sort of damage. Some laptops have freefall protection that will park the heads during a fall, but this is software mediated and can be disable/not work.
Many modern machines do not have magnetic hard drives at all, but instead have an SSD. These have no moving parts and present zero risk to move while running. Does your laptop have an SSD? If not, and portability while running is important (or performance in general) this would be an excellent upgrade.
