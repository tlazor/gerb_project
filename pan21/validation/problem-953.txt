Then you can take action (either ban the cheater, or ban who forged the false report). To check yourself if that submission is really invalid or not you can use a special client or whatever.
Your game is singleplayer, the only 'interaction' with the other players is a leaderbord. You could spawn an instance to check a simulation on your server for each submission, you don't need all the tricks of making sure physics are the same over 30 clients, so I don't think you need more resources than you have already since the physics are already working :).
I don't know if your simulation is like, set up and don't interact (easy to check) or if players can interact with the sim while it is running, but be sure to do your physics in such a way that different floating point representations don't mess stuff up and make a valid run look invalid .
You can validate client-side the submissions of other users, and have the client report to the server if a submission looks invalid.
Checking every result is gonna be a bit overkill, you could send the simulation compressed to the server whenever someone sends a score to the leaderbord, then only check the top 5% scores on your own server, or maybe even the top 1% or even smarter only check new highscores and assume everyone not better than #1 probably has a non-cheated simulation.
As Daniel stated, the big issue here is going to be programs which perform the action for the player; no in-game physics skewing would be necessary if the player was robotic arm with precision normally resolved for neurosurgery.
