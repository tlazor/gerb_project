Does anybody know an easy way to find out the model number of my wireless adapter, or, a generic wireless adapter driver?

The only information I know how to provide at the moment, is that I bought it from ebay via this link, which does not specify the brand or manufacturer either. 
I swear the god that I am not advertising for this seller or product. I am just trying to provide more information. I would appreciate any advice on how to retrieve the information on my adapter. 
I lost the CD with driver to my USB wireless adapter and Ubuntu does not recognize my adapter. The sad thing is, I don't even know the manufacturer or brand of my adapter. It is just a small little device with nothing printing on it (It does work on my Windows, which I installed the driver while I still had the CD).
