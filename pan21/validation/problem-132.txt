Basically, an attacker is sending packets with forged source addresses to your DNS server. They're asking it questions that will result in it sending large responses. To use your DNS server as an attack tool the attacker is spoofing the source address of a host that they want to flood with garbage traffic and directing large numbers of DNS servers, just like yours, to bombard that host with bogus responses. Your DNS server isn't compromised or doing anything wrong, per se, but you shouldn't allow your DNS server to send these large responses to arbitrary questions to the Internet.
I just received an email from my website internet provider that my server has been "involved as open resolvers in DDoS attacks (DNS Reflection) over the past few weeks."
You can't identify the origin of the attack-- the packets your DNS server is receiving are from spoofed source addresses.
Basically, you need to reconfigure your DNS server not to provide recursive resolution services to the Internet. Your DNS server should answer requests only for the domains it is authoritative for.
