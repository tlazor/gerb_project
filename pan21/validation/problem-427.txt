I am a software developer.  My company is planning to take advantage of visualization and host its servers at a data center.  I understand the difference between the cloud and self hosting at a data centre.  I have read a few articles e.g.this one: http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4982-cloud-vs-data-center.html, which talks about cloud hosting v data centre hosting.
Both options are available, but generally speaking, if you're getting space in a data center, you're doing it in order to put your own gear in - this is referred to as "colocation".
I have discovered that my company has recently invested heavily in hardware and is installing it at the data centre next week.  I thought the purpose of a data centre was to "rent" hardware that already exists.  Are you expected to buy your own servers and install them yourself?
If you're getting a service where you're not dealing with the physical infrastructure, you probably don't care about where that physical infrastructure resides (so it's probably not all sitting in a rack or cage in the datacenter dedicated to your company).  These kinds of services fall under the umbrella of "managed services", or various "something-as-a-service" offerings, or, indeed, "cloud".
It sounds like your company is getting colocation space, so your company responsible for the hardware, while the host will provide power and cooling (and potentially the internet uplink).
Your company is likely using a colocation (colo) center.  The difference with a colo being the physical equipment resides in in a building that is not your own.  With a colo your equipment would be racked in secure sections, separate from other customers'.  They would provide power, network connectivity (depends), cooling, physical security.  Each center is different and the terms of these agreements should be fully understood.  
The "cloud" is essentially hosting on equipment/servers that you do not own, in a location you don't.  There's more to it an you can rent dedicated equipment, but this is the basic idea.
