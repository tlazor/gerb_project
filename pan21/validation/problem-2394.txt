There was a piece of paper taped on the router with a link to an owner's manual; however, the link didn't seem to get me any helpful information regarding setup or anything. So this is my issue... I have connected this thing to my modem and attempted to run it a few times, my iPod typically recognizes it, but it doesn't work from there (it doesn't require a password, marks that I have connected but I can't access the internet).
So, my question is this... What do I need to do to set this device up? Was there a disk with drivers that I needed? I own two other routers - I've had this same issue with one of those - and the one (which I didn't set up either) works flawlessly. What am I missing?
P.S. I will have additional router details soon, I do not have access to it at this time. I will also include the link that I was given. 
I recently purchased a LinkSys router from a local resale shop. It appears to be an older model and the only things it came with were a power supply and Ethernet cable (no manuals or any such).
