You can authenticate the user or the PC. If it is the PC, it is connected to the network without any prompted information. You can access to it if noone is connected on it. You need to check the authentication method on the network panel.
In our company we deployed 802.1x using EAP-TLS with Machine Certificates. The certificate used for the authentication is installed in the computer store. That means we can still manage the device even when the user is logged off in the wired or wireless network. If we would have used user certificates or any other user based authentication that wouldn't have been possible.
With 802.1x enabled, would it be possible to push patches out to the Windows PCs and perform security scans on them while nobody's logged in to them?  My understanding about 802.1x is that the PCs will be denied network access until a user authenticates. If that's the case, then I wouldn't even be able to ping the PCs, let alone patch and scan them, right? Any agents running on the PCs also would not be able to get out on the network unless a user is logged in.
I'm researching the feasibility of implementing 802.1x port security on my wired network. The supplicants will be Windows 7 PCs. The authenticator will be Cisco and Juniper switches. I'm thinking about using PacketFence as the authentication server.
Am I understanding this correctly, or is there some way to have 802.1x and still manage the PCs remotely when a user is not logged on?
