In other words, your best "solution" will be to simply wait for official drivers from Acer, specifically made for windows 8. Oh, and trying to use win 7 versions didn't work either, so just wait.
I am very disappointed with AMD graphics, at least mobile versions, and i doubt i will ever get an AMD gpu again. Besides, the HP drivers are not the latest, and i don't expect for them to update them soon again. But at least now they work.
I had the same problem with an HP laptop, also with AMD graphics, and I'm afraid that, in my case, the only "solution" was to wait for official graphics drivers made for windows 8, because all of the AMD drivers needed to either disable switchable graphics, or made the Catalyst Control Center not to work at all.
Another more complicated option, is to use the popular "Leshcat / Unifl" drivers, which are custom and unofficial, but they may work for you. Just be careful and read the instructions carefully. More info here, and here for instructions. Lots of people have find them very useful and it may be your solution if Acer doesn't do they work and give you proper drivers.
I in fact tried them, and they worked fine (at least much better than the win 7 versions I had), but when the official drivers from HP got out, i just switched back to them.
