I did now a lot of exploration trough all those websites, but I didn't get a clear statement. I also wrote HighPoint, VMWare and two shops selling this controller, but none of them answered me so far. 
Because an Sata SSD Raid Controller costs also very much, I thought about an M.2 Raid Controller, but it actually looks like there's not much selection, espacially for older systems like mine.
So I decided to check if the P410i can handle 4 or 5 TB Sata drives, like the Seagate BarraCuda, and us it and the hot swap for this usage. (Does someone already made experience with such big drives and the P410i controller?)
Yeah, you probably ask, why I want to go such an big upgrade, but in my opinion it's not much more exspensive than all the other option I have and on the other hand side, I planning to upgrade the ML370 to an ML350 G8 or so at summer, and shut down three physical PCs while replacing them with Thin Clients. 
But I saw there the HighPoint SSD7101A-1, which actually does look like an solid Raid Controller for m.2 SSDs.
I have an ML370 G* 6server, and planming now, to go for an storage upgrade. After an first evaluation, I came to the conclusion, that it wouldn't make sense, to use SSDs with the P410i.
So I thought, I ask here, eventually someone had already tried it. Or at least, you guys can name me an good option.
