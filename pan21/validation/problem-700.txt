And as I side note: When I do get my computer to boot, it says my hardware has changed and I have to re-activate windows. But it says I have to call Microsoft to do it. So I get this fancy automated voice that asks me to enter in a code into windows, then it asks me "How many computers have you activated with this copy of Windows?". Well, I had it on my computer before I replaced everything, so I said 1. Then he yelled at me for violating my 1-use license. I dunno what's going on there, do I have to re-purchase Windows 7? And they wonder why people pirate software... That's just a bonus question, though.
Clear the CMOS settings. What's happening is that you have some setting that's preventing the system from POSTing. When the motherboard detects a few failed POSTs, it tries POSTing with default settings, which then works.
Clearing the CMOS wouldn't make Windows require activation.  Changing a sound card wouldn't do it either.  Even changing a sound card and video card at the same time.  Changing a motherboard can trigger that "different hardware" dealio (although not necessarily... I've managed it more than once with the right mobo swap).  So, if this message is the one you get after you replaced the motherboard, that's most likely why you got it.
I have a custom built PC that is exhibiting some...odd... behavior, something I've never seen before. It was working fine one day, and the next day, it wouldn't start. Seeing as I wanted an upgrade anyway, I purchased a new motherboard that was compatible with all my parts. While replacing the motherboard, I accidentally damaged the CPU. Well, I wanted a new one anyway... so I got a new one. Seeing as I was replacing a ton of parts already, I bought a new PSU because the old one was super loud. When I slapped it all together, it starts up, lights, fans, drives, they all start. But I get no display from the monitor. No beeps, which I believe means it doesn't POST. I figured it was the RAM, because after removing the sound card and graphics card, there was nothing else that I hadn't replaced. When I remove both sticks of RAM, I get a continuous beeping, and according to the mobo handbook, means no RAM. So I think the mobo is functional, or atleast partly. I bought new RAM, but it still didn't work. I tried 3 monitors, with both VGA and DIV. So it's probably not the monitor, either.
How, exactly?  I ask, because is it possible you damaged the motherboard?  As in... damaged a capacitor?  Because the behavior you are describing sounds like a power issue, and not necessarily a PSU issue... which could and would indicate a potential capacitor issue.  I've known more than one motherboard to operate with blown capacitors... just not reliably.  I'm not saying that you blew one... but if it was damaged... that could explain things.
Now, let me get to the random part. Every 20 or so boots (I should also mention, for about 3 out of 5 boots I have to unplug the PC because it won't powerdown via the button), it will POST and I'll get display. Then, after about 2 or 3 resets, it won't work again. This confuses me so much, because even when I change nothing, it will/will not work. My thought is that maybe it has something to do with the RAM not clearing or something. I also reset the CMOS battery, incase that had anything to do with it, but no eval. I found some weird suggestion online about holding the power button for 30 seconds while it was unplugged. That did nothing, but I didn't expect it would...
I've replaced just about the entire computer, and all the parts are compatible. Done about everything I can think of, but nothing has worked. Hopefully someone can help me here.
You need to reload your opp. if you change motherboards. Reload the operating system with the new motherboard in and it should work fine.
Most likely, you customized some settings for your old RAM and forgot to remove them before you switched to the new RAM.
