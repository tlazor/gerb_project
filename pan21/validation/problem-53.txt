Think of encryption as an adapter. The data is simply encoded before being written or decoded before being read. The only difference is that a key is passed at some point (usually when the drive/driver is initialized) to be used for the encryption/decryption.
The actual location of the encryption module can vary; it can be a software driver or it can be a hardware module in the system (e.g., controller, BIOS, TPM module), or even in the drive itself. In any case, the module is “in the middle of the wire” between the software that performs the file operations and the actual data on the drive’s platters.
If you simply mean that all files and filesystem metadata are encrypted on the disk, then no, it should have no impact on SSD lifespan.
As you can see, there is no need to perform extra reads or writes because the encryption module encrypts the data before the data is written to the platters and decrypts it before it is sent to the process that performed the read.
SSD devices use "wear levelling" to spread the writes across the device so as to avoid wearing out a few sections prematurely.  They can do this because modern filesystem drivers specifically tell the SSD when the data in a particular sector is no longer being used (has been "discard"ed), so then the SSD can set that sector back to zero and proceed to use whatever sector has the least amount of use for the next write.
I would assume that a full-disk encryption deployment would introduce additional writes each time the computer is booted up and shut down. Given that solid state disks are considered to have a lower average capacity for writes before failure, can a full-disk encryption solution lower the expected lifetime of the disk on which it is deployed?
With a traditional, full-disk encryption scheme, none of the sectors are unused.  The ones that do not contain your data are still encrypted.  That way an attacker doesn't know what part of your disk has your data, and what part is just random noise, thereby making decryption much more difficult.
However, if you mean a more traditional "The entire contents of the disk, including unused space, is encrypted" then yes, it will reduce the lifespan, perhaps significantly.
