If you send using your email address as the From and To and you authenticate to google, you are essentially emailing yourself and I think this skips authentication checks. 
In this scenario, if you have a contact form and it's emailing you and the submitter, your server creates the email but sends it using SMTP with your external provider. The TXT SPF record authorizes sending on behalf of your domain. The MX record pointing at Google Apps means email replies do not hit your server.
I would like to see the code you're using on your contact form that sends the email. A lot of people use the "From" address of the person filling out the email. 
The article recommends a workaround - but a more clever way I think would be to set the "reply-to" as the email address of the person filling out the contact us form. 
The TXT SPF record has to specify the IP of servers authorized to send mail on behalf of a given domain. The obvious solution is to use a different server to send email, not your web server.
The easiest way to do this is to use an external SMTP provider - in the past I've used AuthSMTP, but I'm sure there are many available.
Also if you setup your contact form with a third party transnational email provider like Formspree you're still not good to go because if you DMARC policy is set to p=reject all those other emails that the server is sending to you (not through the contact form), but on reebot, fail2ban restart, etc. from root, www-data, fail2ban and other server users, they will be all rejected.
Lindqvist's solutions were fine but if you whitelist your own server on the recipient side (in Google Apps, not through SPF) and at the same time you set DMARC policy with p=reject the emails your server is sending to you will be rejected no matter the whitelisting with filters in Google Apps.
I believe I found the most appropriate solution given all the caveats and constrains in this given scenario.
The solution is to setup a DKIM on your server so at least one of the conditions will be fulfilled. The emails from your server will still softfail on SPF (you don't have your server's IP there) but they will pass on DKIM and that's enough for DMARC to pass.
If you are hiding your servers behind a proxy solution, as described in your question, you will indeed ruin that by publishing the addresses of your servers or even just making outbound connections to untrusted parties.
When that happens, you open yourself up to a complete nightmare scenario when using Google. If the person sending the email has DMARC turned on. You're SPF might pass (but it won't be aligned).
