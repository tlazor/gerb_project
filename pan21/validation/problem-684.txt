Subsequent attempts at sudo apt-get upgrade and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade resulted in no packages being upgraded or installed.
dist-upgrade will (un)install dependencies as needed. As far as I know, it’s equivalent to install [list of all explicitly installed pkgs] (but there may be differences). This is good, dependencies are bound to change, and you want your system to reflect that, obviously.
As for packages being held back: This probably due to (at the moment) unresolvable dependencies, but should go away once those deps are available.
Occasionally, my Raspbmc upgrades itself, downloading and installing new kernels and xbmc. How would I keep the other packages up-to-date?
Assuming you don’t use your Pi for mission-critical stuff, dist-upgrade does exactly what you want, so you’re good. There’s no need to run both, by the way, because d-u will do what u does and more.
I'm not sure if it's recommended, but I tried sudo apt-get upgrade followed by sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. It seems like some packages are put on hold, although surprisingly, others were still uninstalled. Should I not have run these commands?
upgrade will never alter which packages are installed, it will only update those that are installed to the latest version it can. It will not upgrade a package if that would require installing new dependencies, and it will not remove unnecessary packages.
