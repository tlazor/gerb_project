You could put in 100 levels to get X hours of gameplay, but if it is you who is testing (you the programmer who knows the game's algorithms and quirks, you the gamer who is already an expert with the controls, you the designer who knows the level design and shortcuts like the back of your hand) then your calculations may be way off. 
Based on my experience (mainly on the action/puzzle genre), I could only say to you that it depends on the features. 
Asking how many levels to include in a game is sort of like asking how many paragraphs to include in your essay, or footsteps to take in your journey. Once you have a clear idea of your destination and your path, the question answers itself.
For example when I had a new set of puzzle logic, I needed 1-2 levels to introduce the feature, then 3-12 levels to build it up and complicate it / fix the difficulty curve, and then maybe in those 3-12 or in some extras I would mix this new feature with previous ones that appeared. 
Historically, there were technical limitations to how much content you can have all together, so the game was split up into levels
The options are almost limitless: you can start adding achievements (if you haven't already) You can add extra levels, challenges, bonus content like skins, rewards add extra rooms to some levels.
A somewhat viable choice is to have a constant of levels you want to make that aims at some % of the budget( and or time) like 70 or 80. Once you have achieved that you have some freedom for the remaining time/money. 
Units of content occur in many places, outside video games too, and there are many ways artists/authors encourage audiences to consume these in units. Books have chapters, and readers often - if they have a choice - stop and start reading between chapters. TV series have episodes, where each episode covers a self-contained story, sometimes within a greater story arc. Some media have only one unit of content, for instance movies are best enjoyed in a single sitting.
This depends on the complexity of your game. A particularly complex strategy game might require long levels.
For story-driven games, the appeal comes from seeing the plot unfold, and if your levels are too short there is simply not enough time to meaningfully move forward with your plot.
Sometimes there is no upper limit to the length of your game; you can keep making it longer so long as the cash is flowing in and the players are there. Just as they keep making episodes of The Simpsons by adding characters or even rehashing plots, you can add levels, new mechanics, rehash old mechanics... and sometimes the players love it!
The only thing I would like to add, is that you NEED to have your game played by impartial, virgin (they haven't played it before) testers.
So it is with games; some have lots of small units of content, e.g. Angry Birds. Some have a single large unit of content, e.g. Civilization, where you are never encouraged to take a break until you've finally conquered the world, some 20-30 hours later. (Some days I think Sid Meier isn't aware that his players need to sleep.)
It's used to control pacing, giving a temporary lull in the action. Sometimes entire levels are devoted to this purpose, e.g. bonus stages
Usually levels are used for many of the above reasons, but you may have noticed a common thread: levels encompass a unit of content, a self-packaged experience meant to be consumed as a whole. That isn't to say you must consume one unit of content at a time, but usually you (are encouraged or compelled to) finish playing after the end of a unit.
But it is a question worth considering because it leads to some interesting observations about game design.
Edit: The X minutes per level is impossible to make, since how fast the player will go through the level depends entirely on his play-style experience. For example an FPS veteran will speed through CoD missions (let's consider that they will be played) where as an RTS player will slowly and methodically go through each part of the level.
It rewards the player, giving them a sense of progress e.g. the castle fireworks in Super Mario Bros
This goes right to the heart of your game design. If I'm standing in a line, I'd play Angry Birds or Candy Crush; if I were at home on a lazy weekend, I have more time and attention available - I could watch a movie.
tl;dr: Finish the game with not the optimal amount of levels for the time/resources add extra content.
