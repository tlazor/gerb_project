I had the same symptom. So maybe this will save someone else some time. My problem was that I was missing the .cfg extension on the files in the include directory.
But in this case, it's claiming the NRPE command isn't even defined, so it's not even getting as far as running it...
This suggests to me that the problem is in the definition on the NRPE server.  Is it possible that your obfuscated variables for myHOST, myUSERNAME, or myPASSWORD contain a character that is interpreted non-literally by NRPE?  (I'm assuming you've already checked for typos and duplicate definitions!)  
Normally, I would suspect a permissions problem with that plugin. Be sure to run your manual tests as the nagios (or nrpe) user.
I had a similar issue sometime ago, it turned out that someone already installed NRPE in the server (i didn't know), and when i tried to access it took the old NRPE version and configuration, the solution was look for the old NRPE and redirect the access...
I recall having a similar problem (but with the NRPE from EPEL), a few years ago, where it wouldn't include another file in nrpe.cfg for some reason. I never did figure out why the include file didn't work, though.
