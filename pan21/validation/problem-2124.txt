Most users will appreciate if you take the time to try to explain the situation to them.  But don't get overly technical.  Keep your words small and try not to use initialisms like DHCP or DNS or TCP/IP.  They don't know what it is, and really couldn't care.  But if you tell them that the computer wasn't working because it couldn't communicate correctly on the network, that should be fine for them.
For many of us in IT, this stuff just inherently makes sense. It always has, and therefore it makes no sense that some folks can be so completely lost at it. If you want to relate, start working on something you know nothing about... rock climbing, flying a Cessna, etc. It really helps.
Learn something new that you don't really know about. I'd say car related is a good start, or motorcycling, which is like learning cars and learning how to avoid being hunted by them. Like IT, there are a lot of little facets to the technology of cars, a lot of evolution, and a great deal of complexity which is packaged up into a shiny box that tries to hide the complexity from its user. When you learn about engine internals, the voodoo that is a carburetor, braking systems, etc. etc. then you'll have something to look back at and remember when you were a noob.
Instead of being as arrogant as your question title indicates, learn to treat them as you would want to be treated and at least half your problem will simply vanish. For the remainder you need to learn to understand them and what they are trying to tell you, rather than worrying about what you're trying to tell them. Once you realise that you will find there are a great many ways to convey technical principles to those who do not share your skills, just as others need to do when talking to you about their area of expertise. Your very question tells me more about your lack of understanding than that of your users.
Just be grateful that computers are light-years easier to use now than 10 or 20 years ago, software is more consistent and there are great tools that let you watch their screen and let you work remotely. 
Respect them for what they do, and they might respect you for what you do. When I installed some software at a medical college one of their techs explained it this way - 'these people can take your body apart and put it back together but they can't rename a file'. 
And keep the geeking-out in front of them to a minimum.  I know you want to celebrate the 1.5 hour troubleshooting session that had you upside down in a crawlspace tracing wires and whatnot, but tell it to your IT co-workers, not the end users.
Don't ignore them.  Answer their questions and try to educate them the best you can.  Most end-users know that they have no clue about technology, except which end the USB drive goes into the computer.  But they definately don't want to feel ignored or looked down on because they don't know as much as you do.
