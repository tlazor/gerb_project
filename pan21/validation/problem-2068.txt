It may be helpful to keep your site-specific or host-specific key-store / trust-store outside the java installation-directory, and instead point to it when you need to consume trust. Presuming your trust-store is at /opt/site/cacerts.JKS, you would do that one of two ways:  
For reference, this is a RHEL 5.10 equivalent (technically Oracle Linux).  I'm using java-1.7.0-openjdk through the official repositories, and just upgraded to U65.
I have imported internal Certificate Authorities into Java's CA keystore.  (Using keytool to import into the "cacerts" store)  This works fine and dandy, until I update the Java RPM.  At which point all of those imported certs are not carried over to the new install.  So applications bomb when attempting to make SSL connections.
Is there any way to make these certificates persist through Java upgrades?  Or an easy way to rerun the import commands on an upgrade trigger?  I can obviously script these commands into my upgrade process, but I'm hoping there's a more elegant solution.
The way I do (maybe not the best?): save cacerts before upgrade and restore after, I scripted it in my update script like this:
