At this point I somehow don't have any of my Windows discs. I'm wondering what kind of Linux Live distro I would need to be able to connect to the Microsoft site and download an .iso as well as burn it. Never used Linux Live. I know there are CD and USB options, but don't know what I need to put on the disc/USB. I figure I just need one with network and DVD drivers.
Also, there is no such product named "Linux Live". You don't just download "Linux"; Linux is a kernel. You download an entire operating system distribution (distro) which contains both the kernel as well as userspace utilities, system programs, and a desktop.
So I'm fairly certain my SSD failed as it seems to have in the past. In two computers the BIOS won't recognize it as a boot option. I RMA'd the same model before and getting a new one worked for a while.
Other questions, such as whether it supports your DVD burner, are practically "non-questions" and are all but guaranteed to be trivially supported.
Pretty much any Desktop Live CD should do. I'd recommend the Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop Live CD. Ubuntu is fairly easy to use, and the newest version (12.10) is known to cause some issues with certain graphics cards.
Almost any recent Linux live CD released in the past couple of years should suffice, although your user experience will be better or worse depending on:
Also note that Microsoft doesn't just give away the ISOs for Windows. You will have to have a valid digital purchase of Windows from the Microsoft Store in order to legally download an ISO version of Windows. If you bought a boxed copy of Windows in a store or ordered (only) the box online, you may not be able to download the ISO. Note that the download might be marked as a ".udf" file, but the process to burn it to a CD/DVD should be exactly the same.
If you already have a computer, likely the one you're sitting at typing out your question, which contains a CD/DVD burner, then I don't understand why you can't skip the intermediate step of booting up Linux, and just directly download the ISO from Microsoft...?
The user experience, i.e. the exact steps to take, in order to burn the ISO will vary, but in general you just fire up the file manager application, fire up Firefox, "do your thing" in Firefox in order to download the ISO, download it, then right-click on the downloaded ISO in the Downloads folder in your home directory and there should be an option to burn it to CD. This should work on most GNOME based distros as well as Unity, so that covers Fedora, Ubuntu, and OpenSUSE/Gnome out of the box.
Edit in response to your clarifications in the comments: I don't think you can put the Windows installation CD on a USB drive. I know there's a way to do it with Windows 8, but not Windows 7 or earlier. You can indeed put Linux on a USB drive from a computer that does not have a CD burner, but you'll need to run a special program such as UNetBootin to write the boot sector correctly and make it bootable.
Step 2: Move the memory stick from the computer without CD burning capabilities, over to the computer with CD burning capabilities.
To do that, you are proposing to connect to a Linux distribution's website, download a Linux distro ISO, and burn it to CD/DVD.
