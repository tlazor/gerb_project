I have a toggle button with 3 pins. I want to use it to turn 2 leds, when it's in one position turn on one led (red) and when it's in the other position turn on the other led (green).
You can connect any LED that has a forward voltage of > 3 volts directly with a GPIO pin of a Raspberry.
I found a lot of information about push buttons, but no about toggle buttons. I tried it using the 5V GPIO like in the schematic below.
Now I want to use 2 GPIOs as inputs to know what led is receiving the current. I'm sure it's possible, i'm sure it's easy but i'm a noob.
Normally 10 mA is reasonably bright for a LED. However, if you want the maximum, check the Raspberry documentation for the recommended maximum current per output pin.
For the other LED, you perform the same steps (probably the red and green LED have different forward voltages). Also it is high likely that 10 mA for a LED red looks more or less bright than 10 mA for a green LED. 
The last condition from your program is strange: you check for both LEDs to be green and write Red led active. I think you probably mean:
It is common not to write == True or == False in boolean expressions, you can leave the == True away, and instead of == False you can write not in front of the expression, thus:
You must not connect a Pi GPIO to a voltage outside the range 0 to 3.3V.  If you do so you will eventually destroy the GPIO and then the Pi.
