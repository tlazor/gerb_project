Also, if I perform a dig axfr @<master ip> domain.com on the slave server, I get a nice zone transfer.
A slave will first check if it has the most current zone before attempting a transfer, otherwise the notify is ignored. The common practice is to use the form YYYYMMDDxx where xx is a minor revision number (if accidentally set too large, there is a process that must be followed to lower the number again)
In later versions of nsd where nsd-control replaces nsdc, the command transfer can be used to attempt, or force_transfer to update regardless of serial change.
However, the zone files don't seem to get updates. After the notify, I perform nsdc patch; nsdc rebuild; nsdc reload; service nsd3 restart on the slave server, just to be sure. But this doesn't change the zone files either.
The forward file is the same on the slave server, except for the line with "newvalue" (the value I want to transfer).
I'm trying to create a master/slave setup using NSD. I have NSD installed on two servers. The servers are running great; when I perform normal DNS queries they return the information from the zone files. However, when I try to nsdc notify on the master, the slave doesn't seem to pick up the new zone configuration.
