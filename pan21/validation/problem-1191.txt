I have a Dell desktop with Windows 7 home premium 64 bit circa Feb 2010.  It could not boot up in repair mode and in safe mode got stuck loading either classpnp.sys or disk.sys, depending on whether it was trying to load from the hard disk, the recovery disk or the reinstall disk. So I couldn't get to a command prompt.  My mouse and keyboard were both wired and running off a USB hub.  Dell support, after two hours of failed attempts to deal with this, and refusing to comment on the classpnp.sys issue that is the topic of so many threads, had to call it a night and said that my $130 one time fee would cover me to continue working on this the next day.  So I read the thread about USB and so switched them to plug directly into the computer rather than via the USB hub.  That fixed the problem entirely.  No need to wipe out my hard drive which was the path Dell support was heading down if they had been able to get the reinstall disk to work, which fortunately they did not.
I would start by making a mirror copy or a full backup of the drive and then take a look at the SMART status of the "failed" drive. 
Such utility may reveal that the drive is indeed failing or that the failure is at a logical level. 
Your best bet for a SMART utility should be to start at the Drive's manufacturer website and check what they offer as far as diagnose utilities.
For a friends PC I was troubleshooting after it did a windows update in windows 7 his PC wouldn't restart, boot off of a windows 7 recovery disk, notta. Based on the post above I had a hunch that his USB hub could be the culprit since someone had mentioned supporting legacy USB devices. That being said as soon as I unplugged the USB 2.0 hub device is working like a champ. Not sure which windows update do this but it was a week ago from the 7th of december. 
Based on that finding I would pursue either fixing the original drive (logical failure) or the mirrored drive (imminent drive failure).
