Next, you need to make sure that the share has the respective POSIX permissions for nobody. For example, if your file permissions allow nobody to read the files in the share but not to modify them, then the writeable option in smb.conf is not going to override that. 
valid users=nobody, for example, does not mean that the user nobody is allowed log in. It means that no other user but nobody can log in. 
Now we get to the share portion of your smb.conf, we can make this a lot simpler. If you wish to map all actions to the guest account, you don't need to use force user and force group. Just use the parameter guest only = yes instead. Together with guest ok = yes this will have the effect that all connections will be mapped to the correct guest account, in our case nobody. 
Furthermore, while you have correctly set map to guest = bad user, you also have to check which user takes the role of guest on your system. Apparently, you have just assumed it's nobody but that's not necessarily the case. If you are not sure, you can specify it manually with guest account = nobody. Needless to say, nobody has to exist on your system! 
Since you are obviously fine to allow guest access, just remove valid users=nobody from the global section.
