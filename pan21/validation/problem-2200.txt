There is no perfect solution (for windows at least) that will take a 2-channel audio source, and map it to your 5.1 configuration.  Windows (by-itself) is only capable of mapping 1 channel to 1 channel.
There are different software applications that will attempt to virtualize the 2-channels of audio into 6-streams appropriate for a front/back/left/right/center/sub setup... like winamp... and also various DVD/blue-ray playback applications.  And there are applications that can read an actual 6-channel source, and playback directly to 6-channels in windows.  Most (if not all) of the latter example require special licensing from THX or Dolby to decode their special codecs that contain all 6 channels.  Some of the software packages out there come in a standard version (without the special codec) and a premium version (with) that will have some additional configuration options that let you assign the channels properly to your sound-system.
Second, How do you know it's not working as designed?  When playing music or whatever that is 2-channels (common stereo which most things you play on your computer are)... it only picks 2 of the 6-channels to play on.  (typically the front left/right)  Yes, you can probably change the channels that are the "primary output"... but the result is the same.
First, How do you want windows to recognize it?   A "5.1" device is merely seen as 6 audio-out channels.
