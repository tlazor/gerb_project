Everything works fine when in device manager I roll back to version 7.12.0.7721 from the non working 7.12.0.7722. I imagine amd screwed this one up and its drivers don't work properly. Or am I missing something?
In playback devices, when sound comes through the default device you can see little green bars illustrating the sound level(how on earth are they called?). Whatever sound I play, media files or system sounds, I see no such bars in my hd device. I do see them though in my realtek digital output if I set them to default. With this I tested and sound comes through headphones(if I check disable front panel detection in realtek manager, as needed). I would imagine sound would come through speakers as well. In the same menu of playback devices, whn I try to click test on my hd device an error pops up stating it is of use by another device.
I have amd radeon HD 6900 graphics card. I updated the drivers via catalyst setup and then I had no sound. My pc is connected to my tv/monitor via hdmi cable. I have tried restarting, sleeping, re-jacking in hdmi cable, reeinstalling driver and nothing works.
