For people who have already finished their undergraduate degree, things are much less structured. If you have a particular professor you would like to work with, you can contact them, and in some cases if you convince them you would be interesting to have around, they can support you with grant money. But there tend not to be full research programs for post-bacs of the sort you are describing.
The two positions were very different.  The first one I got in a pretty straightforward manner through the co-op system at Waterloo.  I did a co-op degree so I did six internships, but this one was the only one that was really research-based.  The second I got by simply emailing a professor out of the blue and asking if I could be a research assistant for the summer.
If you are asking about a pre-doc student position I guess you can do some kind of research internship before the PhD (maybe as a supplementary year of your master program, or with a hiatus in your curriculum).
Most researchers have a PhD because this is the best way to become a researcher, and probably the only (almost surely) way to enter academia. But the ability to conduct (good) research is not correlated to the fact of having a PhD (this is my opinion ;)).
EPFL in Switzerland officially had a pre-doc program in CS, which was basically like a short Masters with fewer courses and more research. I don't think they still offer this program. Unofficially, there are research assistantship/internship opportunities for pre-doctoral students here and there. If the institute you're considering for a PhD offers a Masters program, that can be a good opportunity to do research as well.
In the US, for current undergraduates, there are plenty of summer programs called "REUs" -- Research Experience for Undergraduates. These are research-only positions, usually paid, for 3 months during the summer. Often times faculty mentors will already have well-defined projects that they want their REU students to work on, since undergraduates are usually not yet fully mature researchers. Often these programs will take a dozen or so students in a summer, and have a formal application process.
I did two four-month stints as a research assistant before starting my MSc.  The first was in industry between my third and fourth years as an undergrad.  The second was between my undergrad and MSc at a university with a professor who later became my PhD supervisor.
Of course, something that is very much like you are describing is the PhD program itself! At many schools (e.g. CMU) you can begin on research immediately in your first year, and although PhD programs do have some course requirements, at schools like CMU you are not required to take any of your courses in your first year. So you can always take the first year to explore research, and drop out of the program if you do not. 
I would say if you're interested in trying out an institution, the best thing to do would be to contact some potential supervisors directly.  It might improve your chances if you find out what funding might be available; you can mention these possible funding sources in your email.
But if you ask for a research position without PhD, yes it exists in many countries. I guess this is call research engineer or research officer. You can start a PhD afterwards, or even in the context of this position (it can be an easiest way of finding funding).
I'm Canadian, and both positions ended up being funded by the NSERC USRA program.  I would assume similar programs exist in other countries.
