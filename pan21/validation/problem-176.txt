I was testing the network with Windows clients in the beginning, and both PCs had got the Windows 10 upgrade lately. The problem itself was really stupid: Windows didn't response to pings since there is some new security enabled by default in Windows 10. When I added one Linux laptop to the network I got to a situation where all others could ping the Linux laptop (default policy was ALLOW) but the Linux PC couldn't ping anything else (Windows didn't response to ping). Then I tried remote desktop to the Windows PCs in VLANs 10 and 50, from the Linux PC in VLAN 100 and boom - it worked!
And following up on the routing table comment, your routing table is correct, indicating that your firewall is directly connected to your VLANed networks.
Since the FORWARD default policy is ACCEPT (you can keep it until you found out the root cause of your problem), every single ping should have succeeded. Let's look at the ones who doesn't :
Double check your Cisco conf (and open another question if you are almost sure the whitch is the root cause), verify every single vlan have internet access.
By the way, if you only have 4 vlans, try the 12 pings you can do to provide enough informations to debug.
Did you add the log line after your existing rules ? If you did, there is what I think about your issue.
Can you try the 8 ping from (and to) router interfaces? (eg. on the router: ping -I eth1.100 10.10.100.100)
As far as the other pings, notice that in your log entries, the TTL is either 127 or 63, indicating the firewall has already made its routing decision and decremented the TTL. Also, your firewall is not configured to block any traffic. This suggests the problem is in the routing configuration of the clients. May I suggest you use a sniffer on the ping recipient to see if the original ping packet is arriving? Make sure the default gateway for clients (not the firewall) on 10.10.10.0/24 is 10.10.10.1, etc. Good luck!
First, your default policy in the FORWARD chain is ACCEPT, so you're not actually denying any traffic. This explains why the 20 -> 50 forwarding works. You can fix this with iptables -P FORWARD DROP.
What we want is <receiver mac><eth1 mac><not interesting>, so we could see if the packet is send to the right place.
