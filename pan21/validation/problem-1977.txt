I found the package manager can place in a variety of locations, so using which (you will need to explicitly install this if using a container) the following is a little less brittle
it's /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64/. I found out what it was by doing update-alternatives --display java and it showed me the directory /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java
Thats weird, the whole point of having a JAVE_HOME environmental variable is so you don't have to specify the path to each program, it can get this path by looking for this variable. 
I have install java through yum on CentOS, however another java programme needs to know what the JAVA_HOME environmental variable is. I know all about setting environmental variables, but what do I set it to? java is installed in /usr/bin/java, it can't be there!
To set this for the system you want to edit your /etc/profile or add a .sh file in /etc/profile.d folder.  For a particular user you can put it in the users ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile files.
If the JDK (Development kit) is installed, ypu probably want it to point to that, else use the JRE path (Java Runtime Environment).  Then, you might want to set your $PATH environment variable to include the bin directory as well:
Running this command will display the path no matter what version you are running, from command line.
