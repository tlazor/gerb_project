The start menu was first changed in Windows Vista. According to Microsoft, it is still referred to as the Start Button. While many users refer to it as the Windows Orb, the phrase rarely appears in official Microsoft documents.
By default, with Aero enabled, the button is not labeled; however, hovering over the button provides a tooltip which says Start:
Furthermore, depending on the theme installed in Windows 7, if Aero is enabled, it will be a colorful Orb. If the Basic theme is installed, it will still be an Orb. If classic is installed, it will say "Start".
With most users, it could just be referred to as the Start Button, as they will likely be familiar with the concept. If not, you could use one of the following:
Is there another way to tell a user to open the "Start" Menu, so that I can avoid going through this?
