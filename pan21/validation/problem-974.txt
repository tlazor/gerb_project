Then, I was going to have a separate server off site, but ideally I'd like that to be a clone of the production server (security, databases, the whole shot).  I have a few questions about this:
I think I was able to convince my cow-erkers that jamming all the databases on one server is a good idea.  So, our setup will be something like this:
Yes, if you have software assurance you can still have a warm standby.  (It used to be that you could have one without software assurance as long as you weren't querying it, but that changed with 2014.)
Standby - SQL 2014 (with automatic failover from Production) (I think I can get this license free if I get SA on the Prod server, right?)
It sounds like what you're looking at is AlwaysOn Availabilty Groups, but do check the licensing (as Steve Mangiameli said in comments).  (Particularly:  If you are querying a "warm standby," you have to license it.)  It looks like AlwaysOn will do almost everything you want (both synchronous and asynchronous replicas) with one exception:  Asynchronous mode only supports manual failovers.  (Other things that provide automatic failover include clustering and mirroring with a witness server, but it sounds like you want AlwaysOn because of the multiple replicas.)
