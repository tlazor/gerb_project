One thing to keep in mind with trunk redundancy is that STP fails over slowly, even with Rapid STP.  If you set up the two links as an aggregated channel, the link failover is much faster.  STP failover is the slowest, routing protocol failover is an order of magnitude faster, and the aggregation channel failover is another order of magnitude faster still.
RTG - Must explicitly disable RSTP. RTG and RSTP are mutually exclusive. Once RSTP is disabled configure both links the same but also provide the RTG group configuration under ethernet-switching options - (http://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos13.2/topics/example/cfm-ex-series-redundant-trunk-groups.html)
RSTP - configure both links the same. Ensure that RSTP is enabled on both sides of the link via 'set protocols rstp interface xe-blah' or just ensure 'set protocol rstp interface all' is configured.
Link aggregation would be preferred as RSTP and RTG are an active/standby configuration by default. Whereas with link aggregation you could make use of both paths and have automatic failover with no STP like delay should a link fail.
Link aggregation - Create aggregated ethernet interface, the trunk configuration goes under the aggregated ethernet interface while the physical members will just be configured to be members of the AgEth bundle.
