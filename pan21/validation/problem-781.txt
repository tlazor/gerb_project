Now, our developers want to setup a server using static IP of R2s so that it can be accessed remotely. For this purpose, we changed the internal IP of R2s to 192.168.0.101 so it appears as just any other device to R1 and connected it to the switch S1. The machine which will be made server has been assigned IP: 192.168.0.51 and is connected to the switch S1.
From the title of this post it might seem a very thing to do but still let me explain the whole setup here.
So the primary router is R1 has DHCP enabled. Its output goes to a D-Link 8 port unmanaged switch which has another 8 port switch attached to it. Let's call them S1 and S2. An output S2 from goes to the LAN port of WiFi router (W1). This lets me keep all devices on the same network including those on the WiFi. W1 merely acts as a wireless switch. This network has IP range of 192.168.0.xxx.
Now, when I hit the static IP of R2s, it should forward that request to 192.168.0.51 and launch the application on the server on the specified port. So, I set it in the NAT. From R2s' admin page, .51 can be pinged but when we try to access it from outside, it doesn't work.
We've two ISP connections with two different routers. One of them has a static IP. Let's call them R1 and R2s (s-static ip). R2s is our backup router, in case R1 is down.
