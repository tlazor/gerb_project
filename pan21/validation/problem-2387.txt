LibreOffice developer blog post about signing existing PDF files in LO 5.3 or newer: http://vmiklos.hu/blog/pdf-sign.html
Anyone having access to your PNG or any document where it is used, such as the PDF you are intending to embed this on, will have a perfect, infinitely reproducible copy of your autograph signature. It offers no security at all and in fact is detrimental to it: upon seeing your scribble on a document, recipients may be tempted to assume that it is authentic and not bother to check for an actual (and legally valid) electronic signature. Acrobat is, or at least used to be, a major offender in this regardâ€”I have seen documents trivially "forged" because of this ill-conceived feature.
As an alternative, a PDF (or any other file) may be signed using a detached signature with GPG or any of its numerous frontends (such as Kleopatra or Kgpg in KDE).
To my knowledge, currently none of Okular's backends support electronic signatures, although that feature has been requested a number of times.
I know that solution is not cryptographically correct, but it works for me! But if someone can outline a FOSS solution that can cryptographically sign a PDF document, I will gladly accept that answer!
The only way that a PDF can be signed using FOSS software is to wrap the PDF inside of an open digital signature file format.
You could also investigate remote signing services, where your PDF will be presented to you as HTML which you can then sign. You can sign weakly with an adopted picture of something that resembles your hand written signature - which is a very bad idea as noted by other answers and comments. You can sign more strongly with a cryptographic key - usually with the proviso that the remote signing service hold your key. I do not know if any remote signing services allow you to hold the key, for example, on a 2-factor token device or encrypted on your own hard disk.
So, it's been about 1.5 years since I asked this question, and I still haven't found an optimal solution for this issue. The main shortcoming is finding a FOSS program to cryptographically sign and verify a PDF document.
So, I just wanted to share my current solution, which inserts a png of my image using GIMP. Basically, I am following the steps outlined in the article from my question. But I also use a GIMP plug-in to handle multi-page PDF, outline here: http://www.zyxware.com/articles/4438/how-to-export-multiple-layers-from-gimp-into-a-pdf-file And here is the plug-in: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jzdkgv2f0jrbw6i/export-layers-to-pdf.py?dl=0
There are no FOSS PDF readers that can sign an Adobe PDF. The reason for this is that signable PDFs created with Adobe tools use Adobe proprietary extensions of the PDF format. PDF is an open format but in this case Adobe have created their own extensions which are owned, patented and licensed by them in order to prevent others from being able to do this.
