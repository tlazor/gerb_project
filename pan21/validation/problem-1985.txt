Now, you can easily play Blu-Ray disc with VLC on Windows 8 64-bit or Windows 8 32 bit for free. Note: VLC 2.0 still doesnâ€™t have menu support yet.
VLC should be able to play Blu-Ray's.  However, they don't provide menu support as of yet.  The link has the following procedure on it:
MakeMKV also supports streaming of videos from the disk, so that you don't have to rip them to your computer first. There are some tutorials on integrating this functionality to enable Blu-ray playback in XBMC (without needing to use MakeMKV separately). 
The program is currently free while it is in beta. It has been in beta for quite a while now and doesn't show much sign of changing. If your version happens to 'expire' they regularly post new registration keys in their forums.
I personally use MakeMKV. It is able to rip the majority of Blu-ray and HD-DVD movies (and I believe DVD too). This removes all the copy protection from the video, which allows them to be played in pretty much any (decent) media player (VLC, XBMC, MPC-HC).
