Unless you're planning on being tied in by Citrix, you should steer clear. At least with the open source xen you're likely to able to migrate to KVM when the time comes with a lot less hassle.
I'd think again about Xen. Aside from Citrix (who clearly have a vested interest) Xen is on a slide into obscurity and back to the computer science community. I use Xen (with a linux Dom0) a lot and have done for a long time, it solved a problem and offered an alternative to VMware. RedHat (and others) are dropping Xen, although they will support it until it's EOL. KVM is the winner in all this thanks to it being in the kernel and RedHat buying the company and having big plans for it. 
The Xen management domain has also been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel and distro support for Xen is improving Ubuntu 11.10 and Fedora 15 ( http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2011/09/14/fedora-16-virtualization-test-day/ ) are adding distro support for Xen.

As a middle ground to both of these options (on that let's you get the enterprise features of XCP/XenServer and let's you have a custom Linux platform) is Project Kronos ( http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2011/07/22/project-kronos/)
In a few years time KVM, VMware and Hyper-V are likely to be the only real players left on the server. So starting out with Xen now is likely to cost you a lot of time in future.
The introduction of pvops to the linux kernel solves some issues that led to distros like Ubuntu dropping support for Xen dom0.
Virtual host providers like Amazon are still using Xen and I think we'll see a revival in its popularity.
The options for deploying Xen have increased and are continuing to improve. First, one important consideration is the Xen Cloud Platform (XCP), which is an open source version of Citrix XenServer. XCP is "enterprise-ready server virtualization and cloud computing platform, delivering the Xen Hypervisor with support for a range of guest operating systems including Windows® and Linux® network and storage support, management tools in a single, tested installable image, which is also called XCP appliance."
