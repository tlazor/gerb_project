Until that NAT session expires, or you manually expire it from (Monitoring/Sessions) you will continue to access the resource even though the firewall rule no longer exists for it
So the only thing that seems to make sense is if TMG is caching the authentication request coming from the machine I'm working on.
From there, I kept the correct information in the receive port but put an invalid name/password into the send adapter but the process completed successfully (should have failed with 407).
Validate credentials every (seconds) â€” This option enables the caching of client credentials for a configurable period of time. 
that shouldn't be your problem but the steps to configure revese caching rules can be found here:  Configure Forefront TMG as a Proxy Cache
I'm testing a client machine that makes requests to a biztalk server using a forefront machine as a web proxy. Upon first test I put in an invalid name/password into the receive port and received the correct error message (407). Then, I set the correct name/password and everything worked correctly.
