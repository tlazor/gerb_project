I landed up having to put an entry in the hosts file so Windows 7 could resolve the IP to a name, after that Office Trust Centre allowed it
Despite the misguiding name, Home Network is used for networks you trust. The names may be somewhat confusing an unintuitive to the task at hand. But here's an explanation:
In addition to core network configuration under Windows 7, Windows Firewall also works in conjunction with the chosen network by enabling or disabling access features. For instance, under a Public Network, Windows Firewall doesn't enable Network Discovery.
Networks in Windows 7 are divided in two major groups; Private and Public groups. Private groups are split into two types of networks; Home and Work networks. Private groups are thus networks with a good deal of trust between computers. The Public group only offers the Public Network.
This nomenclature is not chosen from the user perspective, but from the security point of view. That is, a Public Network is a network that needs a lot more protection. You use this type of network when connecting to Airports networks, or the many wireless access points out there. A Private Network (Work and Home) is a network where trust among computers is higher. Incidentally, the difference between these two is that computers under a Home Network configuration can only access other members of this network. Whereas on a Work Network, it is possible to do more including taking server roles.
I've had this before when setting a mapped drive on a different subnet on a different domain. I went through all the trusted zone stuff.
