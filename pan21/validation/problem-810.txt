The problem is that with a computer 10 years old it could be anything causing the problem.  The processor could be overheating, the motherboard might think the processor is overheating (if it has thermal detection) due to old and faulty components on the motherboard, it could be the PSU getting old and tired.... It sounds like to me that you maybe ought to just go and invest a little more into a new computer.
With that in mind if your fans are working like you said and the air flow and the air intakes and outlets are clear of any dust etc. it could be the PSU going faulty but from what you are describing with shorter power-up times each time it does sound like an overheating issue.
On the other hand you could go and get a very good PSU on the understanding that it could be used in a new computer that you put together yourself if that doesn't help in your current 10 year old computer.
I am wondering about your processor chip.  You said you took the chip out and cleaned it.  Have you done this before? Did you put fresh thermal compound on the chip before putting the heatsink back on?  If you didn't that can cause problems as the heat from the processor may not transfer to the heatsink effectively.
