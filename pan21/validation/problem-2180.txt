3) Reset to the last good configuration(system restore point - unfortunately it seems that this update removed all of them).
Twice i have power off this computer but the same phenomena is going on. Once i went to the recovery mode and got the hard drive checked - no errors were found...in that session i tried to return back to the operating system and exit.
1) Recover using the recover partition - no success(very interesting - what is recovery partition then)
I have microsoft family safety enabled and this computer is mainly used by my son. He had 4 hours yesterday and prior to that my wife was using this computer. 
I have a 3.5 years old HP Pavillion desktop(Intel Quad Core Processor, 32 GB RAM, 2 GB Nvidia Graphics card and regular hard drives - 7200 RPM).
Windows 10 update started happening almost at 2:45 pm central and it's going on and on. System keeps on rebooting and that's it.
Finally i have to try install from fresh using Windows 10 media. This time i installed on the separate hard drive so that i can recover the data from the previous hard drive(which contains windows and some other programs),
