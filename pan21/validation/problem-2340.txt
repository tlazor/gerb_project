As you tackle this problem, be patient. Thoroughly read documentation and begin writing to the disk only once you've understood something. You don't want to read something like "type d," then type d in response, only to continue reading "only if you want to lose all your data." ;-)
In some cases, tools like TestDisk can locate filesystems even if the partition table has been completely lost, enabling recovery of the partition table. This is most likely to work if your disk had multiple partitions and your accident did not intrude into the start point(s) of some of your partitions. For instance, if you overwrote the first partition but left the second intact, TestDisk might help you recover the second partition, even if your disk used MBR and you lost your original MBR data.
I usually include advice to make a low-level backup with dd in a case like this, but I'll keep that short this time, since you say you've already done it. (I want to get in some mention of this for the benefit of other readers, though.)
