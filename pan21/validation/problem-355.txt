Note that grep can give you a window before and after matching lines. A little clever scripting gives you a pretty robust search capacity and you can manage it all on your own disk space...
Personally, I've been searching for good solutiom for personal info/knowledge-management for years. Tree-based concepts did not work for me, because I have too many links between info. Example: I started off with Client\Projects-Structure, but then I met the same external consultant for the first time in a 2nd project with another customer. The way I had my stuff setup, I could not properly add a "Consultant"-Dimention to my info, would have needed fulltext search and similar solutions.
Disclaimer: since I was (and still am) so enthustiastic about this software, I became german reseller last year (http://www.pbrain.de). But this doesn't make my advice less genuine or true ;)
There is a free 30 days trial-download, the software works on Mac, Linux and Windows, Registration is $149 or $249.
You can try using Xobni as an Outlook extender. It has better search, and better organization capabilites as well. 
What I used to do is to host a Wordpress installation in my localhost and just post snippets of information here. :P
If you have less than 1GB, I would recommend the perhaps off-beat use of Posterous. just forward all the emails you want to save to post@posterous.com and you'll be greeted with an editable, searchable blog. Woot! you can of course make it private.
As someone who has been using email since the 1970s, I've tried just about all the usual routes. However, I've settled quasi-permanently into this scenario:
Finally, no way in the world I would use Outlook - it's just troublesome malware if you ask me. I want access to my raw data, thank you!
Aside first: I'd recommend XOBNI as a tool for Outlook-searches. Thee free version, however, is limited to searching for contacts, IIRC.
My search ended when I discovered "PersonalBrain" 3 yrs ago. As you are familar with MindMapping: PersonalBrain gives you the possibility to organize information in a graphical way, not too far awayr from MindMaps, but with some key differences that give you so much more possibilities. My current "Brain" has 18.000+ "thoughts" in it, from family over church to ALL relevant biz-info, software-development notes and whatever.
