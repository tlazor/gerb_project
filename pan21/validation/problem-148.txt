OK. After a lot of experimentation I have managed to solve the case! In simplest terms here is how to run multiple instances of SkyDrive simultaneously on Windows:
If no SkyDrive process is already running on the computer, this will work and start the SkyDrive process of that account. However this will mean that I cannot start the SkyDrive process of my primary account. Starting that will simply open the SkyDrive folder of the other account. And Vice versa.
I created a new user, switched accounts to set up and run SkyDrive. This works fine except that I need to always remember to log in the other account(s) when I start my computer, another downside is that each log in starts unnecessary programs that just take up RAM.
Note: You can, of course place the above code multiple times as needed for each account into one batch file. I plan to post a more detailed version of the above instructions on my blog soon.
