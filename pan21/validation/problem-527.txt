You can enable split tunneling using Powershell too. For example, in Windows 10 the "Use default gateway in remote" option is not accesible.
When vpn is connected, change the gateway for the remote net to the IP address assigned to your cisco vpn client - in your ipconfig it's 10.0.53.22 - and metric to 10 (because < 276) to make sure that this route is valid.
I'm connecting to a VPN which doesn't allow split tunneling and basically reroutes my Internet traffic through, which is slow. Additionally and more importantly, this also effectively removes my machine from local LAN.
I'm looking for a way to modify routing table on Windows 7 to route Internet traffic and local LAN connections as usual, and restrict VPN traffic to 10.0.53.0 network, but although I know how to route delete and route add, I'm failing to understand what exactly I need to reroute.
you problem is related to the version of the vpn client you use. If it es a cisco client, cisco has already fixed it with version 5.0.07.0410-k9 for 32Bit and 5.0.07.0440-k9 for 64Bit.
