Failure can occur at any moment- and without knowing the manufacturer of the power supplies and/or hard disks, it's impossible to know for sure. Even knowing the figures- they are only ever averages- failure can occur at any moment. You need to evaulate the options and decide if they are worth the cost(s).
In general, however, if you can afford to have unexpected downtime of server from 30min (if data center stacks the supplies) to up to 3-5 business days(or whatever it takes to get a new one ordered and delivered), then no need for extra power supply. If you'd rather not, consider, if the price is right for having secured yourself against that.  In general, extra power supplies shouldn't be very expensive.
I generally see hard drives fail a LOT more than power supplies. In any given year I'll likely replace 20 or 30 hard drives and maybe only 3 or 4 power supplies. One thing to note about redundant power supplies, if they're just redundant its nice, if they're load balancing + redundant its amazing. Other than a pair of direct lightening hits, at different clients, I've never had to worry about redundant/load balanced power supplies going bad. Theres something about the load balancing that gets done that really helps keep power supplies healthy. I've often replaced entire servers before replacing power supplies when they're load balanced.
Yes, power supplies in decent data centers tend to last a long time, possibly exceeding server life. It still is a risk though. Additionally, there is a question of how long will the replacement take -- does the datacenter stack the spares, or will it have to be ordered or something.
There are availability estimates for those kinds of things. I would think the datacenter should just provide you an estimate of % of uptime you get for the price, rather than try to involve you in a technical discussion of how to achieve it.
