Full disk encryption creates a small boot partition which is unencrypted with just enough stuff to start the OS and get a passphrase, then using this to mount the main partition and rest of the IS. It's is the more secure way to go because, excluding a well defined limited area, all data is encrypted. It's fine using luks - which is standard smong Linux distros, meaning you can recover data even if the computer fails and you need to use another one.
The alternate option is file level encryption. This generally only encrypts files in users home directories. It's conceptually more complex to implement and not as secure (the encryption is good, but unexpected data may not be encrypted, and hints can be leaked in file  size -I and it has got a larger attack surface) - but as it's only encrypting some files it's less CPU intensive.
On your system, using encryption will have a noticeable performance impact because the I3-2120 CPU does not have aes-ni support to speed up AES encryption/decryption.
