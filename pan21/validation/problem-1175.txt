You can read the data provided by those daemons with tools such as snmpwalk. Most likely, that's not what you want though.
I'd like to know if there's a GUI app, preferably for OSX but other platforms work too, which could handle the data collection and render them into graphs so that I wouldn't need to open a lot of terminals? Optimally the app could be so light that I could use it in day-to-day monitoring, but this is handled by Munin already on a wider scale, so it's not a necessity.
I'm administering a set of Linux servers with varying purposes, and occasionally when I run maintenance tasks I'd like to see how each of the servers handles them. For this I need to open several terminals with tload running in each, and a couple more for free -m looping in a couple of boxes.
Other tools can also periodically fetch that data from the target machine and plot nice graphs from it. One of these tools is Cacti.
If Cacti is not for you, I completely understand :) Alternatives can be easily dug up search the web for SNMP and RRDTool (the tool that draws the graphs shown in the picture above).
Note: I'm not sure if this belongs here or on Server Fault, but since I'm looking for a client-side app, I thought I'd try here first.
If an appropriate daemon is running on the target machine, you can connect to it and retrieve the data you're interested in. Appropriate daemon packages are:
