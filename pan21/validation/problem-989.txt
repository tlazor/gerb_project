Check your BIOS settings for boot sector virus protection features, then shut those features off before you update your volume header.
These virus protection features included in the BIOS are a good idea, but can interfere with software that operates on boot sectors and partition tables (as some boot-based viruses from the DOS days did so) because the changes are prevented from actually being written to disk.
Since I reinstalled Windows and the problems are gone now, I can only assume that a preinstalled application like "Dell DataSafe Local Backup" caused the problems.
Btw, the application crashed sometimes without being used by me at all - and the uninstaller failed as well. If anyone else experiences this problem I recommend to install a clean Windows and manually install the required drivers.
I suspect that you might have such a feature enabled in your BIOS, and that it's preventing your desired changes from taking effect.
The mentioned application is able to recover the system "without erasing personal files and data" an as such has to access the recovery partiton from time to time - maybe there is a bug that writes into the header of another partition as well.
