I live in an apartment with one roomate. They have a monopoly, as the complex actually has it's own special ISP they offer...and they restrict other, better providers like Verizon, Charter, and so on. We have a relatively, but strictly enforced, bandwidth cap of 200 gb per month. After 200 gb, we receive a letter, and our speeds are dramatically reduced.
For the past 3 - 4 months, we've reached the cap every month, and due to work and school, I'm only there a few hours a day. I talked about it with my roomate, and he's been downloading torrent files as big as 70 gb, and streaming lengthy podcasts that are FLAC file type.
I've asked him to stop, as these things are causing us to reach our cap fairly quickly...and it's frustrating. He hasn't stopped. Is there anyway I can restrict his access on the home network? The modem is connected to a wireless router that I bought two years ago, I know the password and can log in any time to change the settings. The router page has a mac address filtering tab, but it doesn't work very well and I can't quite figure out how to kick him off the network. How would I go about this?
