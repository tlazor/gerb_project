It maybe more productive to arrange training for your users, either 1-1 or 1-10 or so, where you could teach them things like this. I doubt any end user would otherwise find the time to read these kind of guides. You have to make the user have some benefit from learning this information- as otherwise, they will be questioning the point of it.
A better use of your company's time and money would be to make these guides anyway, and hire entry-level IT staff to walk the users through these steps when they get called. They're often known as "call scripts" in some industries, because the technician doesn't need to be well-trained (if he was, his time would be better spent doing more advanced things) - he just reads the flowchart/outline/choose-your-own-adventure to narrow the problem down, and either resolve or escalate.
The most we expect users to do is either restart the computer or check that cables are "plugged in tight" before calling. That's usually the extent they'll go before getting frustrated.
In my experience, most users will not read directions like this, no matter how simple. If they see it as your job to make the technology beepy blinky things work, they're going to call you. They don't care what you'd like them to do because it's your job to "make it go."
To echo what people are saying here, this isn't likely to work, and isn't even really a good use of the users' time. Remember - they're working for your company to make money for the company. If they can't work, why should IT be wasting their time making them jump through hoops?
I'll echo what the others have said. I've tried to make tutorials and little video clips on how to do something or make something work but ultimately you are wasting your time. There might be the odd few members of staff who appriciate the work but there's the potential to have to create so many tutorials it's not just worth it. In the end it's just a whole lot easier for them to pick up the phone and give me a call.
