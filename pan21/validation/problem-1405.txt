"since the controller only has 24 ports, do I use 2 controllers or can the AP units connect into a switch then into the controller?"
base on this, I bet that it will mostly impossible to properly support roaming (as intended by H3C) if remote APs are connected to common ethernet-switches AND you don't have enough licenses. In other words, to support roaming (again: in the H3C way), your APs needs to be fully managed by the AC and... this means, at least, you need to have proper licensing in place.
A final note, based on your last statement: "I am new to building large networks": please consider spending less on the hardware and investing what you save on "professional services"
The relationship between a so-called "wireless controller" and related "access-points" heavily depends on the technical implementation built by the vendor in its own products. As such, unfortunately, the word "wireless controller" is way-too-general, and can easily represents very different architectures. As an example, a Cisco "Wireless LAN Controller" is very very different from yours.
(BTW: I stressed the concept "roaming in the H3C way" as it's really normal, for a wireless client, to associate to a different wireless-lan as soon as the wireless signal becomes lower than a predefined threshold, defined/managed by the wireless driver. So, wireless roaming, can also be intended... as a "free" feature provided by the wireless client. Unfortunately a deep discussion of this "feature" is a matter for a completely different question)
