In some ISPs, they are monitoring and auditing your packets and using sometimes something called content filtering which can filter, or block some prohibited websites in your country/isp. By using vpn connection you are bypassing this filter, or even site blocker by your unmonitored anynumous data which can make your connection faster again.
My question is how is this possible?  Is it somehow faking out the tests, or is it possible that this VPN is somehow increasing my speed by 5X?
Well, I have a very different answer to your question and by the way what you have got for the speed test is correct and true!
However, lately I've been using a VPN (PrivateInternetAccess.com) on my desktop.  I was curious how my speed was over the VPN, so I ran a speed test, and my speed came in at 175 Mbps, which seems insane.
I verified it with three speed tests, turned the VPN off and tried again, then turned it back on and tried again.  Here are my results:
My Internet connection is for 30 Mbps with TWC (Cable), which is usually pretty close to what I actually get.
