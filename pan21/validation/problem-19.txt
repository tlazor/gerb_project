You can set an individual chat window to "stay on top" which doesn't exactly do what you request.. and doesn't last once the window is closed.
How do I make it pop up, so I notice that someone is trying to contact me?  It does flash once, but if I'm already in another conversation, it's very easy to overlook that a new window has opened.  And if I overlook that flash, then there's very little to make me notice it after that.
Then the trick is to use Win7 accessibility 'use text or alternatives for sounds'. There are several options, I chose 'flash active window'.
I'm trying to keep the user window on top, which should let me see which users have pending notifications next to their names.
Office Communicator can be configured to always make a sound for an incoming message regardless of one's status. Problem is most of us have sound turned off.

I recently converted to Windows 7 and I usually have Office Communicator running.  When someone else instigates a conversation with me, the notification pops up, but behind everything else, and as just another item in the taskbar.
