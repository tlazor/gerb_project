This started with a browser hijacker called Snapdo. Somehow this thing got installed, and i removed this thing entirely from the machine using IObit Uninstaller, Ran malwarebites scans, ran AVG scans. Removed temp folders and removed almost every trace i could find. And reseted browsers to their original conditions, reinstalled them too. Nothing happens...
I have this weird problem in my laptops internet connection. I use this laptop for my day to day work + company work. With my company internet connection there are no issues, internet works fine (goes through a proxy).
However, i noticed that only HTTP sites are not being loaded by the browsers. HTTPS sites work fine such as Google(Every google service works properly). I did everything in the answers which google search provided me with this case. But i didn't find an exact case like this. 
But when i use my laptop with any other connection pages stops loading. Gives me err_connection_refused error. But there's nothing wrong with the internet connection. It works fine, i tried pinging too, and it works. And i tried loading pages with IE and Firefox, same thing. Did not load pages. 
PS : sometimes it works for a minute or two and just stops working again. There are no malicious processors or services i could find either. Removed everything that looked malicious and untrusted. Can anyone help me on this?
