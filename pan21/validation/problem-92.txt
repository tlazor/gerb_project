In theory it is possible but why would you want to? If you are only going to have a few people looking at it, then you loose the benefits of distributed bandwidth.
If you're willing to pay, you could host your data on Amazon's S3. It includes automatic BitTorrent support
BitTorrent will really get messy here, as people cannot just upload stuff - they need to create torrent files for every file and then add the file to the server. The BT Client on the server then needs to be made aware of this and add the .torrent file to it's queue, and only then the user can "upload" his actual file.
You'd be better off using one of the many free web apps out there that include a file upload module. Using bittorrent to share files amoung a few people sounds like a fantastic way to have all the difficulty of use that bittorrents bring with none of the benefits of massively distributed hosts and reduced bandwidth at any one point to make up for it.
I would rather recommend plain old FTP. You get your directory listing for free as it's part of the protocol and people don't need an extra client, as all good browsers have a basic FTP Client built in. Only for uploading they need a FTP Program.
