is it possible for one interface to do both L2 switching and L3 switching? - There's no such thing as Layer 3 switching. When a Layer 3 switch is switching packets then it's acting as a switch. When it's routing packets then it's acting as a router. Layer 2 and Layer 3 are two different layers. Switching occurs at Layer 2. Routing occurs at Layer 3.
If you already have a router then you don't need to use the routing (Layer 3) capability of the switch at all.
I have a switch supporting both L2 and L3 Switching. It is connected to one router (so L3) and one device using L2 switching.
So the question is, in case all the routers uses the same vlan, is it possible for one interface to do both L2 switching and L3 switching? What I mean is, does the standard allow this (I will not complicate this by including switch/router model, just trying to keep it on a theoretical level)? Both the router and the switch is needed, since the router is integrated in other hardware.
In case this work I would then let the next hop address to the router be the gateway address to the interface on the switch. Would this be possible?
