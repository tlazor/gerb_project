I want to configure TLS. I need to understand where "opportunistic" vs "mutual" applies, as in do I use it for both internet and internal, or only internet.
Controlling relay security is an entirely different question...  Get the above working as you want first, then follow up on that.  If you want to understand what this stuff means, you're going to need to read a book on Exchange, rather than just a simple tutorial.  You're going to have to read some RFCs as well.
I am having a very hard time getting clear about receive connectors in Exchange 2010, which I have unhappily inherited.
Permission Groups are related to authentication by specifying WHO is allowed to log in using the specified authentication mechanism.
2) Don't mess with the identity.  That's an active directory attribute and is pretty much internal to Exchange.  Leave it alone, it doesn't affect operation of the server.  The name is based on the name the server knows itself as and a GUID.
5) Okay, AuthMechanism is a list of acceptable ways to authenticate.  Can you only log in using Windows?  Not so great in an Environment with Macs or Linux included.  Can you log in using Basic Authentication?  ( Plain text ) Preferably not by itself, even internally.  Only as a last resort.  
Links to articles which don't present specific instructions on how to accomplish what I listed above are not helpful.
3) Leave the DistinguishedName alone.  The DN is an LDAP attribute and identifies an object uniquely in the directory ( Active Directory in this case ). 
Explanations of how these connectors are used for my specific needs are very helpful, and I appreciate the help.
Which should give you 3 receive connectors.  Outlook clients should be limited to port(s) 585 and 587.  You can use the (All Available IPv4) option to filter them, assuming you do not expose your client submission port to the public internet.  You can also limit it to the internal IP address of your Exchange server if you wish.
Well, it depends on how you're going to separate them out.  If you need a specific connector for an application, you need to be able to identify it by IP address, authentication type, and encryption requirement.
I have a third party who needs to send email using my DNS name and IP, which I think is called "relay". I need to know if that is correct, and how to configure it.
What you'll most likely want to do is start with several connectors.  Classify your clients like the following, for example:
AuthMechanism configures the methods available for authentication.  Exchange Server authentication is between two Exchange Servers.  Basic Authentication is more or less standard, but for an External source, you'll want to ONLY Offer Basic Authentication after starting TLS.  Otherwise, you're sending your usernames and passwords over the internet using plaintext if you have clients using SMTP to send email from outside your network.
The reason for asking these questions together is that some of them impact others, and if asked separately they would probably not make clear what I need to accomplish.
The "Identity" attribute is related to the GUID. Again, it currently shows as \<"Name" attribute>. The question is whether I can change that to the public DNS name for my mail server, "mail.domain.com".
10) Yes, that's called relaying.  I recommend doing the same thing for the third party as for the apps.  Create a receive connector for their server, then give them a username and password to send mail from.  That's assuming that they're sending email from your domain.  If you're truly relaying mail for other domains, make sure that you're requiring a username and password before doing so.
8) You can use connectors for your applications that are specific to the server that is sending mail ( where the application lives ) by filtering using the network tab.  Then you can configure authentication and permission groups based on the capabilities of the application.  You can filter for a single group, set opportunistic TLS, and enable anonymous users and your server will accept all mail without a username and password from that server.  I recommend configuring an active directory user that is denied logon locally permissions and creating a mailbox that rejects all mail to allow using the Exchange Users Permission Group so that you're authenticating the application using a username and password if possible.  Always use TLS.  If it's opportunistic, it should request rather than require anyway.
I want to understand which values should be set for the "AuthMechanism" attribute, and why, given that I want to configure TLS.
I have internal applications which I think need separate connectors, from what I have read. I need to know if that is true, and how to configure that.
I would suggest making two mostly-identical external connectors and setting Require TLS on one and leaving it turned off for the other.  The enable protocol logging on the connector WITHOUT TLS and monitor that to see what mail is coming through.  My suspicion is that there are VERY few mailservers in production that do not support TLS now.  If so, you're potentially letting third parties read your email in order to prevent missing email from legacy systems.  On my mail server, I require TLS ( opportunistic ) ALWAYS.  The only time I see an error is when someone tries to brute force passwords so I block the servers that try to use plaintext authentication at the firewall and I haven't missed any emails.  Proceed cautiously and you should be okay to require this.
Opportunistic means that you'll use TLS if it's available or if it's requested.  Mutual means that you need to have a trusted ( issued by a trusted root CA ) certificate installed on both servers.  Probably not what you want.  A lot of email servers use self-signed certificates and simply request TLS but do not request Client certificates.
I need to understand how AuthMechanism, RequireTLS and PermissionGroups relate to each other, and where RequireTLS is appropriate, as in I don't want to lose email by forcing TLS.
The "Transport Layer Security (TLS)" section of the properties dialog under the Authentication tab corresponds to opportunistic TLS.  The Mutual Auth checkbox indented underneath that is mutual auth TLS.
Integrated Windows Authentication uses built-in ( surprise! ) Windows Authentication - for example, are you logged into the Active Directory domain on a workstation?  Then Integrated Windows Authentication will use those credentials without having to include a password in your Outlook setup.  Best used for Internal Clients, not including devices.
4) Okay, I would try disabling connectors one at a time, or checking to see if their status is "Enabled," and if they're disabled, then delete them.  The names are not nearly as significant as the settings.  If you're worried that something might be overlooked, you can enable protocol logging on that connector and the check the logs to see if the connector is active.
I have multifunction printers which send scans via email, which I think also need separate connectors, and I need to know how to configure that.
Some of my existing connectors have a value for the "DistinguishedName" attribute which reads "CN=,CN=SMTP Receive Connectors,CN=Protocols,CN=,CN=Servers,CN=Exchange Administrative Group,(...),CN=Administrative Groups,CN=First Organization,CN=Microsoft Exchange,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=,DC=". I know that at one point a migration was done from Exchange 2003, and that it was not cleaned up, so to speak. I need to know if I can simply remove connectors with that value, or whether they need to be replaced with other ones.
6) You're close.  TLS is Transport Layer Security.  Think of it this way.  TLS is a like a scrambled phone line from the movies.  You can call headquarters on a scrambled line and no one can listen in, but headquarters still won't talk to you without the password of the day ( authentication ).  You'll want your internal clients to use opportunistic TLS if at all possible.  Always use TLS, is the bottom line.  Not using mutual auth will let someone pretend to be someone else, but I'm assuming you have some sort of SPAM filter in place anyway.
I have read a lot of articles and books, but nothing presents the information I need in a clear way, and some of the articles are conflicting, which is expected but doesn't make this any easier.
My Exchange server is Hub role internet-facing. There is no edge or filter between it and the outside.  
The "Name" attribute is only a label for the connector which shows in the Exchange Management Console.
The "Default" connector, as I understand it, receives email from the internet on port 25 from any IP (0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255). 
I recently implemented split DNS, and I want to know if the "Server" and "Fqdn" attributes should be changed to the public DNS name for my mail server, as in "mail.domain.com".
