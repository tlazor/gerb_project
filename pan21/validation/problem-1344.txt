If anyone can give me any pointers on where to look for potential issues, I'd be eternally grateful!
Over the past 3 weeks, a query I used to run approximately every 5 minutes has started to respond very very poorly - moving from an execution time of around 50 seconds to sometimes over 11 minutes. The data has hardly changed and returns approximately 69000 records  If I restart the service, I find the query runs very quickly the first time but subsequent runs take an age to run and lock the CPU on the server at nearly 100%. This server is used for test/development purposes so is rarely under any serious load.
This ONLY happens when I run the query from a remote machine - running the query in SQL Plus on the server and dumping the result to a file gives a 25MB text file in about 1 second which made me think I have a network problem....
I'll include the SQL statement but it is important to know that other similar queries which join the same tables are struggling to run in a timely fashion and yet run very quickly when ran locally. Again, those queries suffer from serious slow-down after their first run.
When I stop the service and use iperf.exe to transfer 25MB across the network on the same port of 1521, it takes 50 seconds no matter how many times I run it. It's not bandwidth related - Oracle just seems to choke.
