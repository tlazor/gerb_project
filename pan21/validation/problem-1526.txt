I have been reading the inventory capabilities with Ansible, and since it doesn't appear to have conditional inventory selects, I'm assuming that im going to need to use an external inventory database.  
I am designing a new ansible implement on an existing system.  The existing system is a large hardware test platform.  I need to be able to do things like:
Ansible can collect facts about your systems. Using the 'setup' module.  Run either directly as a task, or via the 'gather_facts: yes' play keyword.
As a general rule, tasks should do at least part of their own selection based on what system facts apply.
If you configure your fact caching and set gathering to be explicit, then create facts that cover all the variations of information you would want to query on, then you should be able to run plays based on cached facts, by constructing a dynamic group.
This doesn't necessarily need inventory selection, as it will only run on hosts which have the named model drive (as sda; looping through installed drives is left as an exercise to the reader).
