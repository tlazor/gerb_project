We manage our DNS/NIS hosts via an LDAP OU which in turn is used to build DNS, DHCP and the NIS hosts map dynamically every 10 minutes. This has been very useful as we have over 30 admins updating records on a daily basis.
In my experience what works best is the Master IP Spreadsheet to Rule All Others. That is, there exists one spreadsheet and it is everyone's responsibility to update it. If it ain't in the spreadsheet, it ain't live. No ifs no buts. People soon learn to update it. Also, I wouldn't use DHCP for any servers, even test ones. The last thing you want on a server is the chance that it's IP might change.
We use our documentation wiki, and map out all of our subnets in tables. If an IP is used, the documentation is updated. Now it's gotten to the point that we don't know what IPs we have available unless we consult the documentation, and thus we end up updating it. Besides, one or two IP conflicts with production equipment generally sets people straight.
What tools are available for allocating and tracking which addresses are being used?  Specifically, our issue is that sometimes an IP is taken for a VM and when we go to build new ones they're not necessarily up for the quick 'n dirty "ping test".
