This would seem like a good time to use an intersection table to implement a one-to-many relationship.
Of course it is still possible to not define any city as the capital of a country, but that is a case of missing data rather than anomalous data.
Sure, you have more tables to work with and this makes the queries a little more complicated. But think of the reduction in maintenance effort going forward knowing you never have to worry about things like multiple cities designated as the capital of the same country or a city designated as the capital of a country it doesn't even belong to. It's all trade-offs.
CountryID is the unique key field here and the capital city defined here must already be defined as a city of that country. Once that is done, no other city of that country can by similarly defined. So we can ever have only one city defined as the capital of any country and that city must already be defined as a city belonging to that country.
I always look first from a data integrity point of view when considering table designs. One problem with adding a "is the capital" indicator to the Cities table may be space but that is trivial to the anomalous conditions this makes possible. What happens when more than one city in the same country is labeled 'C' (for Capital)? What does it mean if no cities in a country are labeled?
Notice that although CityID is the PK and therefore must be unique, we still created a unique constraint on (CountryID, CityID). This makes it possible to create a table like this:
