It's hardware. You can try reapplying thermal paste to the GPU and perhaps the CPU while you're at it. If that fails, don't even bother buying a replacement part. Sell the broken hardware and put the money towards getting something that isn't HP so you get something with better ventilation and actually decent reliability.
Try running a video memory stress test. I have similar pixel errors and the cause is broken video RAM (the infamous Acer heat death, I fear). Since it cannot be exchanged in my case that means I'll have to replace the whole notebook, but if you're lucky, the video RAM is not dedicated - try memtest, if your actual RAM is broken you can replace it.
I would search on youtube for HP DV9000 blank screen fix. A massive amount of computers HP and Compaq computers with Nvidia GPUs had recalls because the chips got so hot they melted their own solder and the pins no longer made contact.  There is actually a class action lawsuit over the issue.  If your chip got that hot you may have the same situation. It is a somewhat delicate procedure but it works, I have done it myself. The youtube videos on the subject show you all you need to know.
