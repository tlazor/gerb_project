I suggest using 2008 R2 as server - has some nice features for post-image driver install IF the os deployed is R2 / win7... if not, it still is a decent WDS server.
Also, the "full disk image" from Clonezilla doesn't really care about partitions. As I understand it, it does what is essentially a 'dd' on the source drive and makes a sparse file (I think?) on the storage drive. Then when restoring from that image, it 'dd's the blocks back. 
I've tried clonezilla, but that doesn't seem to like the lack of partition table, and as far as I can tell, Acronis doesn't work either.
Other than that, I've heard that people are using Norton Ghost quite a lot for installing windows from images so you could give it a try. I've never used it though and cannot offer any advice.
I'm looking for something that can drop an image of Windows onto an uninitialized Hard Drive. I have new units that haven't even had the partition table created on them, and I'm trying to come up with a one (or two) step process for getting a disk image onto them. 
That, plus a Windows 2008 server running WDS and you can actually load a windows image from the network. Works VERY nice.
Use windows OS tools - IMAGEX (starrts with 2008 or later) can take a file based image and is pretty fast aplpying it. It also works on partitions, so size is not an issue.
