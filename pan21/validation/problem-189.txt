And you will need a lot more RAM. I would say 2gb PER DEVELOPER is a pretty good lineup (given 2+ developers). You MAY get away with less, but it is not too likely. Depends on what they actually do - but large applications in Visual Studio take a LOT of memory. Especialy during compiles, 
MY wvirtual work environment is a 4g memory Windows 7 system with Visual Studio and SQL Server. 64 bit. I use up around 3.5 gb of that REGULARLY. My Visual Studio instance alone is often around 500mb, plus debugging takes a lot of stuff, though possibly not for long. Add to that the usual culprits (help system, browsers)....
It's probably SQL server. By default (if I'm not mistaken) SQL server will allocate as much memory as it can unless specifically configured to consume a specific amount of memory (accessed in the SQL server properties). This allocated memory doesn't show up in Task Manager. What you need to do is to launch perfmon and add the "SQL Server:Memory Manager:Target Server Memory" and the "SQL Server:Memory Manager:Total Server Memory" counters and see how much memory SQL server is willing to consume and how much memory it actually is consuming.
sql server and vmware tools fight for memory space in a vm. This is probably compounded by running terminal services and vs.
The system uses a lot. Do not forget, all the screens must be rendered, and the graphics card is of no use here - so a copy of all the memory buffer has to go in (which can be a lot - what resolutions, how many screens do we talk here?, given 2003 I assume one per developer)
You may also want to configure the options within sql server to ensure it only allocates part of the system's ram. Maybe 2gb max.
...you are criminally low to start with. The machine you note is good for maybe one developer in active use. Two if not a lot is used.
If you haven't already, go into the vm's settings and create a full 4Gb memory reservation under the resources tab. This'll prevent the baloon driver attempting to reclaim memory within the vm.
