You can't know when something will go wrong, but you can assess the risks (not to have precise infos, but to get a sense of what can go wrong and why it's good to prevent it with redundancy and with regular transfer to other mediums before the prior mediums fails): 
To "scare" you even more, you could say now that P(one disk fails within 20 years)=0.99 (20 years is a long time for a drive. And even if it works, the devices to read them may not be able to handle them)
Similar to @longneck's suggestion, but slightly different: backup to Amazon S3, or Google Cloud Storage, etc. (I recommend NOT using Amazon's Glacier if you are looking for a warm backup for your data, since you will be paying through your nose for fast data restoration from Glacier. For more on Glacier's retrieval fee, there's great discussion on Hacker News.)
Imagine that you have similar disks and that you can say that the probability of 1 failing within 2 years is 5%
Hard Drives (actually, any storage medium) ages, and some have defects, and some gets bumped (for example, a little knock with a screwdriver or against another drive while storing them on a shelf could yeld enough G to scratch a disk's surface, and this will cause failure either now or within a short-to-not-long-enough timeframe). Which means: your backup media will fail, some within days, others within years, with no means to know when.
And in addition to all this: if you buy all the drives at the same vendor, P(one of those disk fails after another failed) is very high, much higher than the P(one disk fails) : disks are built similarly, so if one fails, chances that the others in the same batch will fail around the same time is high (or very high) !
You can combine both, but off-site usually takes some time to retrieve (unless you also have off-site office, or access to it via some means, check with your off-site backup providers)
In addition to the cost and "infinite growing storage", you also get fine-grained ACL and permissioning for your data. Amazon offers IAM for ACL control, and I suspect other providers offer similar control.
Finally, these cloud storage services give you really powerful APIs to read/write and do other things with your data. You may find this useful for automating some backup tasks.
Amazon S3 costs you $0.095 per GB for starters (it used to cost $0.125 per GB, but Amazon just dropped it a week ago). Google's Cloud Storage and other services are probably in the same price range.
You need to imagine: what happens if I can't access part of my data? Usually this could mean you go out of business! (You can't just rely on the hope that that small part that fails will not be the core data necessary for your company's operation, for example.)
You rotate them on-site, mirror to them  and have them stored off-site at a secure storage facility.
You don't really mention the SIZE of the 72 drives, but if it's really critical then you should at least have a backup at a remote location.  Media rated firesafes are great for protecting the data on-site, but what if your building is a total loss.  As in, everything is gone, including the safe.  If you do start utilizing off-site or online backups, make sure that their building/ data center isn't close enough to yours, that they could both be destroyed at once. 
In english : if you have 72 disks, and if you can say that a single disk have a 5% probability of failing within 2 years, then you'll have more than 97% chance you have a disk failure within 2 years. This is not at all precise, but it should show you that things can go wrong, and faster than usually expected...
Similar to tape backup but may cost out better depending on your data volumes and data production volume per week.
