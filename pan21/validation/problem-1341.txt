Usually providers block private IP communications with each other (this is called Intra APN communication) the reason is quite obvious: Security. If the subscribers are in the same private network, they likely might be able to access each others IP/ports including Windows shared folders that might not be password protected. Have you tried to ping from one IP to another?
I will assume that each of the modems have a private IP address and they're NAT through the internet by your provider using a public IP address.
I'm not sure if this is exactly your case but I work for a telco provider and I managed the Packet Switching (PS) Core team for more than 2 years and we dealt a few times with scenarios like those.
2) Connect to an external public IP (VPN/Proxy) responsible to switch the data between the two GSM nodes.
The problem is that I can't get either modem to receive incoming UDP traffic from the other. The provider is NAT'ing both devices and I can't do any port forwarding within the GSM provider's router. It looks like the GSM provider blocks incoming connections to both devices, so how can I do socket communication? I've thought about setting up a FTP/web/email server to relay traffic between the two devices, but I'd rather do it with socket (TCP or UDP). Any ideas?
1) Buy a private APN from your telco provider. This will allow your SIM cards to communicate freely with each other but not to the world. This is usually a corporate service and for individuals might be a little costly.
I have 2 internet-connected 4G modems connected to 2 separate computers and I'd like to send/receive data between them with sockets (UDP) using the modems' packet-switched 4G Internet connection, not using AT commands to dial each other.
