I have confirmed that my processor, a non-k INTEL i7-3770 (per ark.intel.com/products/65719), supports VT-d:
I have ensured that VT-d is enabled via my motherboard's BIOS.  As such, I do not suspect hardware/BIOS issues that would prevent the use of VT-d.  Regardless, I am unable to successfully detach my video card from my host and reassign it to a virtual machine.
I cannot find CONFIG_DMAR_DEFAULT_ON in /boot/config-`uname -r` on my system.  Further research suggests that CONFIG_DMAR, CONFIG_DMAR_DEFAULT_ON, and CONFIG_PCI_STUB are Linux kernel configuration items that are relevant to the instructions on linux-kvm.org.  As such I believe that I need to recompile my host's kernel with these 3 (at least) kernel config items.  Booting with intel_iommu=on as a kernel parameter to my host-OS appears to be insufficient.
At this point I think my issue is related to my kernel.  My primary resource has been the guide at linux-kvm.org (http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/How_to_assign_devices_with_VT-d_in_KVM).  However, I have found other resources which indicate slightly different methods that are (seemingly) distribution specific:
I am guessing this is because the host still will not relinquish control of the video card and is likely due to the kernel not being compiled with the appropriate configuration items.
I am attempting to use PCI-Passthrough to attach an old video card (Radeon 4770) to a virtual machine.  I am using Linux-KVM to run my virtual machines on a Debian Linux (Wheezy, 3.2.0-4-amd64) host.  
To clarify, I am not sure what the correct 'path' is for implmenting PCI-Passthrough with Linux KVM.  At this stage I suspect the correct action is to add CONFIG_DMAR, CONFIG_DMAR_DEFAULT_ON, and CONFIG_PCI_STUB to the "Bus options (PCI etc.)" section of the kernel source and recompile.
This is new territory for me so please forgive my inexperience.  I would greatly appreciate any feedback whatsoever, even if it is simply confirmation that I am on the right track.  Please let me know if I have made a glaring oversight or am over-thinking.  Constructive criticism of my question is welcome as well.  Let me know if I have not provided enough information to "help you help me" (or if I've included too much!).  I would be more than happy to help make my question clearer or easier to answer.
Of the guides I have referenced, only linux-kvm.org explicitly mentions compiling is necessary.  Linux-KVM is already installed and functioning as a hypervisor.
But I am not sure if this is an exhaustive list of necessary additions before recompliling. Or if recompiling the kernel is necessary--perhaps there is an easier method?
The Fedora guide works until referencing setsebool which appears to be RedHat-specific. The SUSE guide indicates graphics-card assignment is not supported by SUSE, however I am referencing it as well because it indicated I should find a CONFIG_DMAR_DEFAULT_ON string within /boot/config-`uname -r`. The linux-kvm.org site also references CONFIG_DMAR_DEFAULT_ON, so this appears to be a common and necessary component.
