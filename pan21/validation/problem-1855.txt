We are discussing the potential of issuing standardized VM images to our staff to use when connecting to our corporate network from their personal computers.
What would be the best/simplest way to allow the VM to connect to our corporate network, while at the same time prevent the host computer from connecting?  
If these VMs will be joined to a domain, perhaps you can utilize client certificates on your VPN such that only computers which have a client certificate can connect to the VPN. That will prevent unauthorized computers from connecting (hosts) while allowing authorized ones to do so (VM's). While the VM is on the VPN, you can enforce it to only allow traffic to the destination network to prevent split horizon traffic. If you have a user who is tech savvy enough, they'll be able to get around it, but the same goes for most solutions.
To prevent the hosts from accessing resources I think you may have to look at using IPSec for Domain or Server Isolation.  The hosts won't be in the domain, so IPSec will prevent them from communicating with the other Domain machines, but the VMs will be in the domain so they can communicate with each other.
Ideally they could run this VM on any hardware they have available.  Since we wouldn't control the hardware or host OS, there would be the fairly high potential of malware infestations, restricted software, bad software interactions, etc. on the host.
for preventing ethernet and wireless access from rogue devices, you can either make everyone VPN into the secured zone, or deploy 802.1x.
This looks like a really good starting point. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/james_morey/archive/2005/04/21/410590.aspx
