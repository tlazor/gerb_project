As a minimum, you should allow to pass icmp types 3 (destination unreachable), 4 (source quench) and 11 (time exceeded). All of these types are used to deal with network problems and shouldn't be filtered.
ICMP is used for a range of diagnostic (eg ping, traceroute) and network control (eg PMTU discovery) functions.  Indiscriminate blocking of ICMP causes other people all sorts of heartburn, and unless you know exactly what you're doing, you should leave it alone.
It also allows you to use connections elsewhere on the internet that use smaller MTUs than are on your network.  If you try to send a packet somewhere that's too large and can't be fragmented, the device drops the packet and sends an ICMP fragmentation needed packet back to the sender.  If you drop all ICMP packets, you lose those and weird things happen on your network.
The real question is "why block ICMP?"  What do you gain?  Just have good filtering rules at your border and in front of your valued assets.
I've never understood why people clock ICMP, as said above it only ever causes headaches to yourself and others. You can determine if a host is up easily enough and so long as it is limited enough as not to be used as a DOS then I've never heard any compelling reasons to block it. (If someone can come up with a reason please post)
