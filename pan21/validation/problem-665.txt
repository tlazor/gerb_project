I've got an HP zd8000 (17") laptop which has a pretty much full size keyboard.  I've used about a dozen other laptops over the years, both work and personal, and have never had a better, more responsive, better feeling keyboard for a laptop.  I've tried a couple other HP 17" laptops as demos and both had similar feel to the keyboards.  The only problem was with the touchpad.  I tend to rest my wrist on the surface below the keyboard while I type and this would cause the right hand to contact the touchpad and make the cursor wander off to the topright corner somewhere or randomly click and highlight things, but that's more my bad habits than anything.
Toshiba has plenty of great 15" and 17" satellite laptops. And, if your Macbook Pro is still under warranty take it to the Apple Store for repairs. No need to waste a computer :)
Some people don't like the new Lenovo keyboards, but the one on my W500 is pretty nice. The trackpad will probably be on the small side for you given that you're probably used to the massive one on the MacBooks, but having the choice between a trackpad and the red "nipple" pointer between G and H is cool.
I've never found a 15" with a keyboard I like and pretty much universally will only use those with an external USB keyboard except when absolutely necessary.  Also, avoid Sony laptops.  Have worked with three different ones and they were all three the worst keyboards I've ever worked with.
