IP packet routing is fairly complex, and the key to understanding it is to know that virtually every router does not know exactly where the packet is going. It just knows that that router over there knows better than it does so send the packet over to them. You could use the analogy of following a concentration gradient for a pheromone.
EDIT: There are different routing schemes. What a router does is takes an incoming packet and passes it along to some other device (other router, switch, computer) based on the routing scheme. You can read an intro to some routing schemes here. For a simple explanation, imagine that each router has a routing table with IPs and subnets. Each entry in the routing table has a key (the packet destination IP), and a value (the immediate outgoing IP or subnet). When deciding where to pass an incoming packet, it takes the IP of the packet and searches in the routing table, which gives the immediate destination. The question of when and how these routing tables are constructed is even broader.
(0. MAC addresses are network local and depend on everything being Ethernet anyway. The high-capacity links most certainly aren't Ethernet, but instead use different protocols over optical fiber.)
But seriously, you need to read about networking and TCP/IP and this answer is not scientific and fully correct.
First: That's why they are called routers - they route. They take the responsibility of passing along your packets, your packet doesn't know the route, only the destination
