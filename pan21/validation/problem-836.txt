3) Allow ICMP traffic if you need to be able to communicate among on-premises systems and instances or resources in GCP using ping.
With traceroute from GCP end, you will not get usable information instead I would try it from on-prem end to make sure traffic destined to GCP going through the on-prem end of VPN tunnel.
I would also recommend you to consult the "Checking connectivity" section of the GCP VPN Troubleshooting document which has some good suggestions relevant to your scenario.
I would start by confirming that this communication is allowed in your on-prem network. As per GCP documentation on "On-premises rules" the recommendations are:
2) Permit all protocols and ports, or you may restrict traffic to only the necessary set of protocols and ports to meet your needs.
4) On-premise firewall rules can be implemented by both your network devices (for example, security appliances, firewall devices, switches, routers, and gateways) and in software running on your systems (such as firewall software included with an operating system). All firewalls “in the way” to GCP must be configured appropriately to allow traffic.
1) Configure rules to allow egress and ingress traffic to and from the IP ranges used by the subnets in your GCP network.
