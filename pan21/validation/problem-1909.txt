Arxiv is not very useful for computational complexity, although certain subfields such as quantum computing do use it.  On the whole, there is no quality control at all, and many of the papers listed as belonging to computational complexity are either incorrect, or only marginally related to the field.  ECCC (Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity) reports are usually much more germane, and mostly by experts in the area.  There are only a few each week, and cover a wide variety of topics.  So I recommend looking at new ECCC reports, at least glancing at abstracts, and perhaps reading more if they look interesting.
Another resource you can use is Oded Goldreich's list of ``Papers I find interesting'' or something like that, off his homepage.  He gives a summary and discussion of stuff he likes.  The additions are irregular, and seem to average one or two a month.  
You are also welcome to come to talks at IAS any time.  I could add you to the mailing list if you are not already on it....
