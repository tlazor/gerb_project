However, this creates a big time sink for our (very small) IT    department whenever we need to do any kind of maintenance on the    field machines.  I'd love to see us save some time with a tool or set    of practices that will allow us to better manage these systems    remotely, even if it is something as simple as managing updates,    running commands, or pushing Firefox out to everyone.
My home office uses a Windows domain that hosts about 25 nodes.     There are 17 locations out in the field (70% Windows XP, 30% Windows    7) with anywhere from 4-10 computers that are not joined to this    domain and don't exist on a domain.  We had decided early on the cost    to create and manage the infrastructure to hook into our home office    domain was not enough to justify what little we needed it for (they    all connect to our web application to do their work anyways.)
What are some good tools/practices to manage this problem for about 150 remote, non-domain nodes?  Any software solutions should be recommended knowing that we are a small company with a constrained IT budget.
