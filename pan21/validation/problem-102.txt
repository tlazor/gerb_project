For client machines use Group Policy to adjust how often your clients check the domain for time: Computer Configuration: Administrative Templates:System:Windows Time Service:Global Configuration Settings -> Update Interval (in seconds).
I can't say for certain, but it sounds like the Windows NTP daemon is horribly broken (at least in your case).  Have you tried disabling it and running a third-party NTP daemon?
It is worth noting that if you are using the Windows system clock to gauge time, its resolution is typically limited to 10 or 15 milliseconds (i.e. it only updates once every 10 or 15 milliseconds) in most cases.
Â±5ms is a pretty tight tolerance IMHO (though I'm not doing anything time-critical so I'm happy if my clocks are on the same second), but NTP should easiy be able to keep you within a second if everything is working correctly.  The only exception would be if your local clock is horribly broken (and by that I mean wild swings and almost NO frequency stability -- Modern NTP daemons are very good at adjusting for some sloppiness in the local clock).
If you have a domain, the workstations should pull time from the Domain controllers.  So if you have the domain controllers setup to a reliable Internet clock source (http://www.pool.ntp.org/) then the clients should stay in time.
To get your domain controllers setup for a external Internet clock, check out: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816042 and skip down to the section on "Configuring the Windows Time service to use an external time source"
Yes. It can. My company wrote software that will synchronize clocks more accurate than that. Sadly I can't open source it. If it is a 32bit windows box, than you can use Automachron for this, and I can confirm it works.
