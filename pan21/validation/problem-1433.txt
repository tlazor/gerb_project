The last one might be the best one to try in the case of a docking station, where space between USB connectors is usually tight.
USB 3.0 has been interfering. I disconnected the mass storage device adapter connected to the USB 3.0 back plane and now I have no problems with my wireless keyboard and mouse.
I too had two Logitech mice that were hanging in Win7 and Win10. I resolved much of the issue by replacing the mouse pad.  My old pad had a very slick surface.  I replaced it with a new Staples (brand unimportant) mouse pad with one of those surfaces that is textured like fabric.  Mouse works a lot better. 
From Intel's note on USB 3.0 Radio Frequency Interference on 2.4 GHz Devices (page links to the full PDF download):
Moving the mouse receiver from the back of the computer to a USB port on the front solved this for me.
On the old computers the mice worked smoothly, but on the new ones mouse behavior was erratic (sticky and jerky). As soon as I moved the mouse receivers from rear USB ports to front USB ports, the problem went away on both machines.
I recently got new desktop computers, with Win 10/64-bit, at work and at home. The old computers were running Win XP/32-bit, and each had a Logitech M510 mouse with the receiver plugged into a USB port on the back panel.
