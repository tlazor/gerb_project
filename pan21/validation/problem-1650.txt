id appuser will likely show you that the shell still sees the old UID for the user.  Logout and log back in.
OK! I have got it. Found it on Bing after trying many times. Still not certain exactly WHICH thing fixed by problem, of two possibilities. But here they are.
Therefore, if you want to see appuser as the owner, you will have to change the ownership of the files from 502 to 506. And you may have to do that on the server if you do not have permissions on the client.
There is "tell" on the internet that there can be client ownership permission problems with NFS v4. I don't know if that's true, and I don't care. Somebody had something they called a solution. So I followed the instructions to force the client to mount the drive as NFS version 3. So the first thing I did was change my mount line permissions in /etc/fstab from this:
Then, because I was following some dated instructions, I checked to see if the portmap service was running on the client:
File ownership is saved with user ids. When you were looking at those files and seeing them as owned by appuser before the 502 -> 506 change, they were actually owned by user id 502 (ls -n will confirm). This has not changed.
How to change the permissions is a different topic. If you do not have access to the server you can try copying the files using your new user (assuming you have read only access) and removing them later. It may be easier if you temporarily create a user with id 502 which will be able to change the permissions (but not the ownership) of the files owned by 502, rename them, or remove them after you copy them.
