The reason for the dropped connections might be a firewall that is overloaded or configured to be overly strict in cleaning up idle connections, somewhere between your SSH connection target and the ultimate target of the forwarded ports.
“Administratively prohibited” is also one of the ICMP control messages. Is it possible a router between the SSH server and the tunnel destination is sending this?
Once a firewall judges a connection to have been idle for long enough, it may just drop the connection information from its connection state table. If either endpoint of the connection attempts to pass any traffic after that, the firewall will reject the connection (on behalf of the intended destination) since you're apparently attempting to use an existing connection but the firewall no longer has the state tracking information for that connection. So the firewall rejects the packets with an ICMP error message, hence "administratively prohibited".
As I use autossh to create a tunnel, I needed two ports: one for connection (10000) and one for monitoring (10001). The problem came with monitoring port.
I had the same problem using authorized_keys with permitopen. On server side, /var/log/auth.log contained:
Is there a chance you're encountering a bad link? I'm pretty baffled at that message-the only other thing I could think of was a memory issue-do you have plenty of free RAM on the box you're sshed into?
