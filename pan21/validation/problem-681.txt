Two years ago, I heard that Rod and Mike were going to bring out a second edition of their book -- may be it is out now.  Mike's website http://www.mrfellows.net should have more info.  You can sign up for his mailing list (newsletter) which comes out every 2-3 months.
Sorry for the self-advertisement, but this spring we have been developing a hybrid undergrad/grad course at Stanford on Parameterized Algorithms and Complexity. We've tried to "re-do" many of the proofs of the core theorems in the literature, in a way that's somewhat more accessible to undergraduates. The scribe notes are (mostly) online. However we have not carefully edited all of them, so I would not take the notes as gospel yet.
I would like to learn about Parametrized Complexity (both on the algorithmic side and on the hardness side). What books/lecture notes can I read on this subject?
A relatively new textbook is by Marek Cygan, Fedor V. Fomin, Łukasz Kowalik, Daniel Lokshtanov, Dániel Marx, Marcin Pilipczuk, Michał Pilipczuk, and Saket Saurabh https://www.springer.com/in/book/9783319212746
