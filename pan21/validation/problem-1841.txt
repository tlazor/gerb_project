Your problem is that when you type ping 0x7f000001, the ping program evaluates that as an IP address instead of a hostname.  The ping program cannot read your mind, it does not know that the valid IP address you told it to ping is also a hostname, and it evaluates whether it is an IP first.
Short of recompiling ping to behave the way you think it should, try pinging the FQDN 0x7f000001.example.com.
You have a server whose nodename is 0x7f000001.  Its FQDN is 0x7f000001.example.com.  0x7f000001 is also a valid IP address, represented also as decimal 2130706433, 0b1111111000000000000000000000001, or dotted-quad 127.0.0.1.
I want to introduce a domain name to the equation, so I'm going to use example.com in lieu of actually knowing what your local domain is.
Imagine if you will that you created a hostname 127, put it in the zone 0.0.1.example.com, and make example.com your default search domain.  According to your logic, it should then be valid to type ping 127.0.0.1 and have ping not use the IP 127.0.0.1 but instead use the A record pointed to by the FQDN 127.0.0.1.example.com, which is silly.
