Now I know the reason why my computer started waking up at 3:59 a.m.  Because I accidentally clicked on the Windows Live TV icon by mistake and turned it on for the first time ever a few days ago. Never have used it before until now, by accident.  STUPID Windows crap.

My suggestion would be to check your Task Scheduler in windows 8 and see if any tasks (usually updates) are set to start around 3:00am and disable them.
Right there you will see the settings that is so arrogantly starts your PC in the middle of the night. You can either disable automatic wake up or change the time.
My problem was resolved and found by using the third from last solution posted here, which was given by Jason Bristol. "Scheduled task event"
