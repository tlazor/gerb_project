Packets for unreachable networks that aren't explicitly marked as unreachable in the route table will just keep being forwarded via the default routes, until the packet either reaches a router that explicitly knows the network is unreachable, or the TTL expires.
Now, my desktop won't even try to ask the default gateway about addresses in that range.  Lookups for that address immediately return "No route to host."
It's only packets for networks that aren't explicitly in the table that will go to the default route.  You can explicitly mark a network as unreachable by:
Note the 172.17.0.0/16 and 172.18.0.0/16.  Packets to these networks will go straight to my docker bridges, without ever leaving my computer, because they have a specific entry in my route table.  The 192.168.1.0/24 entry explicitly says traffic to that network will go out the enp5s0 interface.  My router's route table will have a similar entry that will send all traffic for that private network out the interface my desktop is connected to.
As a point of clarification from the other answers, private IP address ranges that you are using locally do not route to the Internet because they have their own explicit entries in the routing table.  Here's my route table from my desktop at home, for example:
