When I ssh into a server (4.3.3-2-ARCH), my .bashrc is not loaded (however, I can load it manually by sourcing it). 
If your ~/.bash_profile contains the above and ~/.bashrc is not being loaded you can debug the scripts by using set -x as usual.
Normally when a user is created it will copy a bunch of files to your new homedirectory (if you chose to create one). 
You can check the /etc/skel directory for those files. There should be the .bash_profile that you expected. 
For login shells (amongst others) ~/.bash_profile is read. Typically your ~/.bash_profile contains something like
In SSH verbose mode, I do see that /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc are loaded using the last command. When using the default ssh command, none of them is being loaded...
What should I configure to have .bashrc (and /etc/bash.bashrc) loaded when using the default ssh command?
As none of the previous, it seemd that the user didn't have a shell assigned, so it just show the character $ as prompt.
the ~/.bashrc file is loaded for interactive non-login shells, that's why running /bin/bash from ssh works as you expect.
