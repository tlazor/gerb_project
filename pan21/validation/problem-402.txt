It would be possible for manufacturers to give more detailed RF specifications for each device, but it won't tell you the range, it would just be a bunch of stuff you'd have to become an amateur RF engineer to understand. Products designed to be professionally installed for outdoor applications usually come with this kind of information so the RF engineers at the installation company can estimate what the device should be capable of in very carefully controlled conditions. But it wouldn't be meaningful or helpful to most home users in most home environments.
Nope, it's not possible to list the device's range in its spec. There are too many real-world variables involved for even the best RF engineers to know exactly what range you'll get in your particular scenario. Off the top of my head, here are just a few of the variables that affect range between device A and device B:
And since Wi-Fi is bi-directional, you can flip all those things above and end up with twice as many variables. Plus there's the RF characteristics of the materials (walls, etc.) between A and B, and the RF noise on channel in your environment, and the multipath environment (how many different paths the signals can take between A and B), and there's how humid the air is (water attenuates 2.4 GHz signals quite effectively).
So, nope, it just isn't possible for a device to give a meaningful guess at what kind of range you'll get out of it in your environment, especially since the makers of Device A not only don't know your environment, but they don't know the specs of Device B that's going to be on the other end of the link, and the specs of the link-partner are critical to the range.
