It's also quite simple to implement, because you only have to add an additional DNS entry 'www.mydomain.com' pointing to the second server IP address
We have a Windows 2016 Server VPS that works as download server. users request file with URL and download from those. I'm using asp.net as web application and IIS as web server.
You also have DNS traffic manager (like Azure DNS or F5 GTM), which can monitor each server availability. But they have significant costs, and are more appropriate for big geographically-distributed applications (in different countries / world regions)
On the opposite, if you need fault tolerance, there are load balancing solutions like HAProxy , which can do load balancing at TCP and HTTP level. You can install it on a server dedicated to that role
Now I want to increase number of server to 3 or more and i don't know how to handle request to Load balance and fault tolerance of this server.
If you only need simple and cost-free load balancing without fault tolerance and session affinity, DNS round-robin on your 2 or 3 download servers would be an adequate solution
Does it write choice for my problem? what technique use middle-size(not GoogleDrive or DropBox) company at this moment?
Now after 2 years from beginning, number of download request increased and I afraid maybe one server can't handle all request at same time.
