Your drive is already doing this - every drive these days has some cache built in, because if it only fetched exactly what you asked for, one chunk at a time it would be horribly inefficient. The SSD layer in a hybrid drive is just extending that concept. 
But it also works fine for other types of data. It's quite easy to predict that if you've starting to stream a video off your HDD, it's -likely- that you'll want the rest of the video quite soon, and therefore premptively cache it. 
If you want the second drive to be fast get another ssd, if you want sometimes fast but lots more room get the hybrid. Just be aware how caching works - it improves read access to collections of files that you open or access repeatedly, or need to open really fast. So if you don't use a program frequently it wont get cached rendering your hybrid drive nothing more that a regular drive. And in case you want just an extra storage space, then just get a HDD.
Think of a hybrid drive as a normal drive with a very large cache. This cache is populated with things your drive guesses you might be wanting, making those things fast to access.
There's a variety of mechanisms by which guessing takes place, but for most purposes, you can use a very simple frequency of use algorithm. This works nicely for OS files, as there's certain things your system accesses a lot.
