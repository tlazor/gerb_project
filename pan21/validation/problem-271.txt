Am i missing anything? Or is the XFCE desktop, the only one that works properly? I have googled plenty of vnc tutorials/forums etc, and i read lots of problems and weird issue's regarding a proper functioning gnome or ubuntu desktop.
It all seems rather incomplete to me, and it has probably somethings to do with my xstarup file. I tried many examples from the internet for xstartup files. This is the closest as i could get for a proper working ubuntu desktop. If only i could get the menus working like it should, i would be really happy. So if anyone has any idea's of what could be wrong? Do i have missing packages? Are it just bugs? Any tip or hint is very much welcome. 
For the last days i have been experimenting a lot with remote desktops. For our company we want to install ubuntu 16.04 desktop on a headless server. I succeeded in installing tightvnc server which gives me unique desktops for each employee, along with graphical ubuntu desktops. But things are not working as it should. And a lot of things seem not be working correctly.
