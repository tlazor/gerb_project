Remember that the 'C$' share is an administrative share, ie. only visible and accessible by administrators. So unless the service account running the Jenkins service has local admin permissions on 192.168.1.210, you're going to get this error -- because it actually cannot find the specified path.
Bsaed on the fact that it starts with a single backslash in the error message, it looks like an escaping problem. PowerShell has an annoying habit of treating anything that begins with a backslash \ as a regular expression.
I'm using BITS to transfer file from one windows 2008 R2 server to the other. When I run the command manually from powershell or regular command line it works perfectly. Now when I use the same command as part of a build script in Jenkins it fails with the following error :
As landonz replied, at first, that can't be done. But that actually can be done, if you're willing to go through the hoops.
Confirming again, the above powershell script works perfectly fine when i trigger it manually myself using powershell or windows command.
Jenkins runs as a windows service under "Local System" account. I thought changing the windows service to run under "Network Service" account might help, but that's not the case either.
Alternatively, you could try sharing out the 'Website' folder as a non-administrative share and see if Network Service can access that. (You might then need to give the source computer accout NTFS access to the folder).
Try running the Jenkins service as a domain account that has local Admin on the target server as a test, and you should see the behavior change. Then you would just need to determine what permissions your Jenkins service account needs.
Read this: Service Accounts and BITS - "... You can use BITS to transfer files from a service. The service must use the LocalSystem, LocalService, or NetworkService system account. These accounts are always logged on; therefore, jobs submitted by a service using these accounts always run. ..."
