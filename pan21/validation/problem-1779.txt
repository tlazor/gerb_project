The problem as far as I see is that your server is not responding in any way, which makes me think that there might be a firewall that is dropping all traffic to port 80 in front of your server. Open that port for connections from the internet in the FW and likely you would have your site online. Alternatively, if there is a sort of a proxy between the internet and the web server, that might also be badly configured.
Your domain is well visible from the internet, as far as I see, for nslookup imsingh.com and nslookup www.imsingh.com I get the IP address you mentioned. To properly be able to test it yourself, you need to use an external connection so that you do not end up using your local network interfaces.
The first problem to solve (if you want to run your own nameservers) is to find someone willing to act as a secondary nameserver [ or another identically configured primary server ].
I think you are experiencing multiple problems, the first one is with DNS.  While your local nameserver is working, this is not being read externally.  There are, I suspect, 2 reasons for this.
First off, in order to run your own nameservers most TLD's (for example .com) require a minimum of 2 nameservers, and you only appear to have 1 configured - so it won't allow you to register this.
Secondly you have an issue with "glue records".  Because you are wanting to us a subdomain (ns1.mysingh.com) as domain name server for register mysingh.com there is a problem that the root server does not know where to find ns1.mysingh.com because it does does not know how to reach mysingh.com.    In order to fix this you need to either use different domain name (which the root nameservers know - for example godaddys) and then point the A records to your site, bypassing your nameservers, or you need to get your registrar to register your nameservers as "glue records", which are hardcoded IP addresses associated with the nameservers in the root zone file.
