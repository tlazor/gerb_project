Windows doesn't have a proper keyboard layout for this, unless you use a Windows US International (then you can use the [right-alt]+[5]. The problem is that every time you want to type an ', `, " and so on, you'll have to enter a space or it'll try to put some accents on the following character.
If you opt to use Linux as a free alternative to Windows, you can install a normal US keyboard layout with the â‚¬ symbol on 5, without any other inconveniences. They've had this for years and I still don't understand why Microsoft is still being so fussy about it. There are A LOT OF Belgian and Dutch users facing this problem.
My laptop has a euro sign on the '5-key'. However, when I press Ctrl + Alt + 5 no euro symbol is inserted. What could be the cause of this?
You can also install the normal and international keyboard and switch between the layouts when needed.
If I had some programming skills, I'd create the layout myself because it's bloody annoying! It doesn't matter which version of Windows you're running, they all face the same problem.
