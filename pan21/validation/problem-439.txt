If you're asking which is more easily migrated to another server: software RAID. All you need is enough SATA ports. If your hardware controller breaks, this often leads to issues, and you'd better have a spare handy.
If you're asking what happens to your data in case of unexpected shutdown, hardware RAID has better protection against that, if you have battery backup. Software RAID often times has to initiate a full rebuild, unless you have a write-intent bitmap, which slows things down.
In short, I strongly favor Linux MDRAID rather than cacheless hardware RAID: its code is open, in contrast of the bynary blobs found inside hardware RAID cards. That said, a proper hardware RAID with a generous FBWC can be required to hit higher performance.
Rather than software vs hardware RAID, the different behaviors are due to the presence (or absence) of a powerloss protected cache:
In this case, if I want to transfer my RAID10 cluster to another server, what happens if it is a software RAID or a hardware RAID?
