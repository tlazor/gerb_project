Forget RoboCopy, or xcopy, or whatever.   Windows7 will allow you to map a drive letter to a FTP service.   FTP is fast.    Then use NULL FTP Server  to run a ftp site on on the remote machine.   Also, you can write a DOS script to push/pull files from the location in a automated fashion, if thats what you need.
This kind of slowness is usually caused by a misbehaving\misconfigured network interface. If the auto negotiation between the network interface and the switch doesn't work properly( and often this is the case) the network interface will use wrong duplex setting. Somehow it allows network traffic to flow but very slowly. Check the NIC configuration and the network port configuration and make sure they are synchronized.
Specifically, my problem was that file transfers FROM Windows 7 to XP were slow, measured by seeing network utilization in the Task Manager at about 1%. Transfers from XP to Windows 7 typically used 80-99% of the network bandwidth. These results were achieved whether the transfer was "push" or "pull".
What worked for me: I went to Local Area Network properties, Configure, Advanced Tab, and disabled Large Send Offload v2. The advice to disable autotuning, RSS, set Speed & Duplex to a specific value, remove from homegroup, did nothing. Ultimately, the settings which worked on my Dell XPS 8100 Windows 7 Pro 64-bit workstation were as follows:
I found a good lead on another board ( http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itpronetworking/thread/c30f6649-a0d9-4f5e-8671-904a8f5469bb ). Since the problem had a lot of leads which didn't work, I thought I'd cross-post a solution that worked for me.
