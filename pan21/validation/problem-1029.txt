What version of Exchange are you using? Do you know what mail system they are using? You will need to do a message trace to see what happened along the way. Although it could have been a synchronisation issue with their mail client, and the 'check' message could have triggered a send/receive. Has anyone else been affected by this issue?
It was caused by space shortage on the partition, which in term was caused by Hyper-V bug that shrinks the 'expanding' Virtual HD to the size of it's content. I restarted the server and the VHD returned to it's original size. To prevent similar errors I converted the 'expanding' VHD to 'fixed' VHD.
This could be due to any number of factors, anywhere along the way between her mail client and the recipient's. This would include their mail system, yours, any spam filters or gateways in between, and any relays the messages are passing through.
I have seen this happen due to improper firewall rules between the exchange server and the client. Normally the server sends a notification to the client when new mail has arrived, causing the client to go download new messages. If this notofication packet is blocked, the behavior you described can happen.
