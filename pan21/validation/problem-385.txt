Also, when you say you want 6 servers, is that a 3-server MySQL cluster and a 3-Server apache cluster, or do you have something else in mind?
Another option is to buy used from some place like CraigsList.org... find someone swapping out their older hardware, etc. and pick up a server for cheap.
I know you said you want to use VMWARE but you can get citrix xen server for free. The free edition is fully functional with its own vm center equivalent for free.
Also, whatever virtualization technology you are using, make sure you install the tools (ie. vmware tools, virtualbox tools), as they make everything more efficient and faster.
Mattering on what you want to run in those VMs, you could do it on your desktop running Linux and OpenVZ.  It's a lot lighter weight than (say) VMWare.
You should be able to do this all on one box, if you aren't expecting any great traffic to the server.
Assuming that this home server farm is a TEST/development area you should be able to run six VMs on one or two quad core processors with as much RAM/Disk as you require.
You don't say what stack you're intending on using.  If it is a standard LAMP stack without a gui, everything should be quite usable on a single server.  If you're talking IIS/Windows, perhaps not.
Once again... I don't know what your budget is but new hardware is SO cheap... its almost a shame not to buy a new. :-)
