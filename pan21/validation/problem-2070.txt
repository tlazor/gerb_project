3) Configure app and service specific clustering. Say DC replicate on their own, SQL Server has AGs, Exchange got DAG, file servers prefers DFS-R (if you’re fine with notoriously annoying lack of locks, but that’s another story...) and so on.
The most of the services from Microsoft can be configured in active-standby and even active-active way. For example, DNS server can be replicated using built-in technologies, same for DHCP, Active Directory. Maybe even building Failover Cluster for high availability and any SDS for its replication?
In case you choose a service native failover, you will have to configure replication/failover for every service, one by one. DNS through DNS replication (primary/secondary or AD integrated - and set the 2nd IP as alternate dns in your clients), AD through a second DC (make sure you have two global catalogs!) and a fileserver through a regular file copy interval (MDB is not readable when beeing written in) or DFS (which I would set up).
1) Upgrade to at least WS2016, there’s no point in messing up with ancient and soon to be unsupported tech (WS2008 & 2012).
There is no solution for a "just Failover everything" case within a running (hardware) server. The world would be a much more reliable place, if someone would invent that :-)
2) Virtualize! There’s no point in bare metal deployments unless your primary business app vendor is living under the rock and doesn’t support virtualization in 2019 for whatever reason.
