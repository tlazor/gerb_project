Sounds like you'll want to get the highest end shuttle you can afford to fit your quad core processor and extra RAM.  If you really need RAID you may need an add-in card for that.
I've been using a XPC Shuttle with an add in $100 video card.  I've got my loaded with 4GB of RAM and a large SATA hard disk.  It's running 64-bit Kubuntu and I can also run Windows side by side with Linux using virtualbox should you need it.
I prefer HPs over Dell's simply because HP's Technical Support wins heavily over Dell's 2 hour call-time average, and 3-4 year product lifetime. We currently uses HP laptops and desktops for virtually all of our non-linux/solaris machines.
Have you thought about getting an iMac and putting Windows and / or Linux on there using Bootcamp?  The 27" model meets most of your requirements, especially for being quiet, and for having good build quality.  They also have decent graphics hardware for a non-gamer-dedicated system.
I would reccomend an HP. Their systems are reliable, and they also offer servers, so your minimum reqs shouldn't be too much of a problem.
