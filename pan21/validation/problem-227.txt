Having said that, a load of 1.3 doesn't sound high, especially if you have a multi-core CPU configuration. If the load number is the same as the number of cores, then all the cores always have a process ready to run.
We deployed our new Linux/Exim/Spamassassin mail server on Friday (always a good idea to deploy the day before a long weekend when no admins are around). The load has been hovering around 1.3 on the 15-minute average.
Check your mail queue lengths periodically and the logs for undeliverable issues and problems of that nature. If the delivery queue stays relatively low that's fine.
The load doesn't seem out of the norm.  If the mail server is responsive, and the mail is going through i'd say the only measurement of failure beyond memory consumption would be if the wrong emails are getting through (spam).
You can much around with getting disk averages and network I/O information but if you're not seeing delivery issues (I sent the message fifteen minutes ago and it hasn't arrived yet!) and you can work on the system via console (or ssh) without a lot of latency, you should be fine.
Ultimately, if, as you say, the messages are being delivered in a timely fashion then the performance is fine :-)
Mind you today would be your first real test.  I'd probably monitor it lightly today.  If something is going to go wrong, now would be the time.
Basic rule of thumb: if the system is responsive, if it's working in a timely fashion, then you're fine.
Loads below two aren't much of a worry. I've had systems hit four or five and still work fine, although that would be an indicator that there's a lot of queuing issues with the network or drives (I/O issues can cause high loads even though the system is very responsive).
The machine is responsive, and mails are delivered in reasonable time. Can we assume that this is acceptable?
