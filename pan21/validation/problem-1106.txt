The interesting part is that I have another CD (in CDFS format) which I burnt a couple of months ago with some video files on it. I tried adding a track to the CD whith the CD being in CDFS format and the CD player played the track without any problems. So that CD is in CDFS format and it has some video files on it and an MP3 file and I can still add other music.
My question is: is there any way I can burn a CD in CDFS format and still be able to add tracks to it later on? I believe this is called "not closing the session on the CD" or something like that.
That's pretty much the behaviour I want from my CD (actually I only want audio files but I want to be able to add new songs later on without having to re-burn  the entire CD). However so far I've been unable to replicate that scenario with another CD.
I want to burn a cd in CDFS format from a Windows 7 computer. I might be wrong but as far as I could tell using the standard burn wizard in Win7 you can burn either in UDF or in CDFS format. I intend to use the CD in a car CD player which as far as I can tell only plays CDFS (I've tried both UDF and CDFS and it only played the CDFS).
