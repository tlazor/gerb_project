I would probably alter the solution a bit by having the chrome function point to a time stamped directory in /tmp/. That way a new instance could be created each time by typing in only chrome rather than chrome /tmp/junk/.
This one: http://techparade.blogspot.com/2011/03/multiple-user-profiles-in-google-chrome.html allows you to set up a full-fledged Application for multiple instances of chrome.
I've also been using http://watir.com/ which launches new Chrome instances. Would be nice to look into watir's source to see how they do it.

I often need multiple browsing sessions for logging into multiple services with different accounts at one time. I don't want to have to use multiple browsers, nor do I want to use a different release of Google Chrome. I would be open to running multiple instances of Google Chrome. However, I've tried using open -na Google\ Chrome and it won't open a second instance. Is there a way to do this on a Mac with Google Chrome?
