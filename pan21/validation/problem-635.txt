Each of the aforementioned articles and how-tos say it's ok to establish a default (non-secure) connection to an server via port 80 within an internal network from the NGinx server. But if the connection between the user and NGinx is meant to be secure, doesn't this non-ssl approach from NGinx to another server expose a weakness in the connection? For example, I use linode VPS and they have several data centers where I can spin up a VPS. So if I have my nginx server acting as a load balancer in Dallas (central to US), then have edge node VPS in CA and NY, wouldn't the connection from NGinx to either of these VPS be susceptible to packet sniffing, as it is not encrypted? 
It seems to me, the ideal setup would be to establish another ssl connection from the NGinx server to whichever edge node vps server will handle the request, thereby ensuring a truly secure connection from browser to edge node.
There are several questions and how-tos, on how to setup NGinx to work with Apache in handling SSL requests, but after reading several of them, I noticed a pattern, which raised the following question, one I would like a concrete answer to, whilst still in the design phase.
