You can directly import the CSV with the Data connection feature, but it is going to want to pull the data in and add it to a Worksheet.  This will work, so long as you import it to a secondary Worksheet and leave your formulas and calculations on another sheet.  When you click Refresh using this method, it's going to ask for the file name, and then re-import it using the same settings as originally used.  This method is also usually slower, or unusable, with large datasets.
A simpler way (thanks to this post) is to just import the data as you would for a text file you have already downloaded (ie Data > Import Text File) , but instead of entering a file name, paste the URL of the CSV file instead.
import the csv file directly via File->From Text check the connection properties in Data->Connections
My way would be to cut out the .csv file and use a Macro containing VBA and ADO that receives the data and puts it directly into a worksheet in Excel. Any ODBC compliant database can be your source. 
Excel 2010 has Data>>Get External Data - from various data sources. However, I prefer to write my own code because I have absolute control and can format the results in the macro.
PS Look at the list of drivers in Data>>Get External Data>> Existing Connections>> Browse for More >> New Source >> Other Advanced >> Next which leads you to the Data Link Properties list. You then have to know what source database and what driver to use. You can email me at cliffbeacham at hotmail with more details.
Easiest way of doing it is to import the Data into Access or SQL Express, and then use the Data Connection features and functions in Excel.  After the initial setup, all you would have to do is click Refresh All and it will pull the the data and recalculate the values.
