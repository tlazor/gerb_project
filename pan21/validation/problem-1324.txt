A word of caution - hosts are LOUD! a "quiet" host's fan sounds like the engine on an F16, versus a 747. A soundproof rack is important if you plan to put this in a classroom, or any closer than the next county.
With that setup, you could carve out personal or project virtual machines, and the students could get up close and personal with the cloud.
I'm going to start with a bit of definition, since industry terminology is somewhat in flux. "Server" means "an instance of an operating system and its contents". "Host" means "the hardware on which servers run".
However, Ubuntu server comes with the OpenStack MAAS components as one of the primary models of installation. (https://docs.ubuntu.com/maas/2.2/en/) .  
With three hosts, you can set up a cloud just like the big players do.  OpenStack was open sourced by Citrix, from a subset of the same code base that major hosting providers use. Being able to get hand-on with the metal of a real virtual cloud system using the same lineage of tooling as AWS, 1 and 1, or BlueMix would be a win/win.
You can pick up decent retired hosts for under $600 on Ebay (2 x 8 core i7, 96GBRAM, 6TB HDD, 2 GPU's)  Fire one up with Ubuntu server and LAMP stack.  This is comparable to what you would get if you bought bare metal on a low end cloud system.
