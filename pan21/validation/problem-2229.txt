So far I tried to create a new material and applied it to a cube object but the result is that the image gets stretched and sucks.
What I want to achieve is the most flexible, simple and performant way to create "shapes" with repeated background.
And here's what it looks like in effect (unfortunately I can't upload anything bigger because it goes over the 2MB limit):
For example, let's imagine that I have a png of a brick and that I want to use it to create a wall, that can be of a variable width and height. How can I achieve that? With html/css I would simply create a class like this:
Secondly, while applying the texture to the background object, you can add the tiling values so that the sprite is repeated instead of being stretched. This can be done using something like this.
I saw some example that creates N sprites programmatically by adding them one after another, but I wonder about the performance implications of this technique... for example if I have to repeat the brick 100 times I have to create 100 objects, it seems unfeasible to me!
and by applying that class to any html element it will render a repeated background by adapting it to its container no matter how large or tall is it. In unity/C# what should I do?
I'm a web developer with over 12 years of experience and I'm moving my first steps in game development in the latest days. Specifically I'm playing with Unity and trying to understand how it works and how can I realize a 2d platform game. Currently I created a character that can be controlled with the keyboard (it moves to right, left and can jump), so far it seems more easy than I was expecting and despite I never used C# before I'm already quite comfortable. My first big concerning is about sprites and how can I create combined sprites or use an image as a repeated background.
