Most home WiFi routers allow you to configure a "guest network". This wireless LAN is allowed to connect to the Internet, but isn't allowed to connect to devices on the main wired or wireless LANs. So you could put the IoT devices on network, and they won't be able to compromise your computers.
Yes, your solution is also ok but will increase one switching hop, plus config overhead, you can achieve this with one router by doing the following:
Create a separate network should be the best way to keep the insecure devices away from your secure LAN to prevent malicious users/devices from  gaining access to your shared files or networked devices ,it can be achieved by enabling the GUEST network Using the Netgar WNDR3700v3 features  with a strong and differents passwords .
Assuming your connection from router 1 to the Switch is using the WAN port of the router and you are not sharing WAN and LAN in OpenWRT (meaning you did not change the default settings and did the cabling as you would when connected directly to the modem), you are mostly fine.
If you want to have more complexity, you can also enable VLANs, this way you can put additional VLAN-aware devices behind the router and connect both types of devices to them, essentially making your whole home as if every device was plugged in directly into a port of one of both routers, even if you have only a single router and 5 switches behind it daisy-chained... but do this only if you must, as the possibility for error is substantial and the benefit depends on your cabling (almost none when using star topology, great when having to use ring topology).
Of course your devices on router 2 could send traffic to anybody, which can be a problem in itself (usage statistics, camera images, sound over microphones, information about WLAN, GPS receivers etc. depending on devices).
You can configure your ports separately and route the bad traffic separately from the good traffic. Your keyword would be DMZ, there are plenty of tutorials available.
