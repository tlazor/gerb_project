A switch is smart enough that it will build a MAC address table and maintain it as a frame enters the switch. The switch will look at the source MAC address on the frame, and it will build an entry for that MAC address that tells the switch on which interface the MAC address is connected. It only takes a single frame entering the switch on an interface to add an entry in the MAC address table for the source MAC address, and switches rapidly learn which MAC addresses are connected to which interfaces.
An ethernet switch is just that, as switch. Frames entering the switch on any of the interfaces could be sent to any other interface (switched), and that is controlled by the addressing on the frames. Each ethernet frame is switched independently, based on the addressing on the frame.
The switch will then look at the destination MAC address and try to find it in its MAC address table to switch the frame to the correct interface for the destination MAC address. If it does not find an entry in the table, it will flood the frame to all other interfaces.
TDM is a circuit-switched network, where the circuit (path) is set up at the beginning, and it is up until it is torn down. It does not vary, and no other devices can use that circuit until it is freed. Traffic put in one end of the circuit comes out at the other end of the circuit. TDM frames are always put in one end of the circuit and sent to the other end of the circuit, following the same path.
