The reason this is possible, is that the i7-5500u is from the low power 15 Watts range of intel, whereas the i7-2670QM has a TDP of 45 Watts. Judging from the benchmark results of notebookcheck.net (a good source for laptop cpu benchmarks), this i7-2670QM is about 20-30% faster when using it for very intense computational tasks. However, for the intended use you state, it shouldn't make any difference which one you use. The CPU will never be pushed to the max, and either CPU will feel just as fast. Therefore, provided you are happy with your current battery life, and have no other reasons to upgrade your laptop, I would just keep your old one. If the old one is getting slow, replacing HDD with an SSD and reinstalling windows on that will do much more for you than the CPU upgrade.
Please use ark.intel.com for Intel CPU comparisons. You get there when googling for the CPU, usually it's the first hit.
First, understand that operating frequency isn't such a meaningful metric for comparing chips anymore, and hasn't been for more than a decade. Chips hit 3-4GHz in 2002 or so, but haven't gone up since, due to the infamous Power Wall. From there, chips improved by adding additional cores, lowering power, moving more an more previously external components into the chipset, optimizing threading models, implementing parallel pipelining, etc. Nowadays, it is often hard to look at the standard specs and tell the differance.
@Frank's answer about not being able to know for sure reminded me (I'm getting old) that there are CPU benchmarks out there designed precisely for that purpose, and it seems my old CPU performs better:
The i7-5500u indeed has significantly better graphics. The single core performance is slightly better than that of the i7-2670QM, but performance when all cores are running to the max is higher for the i7-2670QM. 
In every TDP segment you can compare how powerful CPU's are one to another, but not across different TDP segments.
This is what makes the U processors so impressive, you'll want the fastest 6.Gen 15W CPU for a 24/7 home server, but you know that a 45W CPU would be a lot faster.
The main difference is that one is a M, while the other a U processor. Mobile (Laptop) vs Ultra-Low-Power (Netbook)
Keeping this in mind, go and compare benchmarks, knowing that you are comparing two different segments.
Second, note that Intel always has a number of differentiated product lines, so that they can fit into a set of pre-selected price points, and always have a new model at each point, so it will always be possible to find modern chips that appear to have lower metrics than chips from previous years. This is especially true if you are crossing product lines.
