As your DMZ device is also a router providing NAT and DHCP I would recommend you disable the DHCP server capabilities of your Tecnicolor router as this will cause problems. I would also recommend turning off the LAN and WiFi capabilities of the Tecnicolor as accidentally connecting to these will only give you Internet and no ability to connect to the other LAN.
The Tecnicolor modem/routers allow you to give one device (by its MAC address) on your internal LAN the "public" IP. This, essentially, puts that device in the DMZ but, at the same time, the device is contactable through your public IP - basically turning the Tecnicolor into just a modem.
Apart from managing the Tecnicolor modem through its GUI you'll never need to use its addresses as your other router is doing all the work.
I can't comment yet so will put this as an answer. Try first pinging a host name with a . on the end. Eg if ping www.google.com takes 30s to resolve then try ping www.google.com. and see if you get a response right away. If you do you have a DNS suffix issue. You should be able to adjust this in the DHCP settings.
