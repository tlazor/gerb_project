I'm sorry that this is all a bit vague, but there may offer some hints for people who run into a similar problem.
Perhaps there are a limited number of network threads to connect the virtuals to the host, and uploading large files takes up all of them eventually and the rest of them lose signal. I've got no other guesses. Sorry.
We eventually did find the problem.  It turned out to be a caused by a problem in our virtual network configuration.  For some reason that I can no longer remember exactly, network traffic for that particular download was taking an extra loop through the virtual networks.  When a user tried to upload a large file, the download was tying down all available kernel network buffers.  That was causing the entire network to freeze ... until something timed out and it all unjammed.
You might take a look at memory overcommitment and/or swap configuration(s). If the either is "tuned to the hilt" then a large file upload may be the trigger to the management of those resources - leading to the unavailability until the management is completed.
