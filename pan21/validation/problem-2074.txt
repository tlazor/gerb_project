This is my first foray into using EC2, and I created my first instance using an Amazon AMI running Ubuntu 12.04. I created a keypair and downloaded the .pem file to my local machine.  I was able to connect via SSH via the ubuntu user just fine.  I then created another user using the useradd command, and after a few tries, it was finally created.  However, somehow in the process of creating that user, the default ubuntu user was deleted.  I logged out of the instance, and now when I try to log in as my new user account, I get "Permission denied (access key)."  I didn't have my public key created in my .ssh directory for my new user on the server, but even so, shouldn't I still be able to use SSH with my password? That's what has worked for me on other servers. 
If I can't get in, it seems my only other option is to delete the instance and create another one.  Is there a way to access the one I have?
I've tried importing another key pair in the management console, but that hasn't helped. In terms of access groups, I just have the default group that grants access on port 22.
