Read up on the ephemeral port range on your operating system - it varies, but 49152 to 65535 is standard. Open 8080 and that port range. If it works, leave them open, it's generally safe. The main thing is to ensure privileged ports (below 1000) are protected.
This sounds like a problem with ephemeral ports. It working when you open all ports is the main reason I think this.
Short version: when a computer connects to a port on another computer, it chooses a random port as the "source" port. This port has to be unblocked on the destination computer to allow traffic to return to it.
I am unable to connect from one machine to the other on port 8080, if I change the source to allow all, then I am able to connect.
Assuming Server A is trying to ping Server B and Server B's security group grants inbound access from Server A's security group...
Have I missed a step? It doesn't matter which group ID I use as the source, I still can't access without leaving it wide open. Is there perhaps another port that needs to be opened to service HTTP requests? The connection isn't refused, it just times out.
I created a security group, added port 8080 as the port, and added the ID of the security group as the source. I then added this security group to both of the servers. 
I'm trying to enable port 8080 between a pair of servers running in different availability zones (but the same region) on AWS. 
If you select an instance from the Instances page on the EC2 Dashboard you can see the instance's public and private addresses.
You need to make sure Server A is pinging Server B via Server B's Private DNS Address (or Private IP Address) instead of Server B's public (or elastic) address.
It's probably not applicable in this case, but when you have connectivity problems you should generally check Network ACLs.
