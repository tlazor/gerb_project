the network admins handle the certificates themselves I guess) but some sites do not work without SSL, such as bank login pages. So I think the better idea would be to add the certificate to Firefox list of trusted authorities. To do this, I need to have an authority certificate. I tried to get it with the following Openssl command but to no avail:
If you're using corporate network or you trust the issuer, you've to import given certificate into your keychain and make it trusted for your SSL connection. To make it work for all web addresses, it needs to be Root certificate authority.
I am facing the same problem today, and every time I try to connect a site, all mozilla products ask for permission to add certificate. And that certificate only certifies for the specified website.
So how can I grab this local authority certificate that I could import to Firefox and stop being annoyed by the error messages?
In Chrome you can basically click on padlock icon, then Connection tab, so you can see the Certificate Information which should consist CRT link in your Root (top one) certificate.
It shows one certificate but and then it stops because some certificates could not be verified and the certificate is incorrect because Firefox display an error when I try to import it. I don't remember the exact message now but it was something like "this certificate is not valid authority certificate".
I also tried to use Wireshark but can't use too good and I failed to grab what I was looking for. And as the last resort, it's impossible to disable SSL certificates validation in Firefox.
If you can't get the certificate of the corporate web proxy, add your own local proxy (e.g., Burp Suite proxy) between the browser and corporate proxy, and install the local proxy's certificate in your browser.  Configure your browser to use the local proxy (Options -> Advanced -> Network -> Connection Settings).  The browser then only sees certificates issued by your local proxy, which is trusted, and you see no errors in the browser.
And a list appears there. Find your corporate certificate, and export it to a file, with wizard's default options.
In order to add your corporate certificate into the trusted authorities, go to Control Panel -> Internet Options -> Content -> Certificates -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities
My situation is the following: in our corporate network a special kind of SSL certificate issued by the company itself is used. Every time I open a site via https in Firefox a warning monit is displayed saying "sec_error_unknown_issuer". In certificate details it says that this particular certificate was issued by my company, there is a company address and name and everything. It's very annoying because I need to add an exception for the invalid certificate every single time I go to an SSL encrypted site. One possible solution would be to give up SSL and use plain http when possible (there is no difference between SSL and no-SSL at the moment if
On OS X you can double-click on the file or drag and drop in your Keychain Access, so it'll appear in login/Certificates. Then double-click on the imported certificated and make it Always Trust for SSL (as shown below).
