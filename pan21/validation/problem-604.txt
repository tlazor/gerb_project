I have a file named "php.ini" that's in the root web folder of my host. I need this folder to also be in every single folder and subfolder on the server. The host suggested "creating a symbolic link in the subfolders" and that was the extent of their help. I asked how and they told me to google it. So I did.. and I'm lost. So far I have this:
I've read a lot of the other posts here, and they all seem to be answered successfully, but I just can't follow along. I'm still very new, and I don't want to try the trial and error approach, because I'm not sure if I'll be able to fix it. Here's where I am.
But I'm not actually sure if this is right, and I'm not sure what the LINK-NAME is supposed to be, or what it does. Also, I don't know if this will create the link in every folder and subfolder? Since I'm supposed to use SSH to enter this command, I want to make sure I have it right before I try. I'm sorry if this is very basic knowledge (noob) question, all my searches just give an example and none of them explain what they do!
