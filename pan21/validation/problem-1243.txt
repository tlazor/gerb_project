If you don't have a good reason (based on a technical argument that you understand at least superficially), go with the default.
Ext2 is old, but supported everywhere. For desktop/home server usage, ext3 and ext4 are almost completely equal, both are following the same principles and philosophy. The main difference is the level of maturity: ext4 isn't mature enough, so gigantic production systems don't use it yet (rare instabilities or performance issues might 'ruin' those systems [at least financially :)], but not yours). XFS does have a great performance when a lot of small files are moving (but don't use it in your boot partition - AFAIK it is still not supported officially by GRUB, although, I use it with Debian stable, and it works); JFS and ReiserFS aren't native old-school Linux filesystems, but their integration is more than enough. Btrfs is an emerging brilliant thought, always use it with working backup! From btrfs most distros can't boot now, but the support grows from kernel to kernel. Zfs is not yet for home usage, desktops never could use its functionality by its extreme limits (it is constructed for unreachable limits).
I am new to Linux, coming from Windows background. What Filesystem should I use? I read that Ext3 is default still? Ext4 is unstable at times? true?
Usable at home, frequently with issues: btrfs, and yeah, ye olde ntfs and fat (one should never ever use those two on Linux, but who knows?)
Ubuntu's default filesystem is ext4, since 9.10. Ext4 is an evolution of ext3, which was the default filesystem before. Ext4 is often noticeably faster than Ext3 even for ordinary desktop use.
I've used btrfs on Ubuntu 10.10 and it was incredible slow (first thought my computer would be the problem). After reinstalling with ext4, it was much faster.
