There exists a portable version of chrome: http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/google_chrome_portable. It is usually meant to be used on a portable drive (e.g. usb drive), but I think this would suit your purpose.
Then again I have to ask why you need to do this; perhaps using the private browsing modes in the installed browsers is good enough.
Use the Tor Browser Bundle and copy it into your truecrypt partition. There is no installation, and using tor means your traffic is encrypted, so people can't easily figure out what you're visiting via snooping network traffic.
I have a TrueCrypt partition on my Windows 7 Pro 64-bit computer. I have Firefox and Chrome installed on my OS as normal, but I would like to have a completely private browser installed on my TrueCrypt partition--another copy of one of the two (preferably Chrome, but either is fine) installed completely independently on the partition. I don't want anyone to know that the separate installation even exists unless they can somehow get access to the encrypted partition.
