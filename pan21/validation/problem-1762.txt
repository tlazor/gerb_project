Once you've run that, depending how badly the image is damaged, you might be able to pull files of from a liveCD (Knoppix, for example); or you might have to use a specialist tool. The data recovery guy I work with swears by GetDataBack (NTFS version, in your case), it's not free, but if it can pull of your data, it's a worthwhile investment, as this may happen again sometime..
There are other data recovery tools but I haven't had to use any so I can't recommend one. A Google search for "data recovery software" shows that there are a lot of products out there.
If no other changes have been made to the disk (beyond marking the bad sectors) you might be able to get the data back.
The first thing to do is to image your drive to a new one, so you're not working on the bad copy. GNU ddrescue is good for this, because it copes with bad sectors.
My guess would be that if files are (partially) in a bad sector, the recovering software will have a hard time retrieving the files in a perfect state. Meaning they will probably be corrupted.
SpinRite is probably the best tool I've used for doing this sort of thing. Regarding data recovery, the website has this to say:
All I could find so far to do anything about bad sectors would be a low level format, but that would also erase the data... Though perhaps it's more important that you fix the bad sector than retrieve the files on the disk.
