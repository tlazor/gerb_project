Finally, if you suspect a drive is bad because it shows errors when running --detail on an array, it is typically prudent to check its SMART status, in addition to the status of the rest of your drives to see if everything else is in good shape. The following command will print all details of your first disk, and should be run for every disk that makes your RAID array:
You can see the status of an array by interpreting its metadata and drive states, or by using some kind of monitoring to do that for you, such as daemonized mdadm or a simple Nagios system.
The error messages are also sent to the virtual console. On a headless server, it is possible to view them:
This will mail root when events occur, and will run in the background. This could be run at each startup, but is a very basic solution. It may be enough for you.
You can poll a RAID array for details via the mdadm tool manually. A general status of your array will be output when using # mdadm --detail /dev/md0. Alternatively, you may check the status of your arrays by viewing the output of the mdstat file: # cat /proc/mdstat.
The metadata information of individual disks that constitute an array can be see using the --examine flag like so:
