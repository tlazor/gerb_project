RIPE have a very useful page listing CPE support for IPv6.  This is for CPE available within the RIPE region, ie in Europe.
I was wondering what CPE (customer-premises equipment) had proper IPv6 support.  I'm in the process of getting an AS and some IPv4 addressing (yes, I'm depleting IPv4.  Sorry, folks) and I was intending to future-proof a bit by getting a /48 and getting IPv6 working properly.
If I were to set it up at our end, what CPE could I recommend to my users so they could use IPv6 end-to-end.  Ideally, I'd be looking at a router with 802.11n support, that does DHCPv6 and/or NDP/SLAAC and also has a firewall with the default configuration being allow from the secured network to the insecure network and deny in the opposite direction (ie the equivalent of the usual IPv4 configuration, but with the NAT taken out).  Also, it should probably also be able to terminate a 6to4 tunnel to SixXS or Hurricane Electric and be easy for a relative novice to set up.
I hear that the Apple AirPort Extreme is a good IPv6 option.  Is that correct?  What other manufacturers have something available now?
These not only list what devices support IPv6, but have a matrix of precisely what IPv6 features they support.
