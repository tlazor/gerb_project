I would look into a generic SSH daemon for Windows.  OpenSSH (free, but difficult to configure and you may be stuck in a POSIX environment) or Bitvise's WinSSHD (easy to set up but not free) are two possibilities.  WinRM is the Microsoft solution to this problem, however.
Another alternative is to use Sysinternal's PSExec.  I have in the past written batch files which copy a second batch file using Administrative shares (\\C$) to the remote system, and then PSExec will launch that second batch file.  That works well on clients, but I'd be hesitant about doing it on servers.
For me, lacking company support for those fancy alternatives, I start a VPN session and use the directions found in the eBook: Laymanâ€™s Guide to PowerShell 2.0 Remoting.
I write "basically because there are some (a handfull, but not difficult) security configurations to make, but these depend on the environment (domain, trust...)
You could always be a Bad Admin(TM) and enable the Telnet Server on older Windows clients, and then disable it again once you're finished!
Basically, to enable Powershell remoting on machine "pc1" with ip "10.11.12.13" start powershell (Version 2.0 and newer) as admin on "pc1" and type
Sounds like you are after something like /n Software's Powershell SSH Server or Quest's PowerGui Pro Mobile Shell.
before I got into it I used http://www.freesshd.com/ which is a very simple to setup windows ssh service (to connect to with putty)
