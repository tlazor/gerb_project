On Windows, there's no "official" packaging of PHP, MySQL et al. as there's on Linux distros, so there's choices to be made, basically using the software from the original source or use a distribution such as XAMPP.
If you use Linux, things are much simpler. Choose a distro and use the distro's packages for PHP, Apache, MySQL, etc. They will work out of the box, receive security upgrades easily, etc.
Well, basically, you have two paths; use Windows or use Linux. I'm biased, but I'd really go and use Linux. Running Windows is most certainly going to be more expensive (Windows licenses have a cost), and, in my opinion, although PHP runs on Windows, it's more at home at Linux.
You have to balance effort (probably distributions require less work), timely updates (which are vital for Internet publicly facing services- probably original packages have advantages here) and quality (can't really tell).
If you want to use Windows, things are a bit more difficult. For starters, you might want to consider using IIS, which is Windows' official web server. I don't really know if IIS+PHP is really "better" than Apache+PHP on Windows, but I suspect so- and Apache's pretty UNIXy, so probably IIS "fits better".
