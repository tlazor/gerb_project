As Sathya said, it is probably a trick to get you to download a trojan/virus/other malware. However, there are certain ways to encrypt perfectly legitimate and normal videos with DRM licensing. This allows people to share the file all they want, but only those with a proper license are able to decrypt and view it.
It means the codec for this particular movie is not installed. Try opening it with VLC. That one opens almost every movie file without needing any codec (they're built-in).
That said, the OP was not clear on some things--Is this movie on a DVD? Is it a file? Was it downloaded? And so on. On the assumption it was a file downloaded from the Internet, I can see two likely cases:
Happens for most illegally acquired movies which require that you install a "decrypter" which is in reality a Trojan Horse.
If the video file consists of two folders, in which one of them is a Video TS folder, you can decrypt them using DVDFab. You can then convert the decrypted Video TS folder to a single file, such as an mp4, using handbrake.
My suggestion would be download MediaInfo (available on sourfeforge), and use it to determine what the exact contents of the video file are, whether it is licensed (licensed videos are often licensed with "vidlock" encryption, for example), or whether you truly need a different codec. You can also find (via Google) and download the K-Lite codec pack, which includes the majority of popular/common audio and video codecs, and has the advantage of being well-known and reasonably trusted to not be malware.
