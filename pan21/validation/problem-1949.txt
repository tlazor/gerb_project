These days the linux kernel has good auto-tuning of TCP, you can do better, however those are not the default because they're seen to be "greedy" and not fair on the Internet.
One thing you may want to look at web100.  It is a kernel patch, and a userland too designed to optimized the Linux kernel for high-performance networks.
I figure it's a good idea to have a central question for linux network tuning. I'm particularly interested in tuning options for the following.
and you really want [ maybe you don't know about it yet ;-] gather statistics - eg with munin - to do some capacity planning and see if your tuning indeed decreases system load.
At this point it's generally not worth the overhead of "tuning" within the kernel. Unless you have the test gear (or a cluster to A/B options on) and very good documentation it's not worth it for the sys-admin overhead alone.
for file/sql/poroxy server you definitivly want to mount partition with data/spool with noatime,nodiratime and for reiserfs - notail ] to avoid additional disk trashing whenever file is accessed for read.
