userPrincipalName attribute can be set to any values using ADSIedit.  However, to make the userPrincipalName useful, you have to set it to some defined format.  It should always look like this username@domain.name.  Also, you cannot set arbitrary domain.name.  Otherwise, Windows cannot look up correct domain controller to do the authentication.
The value of userPrincipalName of an AD user can be edited in Active Directory User and Computer.  The value is shown under User logon name under the Account tab.  From this property page,  you immediately find that you can only edit the username part of the UPN.  Windows give you a combo box for the domain.name part.  Normally, there is only one option there, which is your AD domain name.
In order to use some other values for domain.name, you need to add additional domain suffixes by using Active Directory Domains and Trusts.  See here.  Note that only domain administrator can add additional domain suffixes for the domain.  Once you add the additional domain suffixes, you can go back to Active Directory User and Computer.  The user property page should now allow you to choose the newly added domain suffixes along with the default AD domain name.
