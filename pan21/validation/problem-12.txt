The is a comprehensive guide on downloading in proprietary format (arf), and then converting to wmv on the Webex website, both for owners (host through managing interface) and viewers (non-host through URL link)
You'd have to go to the Temp folder, arrange the items by modification date, and look for the ones created when you visit the Webinar site and start playing. If you're lucky, you'll find several files, including the biggest one, which is probably a video.
Instead of downloading a WebEx, what you can do is use the WebEx player to stream the video to your PC and then record it using the latest version of SnagIt.  Then you can save the file as an MP4 to your hard disk.
It'll probably not have the right extension, but a rename might do, or, depending on the contents, directly trying to open it with VLC. You'd have to inspect the file for any hints towards which video codec and container is used, and then try the appropriate extension (e.g. mp4 or avi).
