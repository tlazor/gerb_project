Now, I know this method is mouse as opposed to keyboard, but it does replicate the same functionality somewhat (from what I can tell from your updated q, never used Mac myself), just a different means of getting to it. If you're not wedded to the idea of strict KB experience, it may help... 
I found a solution!  Follow the instructions here: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16334/make-the-taskbar-buttons-switch-to-the-last-active-window-in-windows-7/
It will make it so clicking on the taskbar button in Win7 switch to the last active window of that app (switching applications) and clicking it repeatedly will cycle through the windows of that application in usage order.
And, then if you press windows + # of what place the program is in the task bar, it will switch to the last window of that program.  This works best for windows you've pinned to the task bar and therefore know what # they are.  For example, windows + 3 switches between my two open chrome windows.
For applications which do not open multiple documents as multiple taskbar buttons as say IE does (for example, FF without the secret switch on) you would still need to use CTRL-TAB as you said, but any app which actually opens tiles on the tasbar, this will work.
I found a solution that works for me, based on another partial solution (unfortunately, I cannot recall where I found that so cannot give due credit).
Ohh... I was missing my Mac's ALT+` so much... But I have just found the Windows 7 equivalent: CTRL+F6
