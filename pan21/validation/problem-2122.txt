Down the road, you have room to grow as well. You can leverage a service like rsync.net, Amazon S3, Asigra or some other solution to get off-site backup capability in the cloud -- but you don't need to do that on Day 1.
Chopper3's suggestion of using Time Machine is solid. It's a pretty cool Mac thing that Mac people will probably like.
Any reason why you wouldn't consider 3rd party backup solutions like Crashplan, Jungle Disk, or Mozy?
As others have mentioned, you need to have a Recovery Plan, not just a backup plan. You need to verify periodically that you can restore a system from your current backups. You need to know how long it will take.
The other nice thing is that you have the full Apple stack, and can go to Apple for support. You'll also get some side benefits, like the Apple Wiki/Blog system that is pretty cool, local iChat server, and the ability to do Spotlight searches across multiple computers.
It can backup to individual hard disks such as those little portable USB ones you can get for <Â£$100 each OR you can get a big centralised disk think from Apple called a Time Capsule (Clicky for link), you put this on your network and set everyone's Mac's to backup to it - it's really simple and works a treat.
Cost is not so bad. You're looking at $2,000 for a minimally configured Drobo with lots of upgrade capacilty and $1,000 for the Mac Mini Server.
I'd extend the Apple Time Machine recommendation a couple of steps further. It sounds like you have a small group of people with reasonable computer skills, but don't have and probably cannot afford to spend alot of time on "IT" chores.
I generally prefer file synchronization to normal backups for user files, because even when I was at the office without my laptop, I could still look at my files, for example, from someone else's machine or from a "burnbox" computer. Very convenient. Look at rsync
If you're using OSX version 10.5 or 10.6 you have a great automated backup system already there called Time Machine.
I'd consider buying a Mac Mini Server and a Drobo Pro storage system. You attach the Drobo to the Mac Mini Server and use it as a time machine target for your clients. The beauty of the Drobo versus something like FreeNAS is that it is EASY -- as your storage needs go, you just plug in drives and it automatically handles everything. If a drive fails, you're safe and get a red light.
