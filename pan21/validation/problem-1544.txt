The PC Speaker interface can only control one speaker - see osdev.org for sample code.  So there's no native way to do what you want.
So here's my question: given that the MoBo in question has it's PC-Speaker directly soldered on rather than via a wired connection, would it be possible (assuming that there was a four pin connecter available on the MoBo) to install a second PC-Speaker? More importantly if this could be done, would it be possible to use both PC-Speakers at once within games, and other software, to either allow for a higher number of mixed sound FX at once, or to use one to provide basic sound FX and the other to play low-quality MIDI sample based music in place of regular in-game tracks?
P.S.: Please do not suggest DOSBox, DOSEMU or any other DOS Emulator, I have no desire to use these things. Thanks!
TL;DR: could one hypothetically use two internal PC-Speakers as a low-quality replacement for a stereo-capable soundcard when playing games in DOS?
Now a bit of information about the current set up, and my goal: after many years of using DOSBox I grew tired of it and decided I wanted to go back to genuine DOS. So I dug through my collection of spare and old hardware and frankensteined together a retro tower. The tower in question is using a 3.0GHz Pentium D CPU, with 512MB RAM and an on-board GPU with VGA support up to 1440x900 and 64MB of VRAM. External drive is a USB1.1 floppy diskette drive (3.5").
Now I installed a copy of FreeDOS on this machine rather than MS-DOS or PC-DOS because of the Extended Memory Support, however once I had finished configuring everything I realized I had neglected one very important piece of hardware: a soundcard. Seeing as I don't have money to buy one at the moment and I don't have one laying around I am stuck using the PC-Speaker for sound effects in games and with no music.
First a bit of context: by 'PC-Speakers' I do not mean standard 3.5mm jack based stereo speakers. What I am reffering to is the 4-pin 255 frequency speaker connected directly to the motherboard.
