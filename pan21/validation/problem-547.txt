examples of what to monitor: running out of space, service shut down, errors in event log, unsuccessful (and successful) log-in attempts, etc.
It has a monitoring agent for windows, but because you host on vps, you will probably need some sort of VPN tunnel to access it.
If you're using Win2k8 you can use perfmon to monitor and launch a batch file or powershell script to send you an email using alerts.
any suggestions? preferably free or cheap solution. I host on vps, it wouldn't make sense for monitoring to cost as much as 1-2 years of hosting.
If you're planning on monitoring more than one server, or want graphing you'll probably want to look at implementing Nagios. If you go the Nagios route I recommend implementing a frontend such as Centreon.
I definitely recommend Zabbix too. It's user friendlier then other similar solutions(cacti, nagios) And the built in capabilities are great - graphs, notifications, dashboards.
You could setup SNMP and then run Nagios to do the actual monitoring on the server itself. You won't get graph data out of Nagios without a little bit of hacking though, and it's not the greatest. For graphing you could look into Cacti or MRTG. I personally use Cacti and Nagios for monitoring.
