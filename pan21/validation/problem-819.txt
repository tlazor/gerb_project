Its not a technical problem with either tool per-se, but if your users number in the dozens or greater its going to be a noticable uptick in support workload and frustrated users.
Every time I've ever implemented denyhosts or fail2ban in a production environment it has created a guaranteed ticket-stream of unlock requests, password reset requests, requests to change the settings or manage the whitelist, and generally just people who give up logging in to look into things and lean more on the sysadmins for stuff they could do themselves.
Also, the problem they solve is they reduce your risk of brute force ssh login attacks.  Honestly, the risk of that is incredibly small as long as you have even a moderately decent password policy.
No root logon, plus pretty long and random passwords and fail2ban and maybe different port is for most of us enough secure.
I've run Fail2Ban for a little while now, and just recently I've seen distributed attempts to break in to my SSH server. They'll never succeed at the rate their going, but I've been keeping an eye on it.
They've been going through a dictionary, each IP tries twice, after those attempts fail another IP does the same, etc. I've considered banning IPs that try unknown usernames x times. But so far I've gotten a few thousand different IPs trying to get in; and I'm concerned that even if I block them all there'll still be more.
