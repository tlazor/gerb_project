Every other servers inside that cluster would seamlessly connect to IP 1, and the Debian server hosting IP 1 would figure out either IP 2 or IP 3 should be the next hop.
I found many articles about Heartbeat daemon, but it seems like appropriate only when IP 2 & 3's hosts can have the daemon installed, which is not possible in my case.
IP 1 redirecting to IP 2, or if IP 2 is not reachable, redirecting to IP 3. IP 2 and IP 3 are hosted outside of the cluster & are out of my zone of control.
Install haproxy then you should create one front end pool on IP1 and configure IP2 and IP3 as servers behind it.  It sounds like you can use both at the same time, but it you want something more complicated you can have each of the serving IPs in their own pool and only fail out of the IP2 pool if it is down.  How does haproxy know the IP is down?  When a health check fails.  You will need to find some harmless URL to build into a health check so haproxy can proactively verify that the backend IP's are functional.
