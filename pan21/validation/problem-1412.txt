Moving the antenna from a poor place to a better one will help with both old system (assuming antenna or desktop could be moved), a new 2.4GHz card and a new 5GHz card.
Measurements are not normed, so have to be taken with a grain of salt, but in general a strength at about -70 dB is borderline for data transfer; you'll often get reduced speed at this strength. And the further degradation of the signal because of the other APs on this channel will make things worse.
And lastly, it is not all about 2.4 vs 5. A good .n card or a .ac card can help a lot because those cards can do nice tricks which improve reception. for .n this was optional (so some do. Most cheap ones do not). For .ac is is mandatory. 
Almost not answered since you seem to ask about wireless, but a wired cable usually beats any wireless connection. Often 100mbit wired beats 300mbit wireless. And a wired network cable is cheap. Even if only used to test that the network is the problem and not something else on the desktop.
Moving to a band which is not used by your neighbours will also help. The 5GHz band has lots more options here, but it is worth checking if there are unused bands/channels before you buy anything. InSSIDer worked well for me to test that.
As for 5 GHz, this will help with channel contention by other APs, but 5 GHz in general has a shorter range than 2.4 GHz, so it might actually be worse.
The first step is definitely to get a good antenna and a cable, so you can move it around. Strength and quality of a Wifi signal can vary a lot even if you just move it a few centimeters, because of interference patterns. This article has an image to give you an idea.
