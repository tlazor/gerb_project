1) Did you try to enable windows firewall on both outgoing AND incoming connections?  Maybe the SoftEther VPN opens it automagically? :)
I've managed to set up IPv4 just fine - DHCP assigns IP and everything seems to be normal. But when it comes to IPv6, seems like nothing is working. Seems like no requests are coming through at all. On the Microsoft box, it just remains silent, even manually setting up IPv6 in the PPP miniport doesn't help - nothing comes through. On Android though (using VPN Client Pro) I'm just receiving a message "IPv6 configuration rejected", and no requests are coming through too.
There is not enough information - do you have logs on the client and/or the server?  Just few things that come into my mind:
2) Did you try to use an IPv6 over IPv4 Tunnel? If yes, does it work for you?  If not, please try it out and tell us the result
PS: when trying to connect through the native SoftEther VPN client from the Windows box, IPv6 works too, I get assigned an address, and the traffic flows through it.
I'm using SoftEther VPN server (multiprotocol) for my VPN needs. Among others, it does include the SSTP endpoint.
