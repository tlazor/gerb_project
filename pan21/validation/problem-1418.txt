iptables permits you to do special processing per packet, by assigning the packet to the QUEUE chain; each packet must then be processed by a userland program that will decide the fate of the packet (Accept, drop, et-cetera).  Writing such a handler is described here: http://imchris.org/projects/libipq.html.  Because this technique involves making a routing decision per-packet in userland; it may have some serious throughput implications.  If possible, you really should consider using ErikA's suggestion of just writing a script that manages rules as needed.
IPtables/netfilter is your only option. What you'll need is some custom script that manages netfilter rules according to information in your database.
IPtables is great but I need something that will work with MySQL and grant control based on certain IF conditions.
I have a linux server that many users connect to. I use Squid for http access but I need a software that can grant access control to different ports based on a MySQL database.
