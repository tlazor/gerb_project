I need to schedule some queries to run at the beginning of every month (for monthly reports) and I read that creating a JOB in sql server 2008 was the way to go. Unfortunately, I don't have the rights/privileges to use SQL Server Agent at this time. Is there another way of scheduling a few queries to run the first day of every month?  
If you have to, you could create a 'hack' - one possible way is to find a stored proc that you know gets called at least daily and add a final step in there to check if DATEPART('dd', getdate()) = 1. If so, call your other proc that you'd like to be 'scheduled'.
If you absolutely cannot use SQL jobs to do it, you could use C# to write a program which connects to the database and runs the queries.  Then, compile this program into an executable and write a batch job which runs the executable from Windows Task Scheduler.
We use AutoSQL in our office. It requires no access to specific services, only a connection to SQL server and task scheduler. It's user friendly and outputs to Excel, CSV and email.
