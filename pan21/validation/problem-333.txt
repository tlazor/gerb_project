Most motherboards for desktop computers have the form factor ATX. A full-size ATX motherboard measures 12 × 9.6 in (305 × 244 mm).
The biggest problem can be the connectors on the back of the computer, these (naturally) come from the motherboard. To get rid of any problems of connectors not fitting through your computer case, almost all motherboards come with a metal insert to replace the one that came with your case. 
            Good news is that with newer hardware the motherboard size should not be to much of a problem, all name brand computer cases will have holes for each motherboard type. Just ensure if you are going with a full size mother board ( vs a mini board ) that the case is designed for full size ( which shouldnt be a problem )
Every motherboard and computer case you purchase should specify their form factors. If they match, there should be no problem. However, an oversize graphics card or CPU cooler can still be a tight fit. In my last build, I needed a set of pliers to bend things a little.
Several aspects of a motherboard (including its dimensions and location of mounting holes) are determined by its form factor.
Your tower should also come with the stand-off's and correct screws to use. Just make sure you put in your back plate before the motehrboard is my only other advice. No additional hardware would be required apart from a screwdriver =D
Motherboards and computer cases come in a Form Factor. There are a number of different form factors, a good overview is our friend Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer_form_factors
While it is possible to fit a smaller form factor into a larger case, this tends to depend on the available 'screw holes' in the computer case. Most cases can fit a couple (if not all) form factors.
