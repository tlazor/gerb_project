For SQL Server 2005 and above, the threshold for getting at the "plain text" is higher than before. Basically, sysadmin over DAC. At this point, you're already pwned anyway.
the answer is alwasy the same: what you ask for is called Digital Rights Management and SQL Server does not support DRM. This answer applies whether you refer to data, to schema design or to stored procedures logic. See Who needs encryption? for a more detailed discussion.
However encrypting your stored procedure does at least make it more difficult to see the source - I'm also not sure whether any of the current methods of decrypting stored procedures are actually viable on a live SQL server installation - last time I looked many methods required exclusive access to the SQL server instance, and prevented any other users from accessing the server (although this may not still be true).
So, it's safe enough for end users and developers (without sysadmin) but not if want to use it to protect IP at a client's site.
I want to protect my stored procedures T-SQL source code (i.e. not viewable by some other party) by using encrypt stored procedure function provided by SQL Server. I am not sure whether encrypt stored procedure is safe and whether the administrator of the machine (installed with SQL Server) will have ways to view stored procedure's source code?
I am using SQL Server 2008 Enterprise on Windows Server 2003 Enterprise. I developed some stored procedures for SQL Server and the machine installed with SQL Server may not be fully under my control (may be used by un-trusted 3rd party).
It is possible to decrypt and view the source of encrypted SQL stored procedures, a quick search for "Decrypt sql stored procedure" shows you a fair number of hits, for example:
Its also worth noting that encrypting your stored procedure can raise support headaches - because you are no longer able to see execution plans for your encrypted stored procedures you may have problems attempting to diagnose any performance issues.
