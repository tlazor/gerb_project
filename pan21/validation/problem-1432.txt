If it were me, even though RHEL provides a standardized way of handling static routes, I'd probably do everything in ifup-local and ifdown-local, just to keep all my interface specific bits together.
If you wanted to, you could include the ip route rules for each interface in ifup-local, too.  If you wanted to remove the corresponding rules when an interface is downed, you could create a similar /sbin/ifdown-local script to handle that.
Now, for the ip rule commands, the best place I can think of would probably be in /sbin/ifup-local.  If this file exists, it gets run after an interface is brought up.  One note with this one, if /sbin/ifup-local exists, it will get called as an executable and passed an argument of the interface name.  So you'll have to write handler code to check that argument against the interfaces you want to add configs for and then take the appropriate action.
For adding static routes in RHEL, you add them to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-INTERFACE where INTERFACE matches the name of the ifcfg-INTERFACE entries.  The statements in the route-* files will be passed to ip route add and ip route del when the interface is brought up or down.
