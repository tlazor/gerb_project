I have only moderate experience with PIX's, but to the best of my knowledge, the following is all the commands that control the VPN setup.
If you don't have an access-list applied to your outside interface, then go ahead an apply that to your outside interface as you have said above.
You might find yourself in a world of pain if you apply 'acl-out' to your outside interface! If there is already an access-group applied then there is a risk that you will remove all of your existing inbound access.
If you do have an access-list applied to your outside interface then you'll want to add to that one rather than creating a new one
There is also potentially a PPTP fixup command that may be needed, but it sounds like that is only needed for inside to outside PPTP.  Does this look correct or will I need anything more?
Before you do anything do a show access-group to check what acl's are already applied (if any). I don't have a PIX v6 to check exactly what the commands would but it'll be something like:-
I've looked at the PIX v6.3 command reference and I do not seen any information on disabling it.  The tftp-server commands reference using a no command to disable the tftp-server, but the vpnd command reference has no information on it.  To disable, is it as simple as using a no vpdn enable outside command or doing a no for all of the above commands, or is it something else?
Our plan is to just disable the VPN connection on the PIX and pass VPN through and let the DC manage it.  Problem is, I cannot find any information on disabling the existing VPN setup on the PIX.
The company I work for has a client that has a Cisco PIX 506e firewall running v6.3.  The PIX is currently set up to manage PPTP VPN connections using the local Windows domain controller as a RADIUS server.  The PIX does not support MSCHAP v2 connections, so users cannot connect from Windows 7 workstations.
Similarly, if you want to completely remove all of the vpdn config, just type 'no' in front of the configuration line you'd like to remove
