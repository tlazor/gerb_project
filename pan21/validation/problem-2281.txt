I tried most of these solutions, but the one that worked for me was setting the system compatibility mode on the files I found in the following location:
To force all java executables to have "properties > compatibility > dpi scaling mode" set to "System", in an administrator powershell (win-x, a), run:
Instead of HKCU you could use HKLM, but then you cannot change the dpi-scaling setting manually anymore in the properties > compatibility dialog of the java*.exe files.
Elderry's solution is good, but what if you want to run a jar file on Windows and it doesn't have compatibility options?
I found that -Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=false does not work in Java 9 or 10. Also for Java 8 and 9 my swing app is small, but Java 10 sizes properly in windows!
Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre\bin and find javaw.exe. Right click, properties, compatibility tab, check "override high DPI scaling behavior" and select "System" (Note that "System enhanced" did not work for me).
Now jar file windows should scale properly with readable text. If not, it might mean that Windows doesn't link jar type files to javaw.eve like it should. A third party fix is available at: https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html
