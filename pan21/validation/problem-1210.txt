I happened to see this article just now and saw that the article is quite old so assume that the owner of the post must have rebuilt his machine by now. Still I'd like to add an answer of my own for anyone else that comes across this. 
I think @ultrasawblade above was on to something when he spotted eubakup.sys and EUBKMON.SYS in the screenshot and correctly identified these as being non-standard" Windows drivers. When I see the screenshot above I can see how those drivers get loaded just a bit before Windows doesn't continue any further. 
To resolve this, one could try running Sysinternal's Autoruns tool in offline mode. I've used Autoruns though not in offline mode so will try my best to explain this. One would need to boot into the system with a Windows PE disk and then run Autoruns (File -> Analyze Offline) and then point it to the Windows folder. One can then hide any Microsoft entries to focus on and disable those drivers above. 
If I ever use backup software, I notice how the driver for the backup software gets referenced in the stack trace in each and every read and write operation. I would hazard a guess that in this person's situation that that would also be the case and that the driver would start looking at any drivers that get loaded thereafter. For some reason CLASSPNP would pass fine and for another reason the driver after that would be prevented from loading. That should allow the machine to boot up again.
