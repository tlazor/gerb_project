Get FC if you have money. A single iSCSI adapter is 4 times slower than a single FC HBA. You can get to the theoretical bandwidth of FC by adding gigabit ethernet adapters, but you won't get the low latency.
Putting the DBMS on physical hardware is always the safer bet. Don't virtualize unless your back is to the wall and your boss is bigger than you.
Have you considered putting your VM's (Virtual Machines) on SAN? For virtual machines the low latency of FC counts a lot since VM's generate many small I/O's. For a cheaper NAS option for VM's I prefer NFS over iSCSI. Configuration is easier while backing up a VM is just a folder copy.
Xen virtualization is extremely stable and well configured can give you really good performance (not a trivial task, to be sure!).  Almost the only applications that suffer significantly are high bandwidth ones, like fileservers or DBMS.  So, it's wise to put the DB on a real server if you expect heavy load.  Everything else would be limited by your internet bandwidth, so virtualizing them isn't a problem.
Generally fine, I'd 100% put your DBs on an FC SAN if you're anticipating high-load, we run JBoss on Oracle's rebadged RHEL 5U3 inside VMWare ESX 3.5U4, works very well, you could use VMWare's HA for failover if you wished?
Minus the FTP, that diagram looks very like one of our systems, which has been working fine for us.  As for some of your other points:
About the SAN: it's usually enough to use iSCSI for Xen storage if you have good switches (learn that the hard way! 3Com isn't so good, better go HP or Dell).  If the DB won't grow into the TeraByte range, I'd use internal storage (10K or 15Krpm SAS disks on RAID1 if you want) and not a SAN.  If the DB would grow beyond that, better invest in a good FC SAN (there i can't help you)
If your load balancers are exposed to untrusted networks I would consider firewalling the application servers and database servers in different zones. Your server roles are already nicely layered. Also, I would try to avoid direct access to my database servers for the FTP farm.
