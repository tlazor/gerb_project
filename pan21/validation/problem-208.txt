As others have mentioned, the outermost router can tell you who is traversing it to hit your web server (I'm not sure how this particular Linksys device works but it shouldn't be mucking with the source address of requests. If it is it's not doing "standard" NAT -- in any case it would have to maintain a mapping table, especially if it's playing proxy).
Such attempts are entirely normal unfortunately, it's just the net's background noise and there is no real way to stop it in a general way. You just have to make sure that the things you make available to the outside is secured. Tools like fail2ban can help to prevent broad attempts to attack a lot of different URLS (or SSH connection attempts etc.). 
As long as you resolve the mystery you're currently facing (and nothing else unusual shows up in the logs) the background noise can generally be ignored.
Don't expect this to cure the continuous blinking of your modem lights though --- that IS the normal background noise of the internet (there will always be traffic bouncing around on your modem, especially if you have a web server running and people poke at it).
