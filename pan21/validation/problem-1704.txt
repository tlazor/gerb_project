I saw this error when I opened a workbook that did have links to another workbook. I only see it when the workbook to which it is linked is not open. If I open the workbook with the source of the links, then open the one that was giving the error, the error msg did not popup.
When I open some spreadsheets I get the error "Security Warning Automatic update of links has been disabled". I can only imagine this might be in reference to formulas or other content in the workbook which link to other workbooks. However, most of the time, the sheets I'm opening when I get this message should not have any such links.
The only way I worked around the issue was to select all the data in the worksheet (I only had 1 worksheet) then paste it into a new Excel file.
I had the same issue, In my case the excel file had email addresses which automatically turned into links. I selected all of them, right clicked and chose remove links, but I still received the link warning on opening the file.
check to see nothing is pointing to a different sheet. If there is nothing there then click on formulas then click on name manager and see if there is any formulas referring to a different sheet. Once you fix those save and close and open the sheet and should be all good to go.
