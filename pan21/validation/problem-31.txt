Whenever you are storing passwords, it's best to ensure that they will be encrypted, and access to the encrypted password database is limited.  I wouldn't typically use a revision control system for this, as it has a fair bit of overhead and complexity which really serves only to increase your attack surface.
If you are writing passwords in configuration files, it's certainly easier to leave those passwords in when checking the configuration files into revision control.  Doing so certainly isn't any less secure than just having them in the configuration file to begin with, as long as appropriate access control is applied to the repository (both permissions on the repository, and filesystem permissions on what the repository uses for its backend).  Passwords stored like this are certainly vulnerable, but often you have no choice.
Lots of people store administrative passwords in spreadsheets and in documentation.  Don't be like those people unless you enjoy being embarrassed by pentesters.
The best solution is to use software which encrypts the passwords, storing them on an offline system if possible.  Lots and lots of software exists for this (and some of it can actively change the passwords for you as required and keep records of historical passwords).  Hitachi ID Systems makes an enterprise-grade product for this (disclosure: I used to work for them); keepass and lastpass also come to mind.
