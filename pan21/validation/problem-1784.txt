I have a check_nrpe wrapper that does this.  I create a host object with the 'name' objective set to something like 'RANDOM-001' (also supports 'RNDRBN-001').  When the check_nrpe wrapper sees this, it uses the trailing digits to pick from a Perl list of server hostnames to send the check to.  Then just add this as hostname to the Service Check description.  A more recent version of the wrapper grabs the hostnames from the Nagios hostgroups.cfg file.
I have a cluster of N nodes which contains some distributed information. The query i want to monitor with nagios make sense to execute only on one node of the cluster (any). But i don't want to overload one particular node, so i want nagios to select every time random node from the list of nodes.
That way you wouldn't have to change anything in Nagios when adding a new node, and it could just be part of your node setup.
Not to my knowledge, if you're running a custom plugin that you've written, it should be pretty trivial to add an option that randomly pulls from a number of passed hosts, and only test one of them.
A bit more of a description of the setup would be helpful, if we can't find anything, I'd be happy to help you come up with something even if it's custom.
You do mention there are N nodes, I don't suppose these all sit behind a VIP of some kind, that only points at one node, and moves to a different box as needed?
One other solution for this is to run the check on each node server and offsetting the times via a task scheduler/cron, then have the checks output the results to a central location. You can have the Nagios check look at the results in that file accordingly.
