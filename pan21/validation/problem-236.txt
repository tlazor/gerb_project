That is pretty much the way DHCP Servers work. It will always give you your last issued IP if it is available. Other than MAC spoofing you can turn your computer off, turn on some other device that needs an IP address so it will be issued "your old IP". Then turn your computer back on and it will issue you a new one. There was no mention of what you were trying to accomplish or why you needed a new IP but an alternative would be to static IP yourself and change when needed.
You then ask for an IP again ("Hey, I am AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF which last had IP 1.2.3.100. Can I please have an IP again?"). This time you want another IP, but the DHCP server is helpfully giving you 1.2.3.100 again.
The correct way however is to ask "Why do I want a different IP" and solve that. E.g. by talking with your network admin and getting a reserved IP, or setting a static IP (and you admin marking that IP as in used so she never gives that out again).
The DHCP server is in control of handing out DHCP addresses. That server decides which IP you get; not something you do on your local computer.
If you have control of the DHCP server and don't want the same IP address you currently have, your options include:
When you delete your new IP address lease with ipconfig /release it's up to the DHCP server to decide what IP address you get when you request a new lease.  The DHCP server will assign the "next available" IP address, which could easily be the address you just released.
