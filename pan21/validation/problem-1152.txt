I have tried running all of the above scripts outside of a login script and they always work perfectly - this problem only occurs when doing it from inside a login script.
If you create a share for the drive where the user profiles are located (typically C:\Users).  Assuming the share is PROFILE$, you can then use a script such as:  
Usually %TEMP% is prefixed with C:\Users\ on Windows Server 2008, which is why %temp:~9% is used, to remove that prefix.  If using Windows Server 2003, it would be %temp:~12%
When I log in with the above then the command window opens up and I can see the subst command being executed correctly, with the correct path. But still no T: drive.
This shows me the correct temp path when the user logs in - but still no T: Drive. Decided to resort to brute force and put this in my login script:   
My problem is that I need to "map" a drive letter to each users Temp folder. This is due to a legacy app that requries a separate Temp folder for each user but which does not understand %temp%.
The problem is that, even though the command runs, the subst doesn't "stick" and the user doesn't get a T: drive.
I found a passing reference on an MSFN forum about a similar problem when the user is already logged on to another machine - but I have this problem even without being logged on to another machine.
