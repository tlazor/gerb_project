If you have Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 then it can already be turned into a Domain Controller (DC) but you'll need to make sure you have the right licenses to make its use legal.
For what you are wanting to do (i.e. have staff be able to log in at any computer and the shared drives follow them around) then all the computers they will be logging in to will need to have (at least) the "Pro" versions of Windows (Windows 7 Pro, Windows 8 Pro, Windows 10 Pro) as these are the minimum versions that can be joined to a domain.
Having a domain will allow users to log on to any computer on the domain using a single username and password and you can configure things like shared drives, printers and many other settings from one central place (the server) and all the client computers will inherit these settings and everything just works.
The most frequently used license types are "User CALs" as they offer the most flexibility (one user license but the server can have multiple devices for one user and still be covered). Ideally if you have no idea what you're doing then professional assistance should be sought.
