Do you have any ideas what could be wrong with it and how could I go about getting my data back from it?
In my experience however, I'd suggest not following this at all. Writable media just doesn't last very long due to the fact that the written layer is a thin dye material, and not the silverized layer of commercial discs. Anything from sunlight to radon gas could damage it. The denser the storage medium, CD --> DVD --> Blu-Ray, the higher the chance of data loss due to the smaller features. Again this is my experience and not scientific fact.
I will say that disc and drive compatibility is definitely not guaranteed. A disc written in one drive may not play at all in another drive or DVD player. But usually they work in the same drive just fine (until the drive dies.) I tell my students to expect 10 years or less from any type of optical media today. It could just be a defective disc.
I thought maybe the drive failed, or the lens is dirty but other CDs/DVDs work fine. I tried reading it on two other laptops, alas, with no success.
The disc has no scratches that I can see, while some of the other ones are scratched all over and work without problems.
I had (well, still have) a DVD+R which I recorded. For a few years now it has been working without issues. When I tried it the other day, I couldn't read it, Windows couldn't even get a "start up" reading where it shows you the name of the disc, and the files on it.
