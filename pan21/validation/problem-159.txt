A ramdisk of course loses the data you store in it when the cloud VM/instance/server is restarted, so the async raid will help you retain your data. Though after every reboot the raid array will have to rebuild and performance will be slow until the rebuild is done...
Not all SAN's offer horrible disk performance btw, so you likely just need to shop around a bit. You are also likely aware of the cache plugins that can improve wordpress performance, but I suppose it should be mentioned that you may want to look into something like w3_total_cache, etc.
One option to improve disk performance in the cloud could be to buy a cloud hosting package with enough ram in it that you could then use the ram to create a ramdisk, setup an async raid (write mostly) with the cloud storage and ramdisk & enjoy rather fast read speeds, some data resiliency... and likely a rather large monthly bill. 
If you are concerned about data loss, buy from a host with a decent backup plan. Some of them even offer hourly backups.
