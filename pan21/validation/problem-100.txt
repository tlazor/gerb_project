(a) Why don't you login as otherAccount in the first place? (I guess there is a reason, but I just have to mention it).
Putting the password into .profile is a very bad idea, and it is the reason why su, sudo, ssh, and the like don't support reading the password from a file.
(b) Don't use passwords for login, but an SSH key. Use Putty to generate a key, and you should, nay, must really protect it with a passphrase. Run Putty Agent on your PC to supply this key to further ssh logins so you need to enter the ssh key passphrase only once (with Putty Agent, when it loads the key). Put the public key on the AIX machine into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys for your regular account and for otherAccount. Log in to the machine using the key; then use "ssh otherAccount@localhost" to log into otherAccount without entering the password.
If you are not accustomed to using public ssh keys with Putty and Putty Agent, you will have to read some documentation. Do it, it is worth it. Be aware that you'll have to export the public key from Putty in OpenSSH format -- Putty's native key format does not work with ~ssh/authorized_keys.
