Is there a tool which tells me which process is causing it? That includes if Windows is accessing the virtual memory? I tried SysInternals' DiskMon but it doesn't show useful information, like the process. The Task Manager shows some I/O counters but I still can't determine which one is doing it the most. Plus it doesn't show virtual memory access.
I FOUND IT!  It's a stupid piece of software called Seagate Dashboard, and it automatically installs itself in your 'puter when you plug in a Seagate external hard drive.  For some reason, this POS does something cyclically, about once a second.  Whatever it's doing involves RAM, and as usual Windows -- in combination with anti-virus software, which for some reason uses a dreadful lot of RAM -- has all the RAM occupied, so the machine has to resort to virtual RAM and starts driving the HD.  Getting the virtual RAM adjusted takes about a second -- just long enough for Seagate Dashboard to hit it AGAIN.  The system is constantly occupied with this cyclic RAM fiddling, which doesn't show up as an activity (!) and prevents anything else from working right.
right-click on it again and change "automatic" to "manual" -- or perhaps even "disable" -- so it won't bother you any more.
Sometimes my Windows 7 system is accessing the hard drive heavily for several minutes and it slows down the machine considerably. 
Go to Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Performance Information and Tools\Advanced Tools and start Resource Monitor.  You can see what's hitting the disk there.
