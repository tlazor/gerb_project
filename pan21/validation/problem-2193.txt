I am getting constant event 4625 messages saying that accounts are failing to log in with non-existent usernames. Names such as: SALES, USER, TEST, HELPDESK, SUPPORT, PROGRAMMER are not users of ours, but we are getting 20 or so messages every minute saying accounts such as these are trying to log in. I can only conclude that this must be a brute force attack. I have already made sure that RDP is NOT publicly accessible. I can tell that these are coming from outside of the domain because NTLM is stopping it, however I cannot blacklist IPs because Network information is blank in the event messages. What should I do in this situation?
Try looking in this log: Application and Service Logs > Microsoft > Windows> > RemoteDesktopServices-RdpCoreTS > Operational
See if there are any 140 events (generated when a fake name is used), or 131 events (failed but legit name). These should have a source IP in the description.
This information will be obfuscated so long as you have RDP set to negotiate security with TLS/SSL & NLA. If you reduce your security level down to just RDP encryption, you will fetch more info in those log entries. Obviously not an ideal approach, as that weakens your security posture.
Turn on NTLM authentication auditing and check 4776 failures in the log "Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\NTLM\Operational" to see the real source.
PureRDS had a good write-up about this earlier in the year: http://purerds.org/remote-desktop-security/auditing-remote-desktop-services-logon-failures-1/
