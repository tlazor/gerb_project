It may fix the problem . In many times, when I meet this kind of problem, you better backup your important data first, after that do check your system. 
Look for "EXE File Association Fix". It's made for Windows XP 32, and it worked for me on Vista 32, and I believe it also does on Windows 7 x64. I am on a Windows 7 x64 right now and checked some of they keys in the .reg file and it seems to have the same keys/values.
Once this happened to me in Vista, and the problem was that Windows lost the EXE file association, i.e. it didn't know what to do with EXE files.
Things happen. Hard drive sectors go bad and you lose important system files. I know it sucks but honestly it is probably the most stable solution.
When in doubt, reinstall. :) If you are a good computer user, everything important is already backed up. Also a win7 install takes about 20-30mins on a good computer. Heck it only took an hour when I installed it on a p4.
Try running System File Checker. Hit Win+R and type sfc /scannow and enter. This will take a while, when it's done, restart your computer.
