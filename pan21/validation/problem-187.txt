I am stomped on this one.  Got a batch of 16 SATA drives.  They have the right label from WD, but also come with a sticker on them that's in an Asian language.  The drives are supposed to be 4TB, but everything I've done with them shows them as 5TB.  Here's the output of "smartctl -a" on one:
Manufacturing mistake in labeling and applying wrong model numbers in firmware? It's not unprecedented, and it can happen. Typically, these are isolated incidents. Just be glad you got some free TBs out of it.
Manufacturing mistake in labeling and applying wrong model numbers in firmware?  Cheap knockoffs?  They weren't particularly much cheaper than their usual price, maybe by a few bucks.
I have written known data to the whole disk via "dd" and then read it back.  It all checked out, down to the last byte.  I currently have 8 of them in a RAID6.  They built just fine with a capacity of 30005.88 GB and even do resync without an issue.  Everything I've done to these indicates that they're 5TB drives, but the firmware says otherwise.
