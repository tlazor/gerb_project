As you find things in relation, you can change the names of the tables and then create synonyms for their past naming convention. Then when you can process change requests with your folks who need to access those table names, you can slowly remove the synonyms as they change their reference points.
At the very least, I'd recommend to start a data dictionary or you can possibly begin adding better naming to the extended properties of tables in the database.
I've used this frequently and it helps me. I'm thinking that if the table names aren't consistent, hopefully the column names are consistent or close. If they aren't, hopefully your data types and sizes are.
If the diagram tool did not work for you, that likely means there are no foreign keys or constraints which will make things difficult for you. Max has already stated about third party tools, and you said there is no similar naming convention. To me, this leaves two pieces that are in SQL Server and neither are great and you'll have to do some manual work. 
You may have to adjust the ORDER BY section by column_name or data type, but it will help sort the metadata of the tables in your database and you can find things related or similar to each other.
