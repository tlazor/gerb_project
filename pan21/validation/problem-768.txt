to list all installed packages. This will also list the ones from repos. Then you could compare against the repo installed ones, eliminate the duplicates, and find your locally installed ones.
will help you. it will show not only local-installed packages but also all packages that you didn't update since first install OS...so It's not very useful if you have many non-updated packages.
So far I have a list of explicit packages that are installed with yum. The server has some of its own developed software which would not be from a repo, it would be moved and then installed locally. Is there a way to find out which packages/software have been installed this way?
To find a certain packae or drop the grep and list all installed packages via yum. But if you install from source (which is I assume what you are doing - you didn't specify) they wouldn't be tracked by yum. If they have been installed from source, the normal procedure would be to download the source files to /usr/src and run make and make install from there. So normally, you would have all the source files in the /usr/src folder. But, if anyone has installed software without placing the source files there, or they have deleted the source since installing it you wouldn't find them there.
