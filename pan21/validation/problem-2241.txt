I think, a reasonable compromise to replicate the Start button functionality is to build tiles corresponding to the features offered through the Start button & group them together.
The shortcut is actually to C:\Windows\explorer.exe and then takes the path to the VBS as a param. You can also add an icon for your button here by hitting "Change Icon..." - I threw in a nice pink one.
Scott Hanselman has a nice article on how you can customize Start menu options as shortcuts and then make them accessible through Tiles.
For instance, to Shutdown the PC with a single click, create a shortcut on the desktop with the Target set to c:\Windows\System32\Shutdown.exe -s -t 00. To make this shortcut appear as a Tile on the Metro Home screen, right click on the desktop shortcut and select Pin to Start from context menu. 
Not sure at all if this is what you want, but I was frustrated by the lack of mouse support for activating the Win8 Start Screen (which imo is grand for getting at apps once you have it open).
The hotspots are slow and fiddly with a mouse, so I pinned my own makeshift "Start" button to the taskbar which simply opens the existing Win8 Start Screen - no need for any apps to be installed.
