I tried using the mv command in my terminal on my mac to move files into a directory.  The files were moved, however it seems that I made a mistake i in my command and did not use a using a trailing slash at the end of my directory name.  So a file was created instead.  I ran the command multiple times thinking that I was moving the files into my newly created directory.  When I tried to CD to the directory, my terminal gave me a notice saying "XX" is not a directory.  I then tried to open the file and it gave me an error.
You don't need a trailing / when moving files - you need to move multiple files to a directory that already exists. (ie mkdir -p /usr/share/foo/bar && mv /opt/foo/* /usr/share/foo/bar).
You may be able to run strings on it as well and get some (mostly) human readable text info that may be used in various bits of output if it is a binary program.
EDIT - come to think of it, my Linux boxes all warn me about last argument not being a directory if I try to move many to one spot that doesn't exist...  What command did you run exactly?
That said, your file-not-a-directory is whatever file moved last.  If OS X has it, I'd use the file utility to try and determine what type it was, but I think either OS X or a Linux  will still recognize it as a file and open with the appropriate application if double-clicked - assuming of course that it is a data file.
