Reading back over this I figured I should say what I did which gives an almost identical feel to Linux. I used Cygwin (this can be configured with a Makefile, bash, etc. so it is almost identical to a bash console in Linux). Windows does, however, work a bit differently than Linux, so for times that I need to actual compile/run my code on a Linux machine, I created a virtual machine.
If you are a true Linux user then you will love mono. That is what I use to program in Ubuntu. They have a version for Windows, here is the link 
Now, I don't like having to work with a bunch of different screens, so I enabled SSH from my native (Windows) OS to the virtual (Linux) OS through the cygwin terminal. This allows me to minimize the VM, but still use the Linux Kernel to run my code on from the standard Windows OS.
I am a semi-experienced Linux user and I write my software explicitly from command line. If I need a compiler, I simply sudo-apt-get it, if I need to run a code I just execute it from command line and if I need to edit my sourcefiles, I simply use Vim and program from the terminal.
Code::Blocks is a great Windows (and Linux!) IDE and if you download the version without a built in compiler you can use MinGW-Builds which has the latest GCC (multiple languages supported) for Windows.  MinGW-Builds also has both 32-bit and 64-bit compiler versions available.  It includes many header files, like DirectX and others, that are useful on Windows.
What is the best way to start programming in Windows 8 for free? I am installing a VM which will run linux, but some things like CUDA programming will not work correctly on it.
