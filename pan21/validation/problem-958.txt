Run a traceroute off the Ubuntu server when you see the outage. This will show you which connection is actually failing. I'm guessing that it's probably an ISP outage or, if you're using a consumer grade router, the router its self. Don't forget to check cables.
There are no settings in the server edition that would cause this from the ubuntu side.  What happens when you open up a console on the machine? (i.e. plug in a monitor and keyboard).  It sounds like a hardware error to me ... could be anything from bad ram to a nic that isn't being handled correctly.  Can you place another device on the router and see if it has similar access problems? (To eliminate the router)
Do you have a backup server  ? If yes, it would be good to make sometests like memtest, and connect back-to-back the server's machine with something else, let's say a laptop and see the results. You could also test the hard disks.
There may also be the possibility of the power management features of your BIOS as well as inactivity timer/timing from your ISP/router (if you are running into this remotely too).
