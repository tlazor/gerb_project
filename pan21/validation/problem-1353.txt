Once I have found a solution to the problem I deploy it, and leave the monitoring in place until I am confident that the problem has been resolved.
By the way, unmanaged equipment has no place in a production network, as you have probably figured out by now. Debugging problems in a LAN without access to at least SNMP on the switches is a huge headache. And if you are unlucky a single patch between two network ports somewhere in the network is enough to make your network crash and burn...
Finding the source of this kind of problem can be extremely frustrating, especially if they are rare. However, this is how I approach intermittent network problems
You also might want to browse the Watchguard's logs to see if any entries would correlate to the reported connection teardowns. The same goes for the client's logs to see if it might have lost the connection and/or reconfigured the IP interface.
For diagnosis, you could take an analytic approach by running a full packet trace (using Wireshark or Network Monitor) on one of the affected stations until the issue occurs and looking at the trace for possible clues for why the UDP packet exchange of the Skype connection has been interrupted (as the Skype call is likely to be the only heavily-used UDP-based protocol at the time of the call, you should be able to identify the stream easily). You might see something like an ICMP-destination-unreachable packet from one of the routers in the path which would give you a hint about where to look further or just the absence of any response packets for any requests indicating that it is a connectivity problem between the client and the rest of the network.
Also, consider possible points of failure and try recording connectivity data from behind these points, e.g.
Step 1 and 2 should be relatively straight forward. A drawing on a whiteboard with the complete path and the involved systems is helpful. For step 3 I tend to use Nagios or other longterm monitoring solutions. There are many plugins for nagios which may be useful, and you can configure it to monitor many properties of the systems with a very high resolution from your NOC. The monitoring has two purposes. One is to gather information for later debugging, but it also informs you about problems which lets you correlate them more easily to sources. When it comes to intermittent network connectivity issues I make sure to configure the routing monitoring and connectivity tests to all systems along the path.
If you have something which is actually breaking a Skype call with only a short outage for actual connectivity (<15s), this probably would be something actively tearing down the connection.
