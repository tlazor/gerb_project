I'm going to buy a new computer, and I'd want to know (in terms of performance) which option is better. Obviously, the best idea is to combine them (SSD for the OS and RAID0 for the data). However, I wouldn't want to spend lots of money in storage.
Again, this is all in the context of what you are using the system for. If you use the system just for browsing the internet, occasionally transfer large files, raid 0 HDD is certainly good enough and reliably enough for the purpose.
I would go with SSD any day, and RAID0 is not very safe (if one drive fails you won't be able to extract useful data - you mentioned in terms of performance, but I think this is always a good thing to point out since performance can be measured in many ways. Such as reliability performance etc). Also it is probably not sequential speed alone you are looking for but random access and IOPS at low Queue Depths (QD 1-4). Even if it is a gaming computer, the performance will be noticeable in almost very other aspect of usage as well. I have run RAID0 mechanical disks and then replaced with my first SSD a few years back and the difference was huge. Personally I would not go back to RAID0.
I have the raid 0 mechanical drives for years, they are very reliable for day to day home use, the speed is adequate.
Your computer will definitely feel faster - at the very least, get a 256GB SSD for OS and then perhaps one mechanical for storage. At 512GB SSD you'll be able to push some games in as well. Prices for SSDs are low enough to be able to recommend a 256GB at the very least to almost any budget for upgrades I think.
