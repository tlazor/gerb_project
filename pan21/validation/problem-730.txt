"IP (or UDP) is unreliable" means there is no built-in mechanism to see data loss.  Many protocols over UDP use their own mechanisms to detect (and possibly correct) the data loss: perhaps the simplest is sequence numbers in syslog messages ("000019: %SYS-5-CONFIG_I: Configured from console by vty2 (10.34.195.36)"
"TCP provides reliability" means that it provides a promise to the sender that data will be delivered reliably if it's possible given the underlying transport. This is at the expense of taking more time.  It's like a courier's proof-of-delivery: they keep trying to deliver it, and if it gets there, and the proof reached you, then you know it was delivered.  If the outward transmission or the return acknowledgement fails, you don't know it was delivered, but it might have been.
IP is how the data (TCP, UDP, or other) makes it from one host to another ... it is the forwarding.  TCP specifies how those hosts implement a reliable connection over a packet-based network layer with no delivery guarantee, with sequencing, windowing, and retransmission.
It may sound weird but once you get used to the idea that "TCP packet" is shorthand for "TCP segments carried within IP packets" and "UDP packets" is shorthand for "UDP datagrams within IP packets", it becomes less confusing.
TCP doesn't actually send packets.  It uses segments, which are sequenced messages sent between hosts by IP in packets.
Finally, you have to consider what you want to happen when packets are lost.  If it's to retry until something gets there, TCP is excellent.  If -- such as in live audio such as a phone call -- the only thing to do is throw away late data, TCP is no good, and most streaming uses UDP with its own error detection.
TCP can only deliver reliability if the transport permits it.  Consider "is there a host at 1.2.3.4?": with 99% packet loss TCP (eg HTTP) will probably fail to get any bytes delivered; ping or UDP on the other hand, will quite likely get a packet through and back eventually.  The difference between "is it off" and "is it performing very badly" can be important.
"Ethernet is reliable" on the other hand, normally means the actual number of errors is very low.  Both a) the receiver knows its frames haven't been corrupted (because of checksums), and b) in practice, the actual error rate is very low (because switches prevent collisions, electrical spec is excellent and covers many source of error.  All the routers' interfaces I just looked at have byte counts in the gigabytes and zero errors of any kind; the actual specs require bit error rates from about 10^-10 to 10^-13 depending on medium, speed etc.
TCP adds a ready-made reliable-delivery-notification mechanism, as well as turning lumpy packet transmission into byte streams, which are usually more useful.
