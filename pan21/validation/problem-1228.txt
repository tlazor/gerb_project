I hope that this answers all you questions.  Here are a few link that I found to help me write this, and I would highly recommend looking them up.
The Wikipedia article says that carbon-based ones are the best, but of course, are the most expensive. So it's really a matter of what you can afford.
As little as possible. The thermal solution is less conductive than the heatsink or the processor, and if you have too much there's a risk of inserting air bubbles (air is a horrible conductor of heat). A very thin layer is best.
Since your motherboard should already be off, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. It's even less of a problem if you don't use metal-based thermal paste, since those can short your motherboard. Wipe it off using a nice anti-static cloth.
People say you need it because you might build up static in your body and discharge it into your motherboard, killing it. It's really up to you, the risk of frying your motherboard is small, but the anti-static bracelet makes the risk even smaller.
100Â°F is normal for a CPU, but yes, thermal paste will lower the temperature by getting rid of air bubbles in the space between the CPU and heatsink.
Common-sense, essentially. Don't work on it in a preschool, a waterpark, and especially not in a prison cell (the moisture is bad). Darth Vader's lair should be fine as long as you're on the Dark Side.
