using two SSIDs to differentiate between 2.4 and 5ghz network no longer has any merits as devices became much more intelligent. The way this trends indicates which was the "right" path all along.
This is better than having to choose the 5 GHz band only setting in advance settings as there will be many other places where you need to connect to both bands. Now I get great Wi-Fi speeds at home instead of competing against the crowded 2.4 band at home. Hope this helps. 
I think I found a solution for Androids that prioritize the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band over the 5 GHz band with the same SSID if you access a dual band router at home for example. If both bands have the same SSID find out which band your Android device is currently connected to using the free inSSIDer app. My was connected to channel 6 instead of channel 161 (my desired 5 GHz channel). Move to a location where you can confirm that you are connected to the 2.4 GHz band (hit the refresh button as needed on the top of inSSIDer to update) When you verify that you are connected to the 2.4 GHz band, go back to your Wi-Fi settings, you will see your SSID twice with the top one being the 2.4 GHz connection select that and select Forget. 
Depending on your network card, you may be able to configure it in the driver.  For example, in Windows 8:
Having the same name causes havoc when setting up wifi extenders. I had to enable Guest mode on the 2.4 band to differentiate between the two
