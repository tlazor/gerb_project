So my question is how do you send the movement of the mouse to the server. Do you send the direction and speed that the mouse is moving each update and interpolate it or something else. The problem I can see with interpolating something like a mouse is that in an FPS it is required to be very accurate and interpolating is literally guessing. Any advice would be appreciated.
So I have a server-client model FPS set up. It uses udp to send data between the two with the server having a constant tick rate of 100 ticks per second (It updates movement 100 times a second) on the server with the client doing update of its key states etc 30 times a second and for keys the system works well. But now my question is how would I send the mouse movement to the server as this in not an on/off system is is constantly changing.
The other problem that I see is that to get a direction vector of a mouse you would have to wait for enough movement to get the vector.
Another idea has come to me and that is just sending the direction that the client thinks its looking when it shoots.
Would you happen to be using a socket server? Or what kind of networking system Do you use? Having a stream of floats going over the network should not cause an issue, if you use a setting on that rpc like transmission set to "reliable" (if you have this kind of system) that can cause the packet buffer to overflow on the server and cause overhead. if this can handle some list packets you should be just fine using a system like this.
