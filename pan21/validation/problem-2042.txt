I'll point out that the patch is not a great fix and can actually cause more problems if it is not used consistently by all the Mac users (which is why it has not been applied to Subversion itself).  There is work underway to solve the problem in a more complete fashion but that work is not complete yet.
There's no reason to install the patch on CentOS.  The Mac Users need to use the patch.  Probably the easiest way for them to get a patched version is to use brew with the --unicode-path option when they install e.g. brew install --unicode-path subversion.
Doesn't work for me on OSX El Capitan. The problem in my system was about the repository with the same filename (but just different UTF8 representations in OSX and main svn repo), the solution is to use a patched svn that compares the file names using the "canonical" format of UTF8 filenames; here you can find additional info about the bug.
There is a rather lengthy document about this in the notes section of the Subversion source and our wiki page has some more current thoughts about how to fix it.
Perhaps the easiest solution to this issue right now is to avoid using paths with characters that have composed forms.
