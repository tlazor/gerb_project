What we are trying to do is create a subdirectory on example1.com called example1.com/example2. This will point to example2.com, but we want our users to stay at example1.com/example2 in their browser. So, it's like a redirect without actually being a redirect. How the hell do I go about doing this? Is this even possible? I'm looking at squid docs in the meantime.
Move all website content from the directory root to a subdirectory called /example2/ on the example2.com web server.
Here's the setup. We have a hardware load balancer with an http virtual cluster. Let's call this virtual cluster example1.com. This virtual cluster load balances between two squid reverse proxies which are also on the same physical servers as the web servers. Squid listens on 80 and points to itself as the cache_peer web server which listens on 81. We also have a standalone web server which we will call example2.com.
I might be missing something here, but this actually sounds pretty straight forward. Load balance all requests where the URL path matches ^/example2/ to the example2.com web server.
