The index.php redirect works fine, as does the "directory" name -> php file redirect. However, I can't figure out how to do several things: Implement the trailing-slash fix, and externally redirecting .php files so that I don't have any duplicate files. I want all pages to look clean, like /help, /about, etc. The real pages on the server are /about.php format. Also, I can't get the rewrite rule for the images working. I want anything that's not a real file or directory (-e flag) and not a rewritable file (like /about) to redirect to generation/etc...
You're going about it wrong. Nginx loves location blocks, for instance to redirect /index.php to / you'd do.
You'll also want to look into try_files. In general, if you're using an if in Nginx then chances are you're doing it wrong.
I'm new to nginx's rewrite engine. I'm trying to convert my old htaccess file over to nginx's format but I'm running into some trouble.
I recommend reading this for a basic introduction on how Nginx uses server blocks and location blocks: http://blog.martinfjordvald.com/2010/07/nginx-primer/
