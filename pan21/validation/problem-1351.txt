The handiest answer I've come across is to use the passwd command in conjunction with dscl.  Here is the output from an interactive session (with the passwords replaced by asterices):
Keep in mind that the password on each user's Login keychain is normally kept synchronized with their Open Directory password.  Mac OS X is smart enough to use the password entered at the login window to not only authenticate the user against OD, but also unlock their keychain.  If the two passwords get out of sync, it will be inconvenient and confusing for most users.
these commands can run from the local machine or a remote machine. The remote client must be connected to the directory in Directory Utility. A remote authentication check from an authorized machine looks like
AFAIK, none of the methods of changing the OD password on the server side are able to modify the user's keychain password.  However, the people at AFP548 create a solution to this problem called Keychain Minder that helps users who get into this situation.
man passwd refers to an OpenSSL tool that computes password hashes.  To get the man page for the passwd command you really want, man /usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1.gz is more useful.
Here is a python script to make the changes.  You will need the pexpect module (sudo easy_install pexpect should get it for you; I don't think you need the dev tools installed).
