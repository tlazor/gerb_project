IN/OUTBOUND traffic (as suggested by voretaq7) , CPU, memory, disk usage, and disk IO are of the keys to achieve this. How to do it may vary according to the hosting solution you're using..
Note that this only addresses OUTBOUND attacks - As you noted there are other things you need to consider to adequately protect your server itself. That would be an interesting follow-up question.
Proper isolation between clients along with some restrict resources limitations would be the answer.
This may frustrate legitimate users, but it will also prevent malicious users from launching attacks from your server.
Beyond that you can restrict outbound network access (either with PHP settings or through a firewall - the latter being preferable).
If you let people execute arbitrary code in an unrestricted environment there is very little you can do to make it "secure" -- When I worked for an ISP that provided shared hosting with PHP we mitigated this by only selling to companies/individuals we had vetted to some extent to ensure they weren't J. Random. Haxor looking for a platform to launch attacks from, and honestly that's the best solution to this problem.
