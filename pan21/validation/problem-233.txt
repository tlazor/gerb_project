That said, SCCM 2012 and later can deploy applications to OS X in a very similar way to how it deploys applications to Windows clients. If you're already leveraging SCCM, you can extend it to support OS X with minimal effort and maintain a single pane of glass into your client configuration.
The JAMF Casper Suite of products is the industry leader for OS X deployment and management. Think of it as being very similar in function to SCCM for Windows machines.
Currently, I simply have a new Apple ID created under the staff's office email address and add in gift card credit (to avoid tying down a company CC to the account). And then manually download the relevant apps.
An option that I know of would be to use Novell ZENworks as it supports the OSX environment.  You can research more about it here:
I am wondering what is the proper way to deploy applications on OS X that will be scalable as my company grows. Especially applications that are only available on the App Store like Keynote, Pages, Numbers
Novell typically is less expensive than Microsoft solutions.  But is also less reliable in my professional experience.  This option may not be feasible as you're dealing with a relatively small client base (cost x users).
There were ideas of just having one Apple ID shared across all macbooks, but I am sure there are legal/licensing issues behind that.
