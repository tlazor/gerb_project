The web interface for the nodes says "Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller 8", not sure if this influences the operations.
I have 2 nodes running and I can access the iDrac web interface of those 2 nodes. For the chassis, I can get to the web interface but the credentials are invalid.
(iwork4dell) Sounds like what you need to do is reset the credentials on the CMC.  Resetting the CMC password on FX2 requires physical access.  The procedure is here:
Dell Chassis Management Controller Version 1.3 for PowerEdge FX2/FX2s User's Guide > Troubleshooting and recovery > Resetting Forgotten Administrator Password
Is there a way I can reset the chassis iDrac credentials from within the node? The nodes are windows 2016 servers and I can access them with no problem, but I am having a hard time figuring out how to reset the chassis credentials.

I cannot access the chassis drac web interface, since I received it configured with a username and password already configured, and the credentials I were given do not work.
