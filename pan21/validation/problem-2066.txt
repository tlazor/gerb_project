By using a staging table you can also massage the incoming data very easily in that same stored procedure IE: if for some reason the incoming file lists prices in a weird format you could correct that to match your current database formats.
The way I normally accomplish this is to have the application load the data into a staging table and not directly into the orders table.  Then you have the application call a stored procedure that holds all the logic mapping customer names to customer ID's and inserts that corrected data to the order_details table.
Assuming that Customer_details table is populated you can do lookups on the fly with LOAD DATA INFILE by leveraging session variables and a SET clause
First load the csv file in a temporary table with all columns like the csv input. Afterwards you can do an insert into order_details with a join to get the cust_id:
Also by using a staging table if you have multiple people using this program you can set a job on the database server to run the SP at some interval (and not have the app call it on demand).  Then people could continually load data into the staging table and if the data is not correct, you could kick it out and notify the person who added the data (if you have that tracking as part of your table).
