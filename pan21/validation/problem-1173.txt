Open up the .xlsx in that and just take a look at all the elements within the file and see if anything is obviously extraneous. This may require knowledge of XML and of the specific OpenXML schemas, but it's a surefire way to find out what is causing the bloat.
One simple fix is to copy and paste just the relevant data from that spreadsheet to a new one, then save it in .xlsx format, and see how small it is. If it's very small then you have your answer -- Excel is doing poor accounting of its internal file format's data structures.
P.S. -- if this kind of thing annoys you, stop using Microsoft formats / programs or suggest to your customer to do so. If you google around for "Microsoft Access database bloat" you'll see that Microsoft has a long history of letting their proprietary formats leak tons of useless data to disk that never gets cleaned up. It's like a really nasty memory leak that eats your disk instead of your RAM.
Also check for complicated or circular formulas and references to external sheets (especially those on network drives). If you think a formula might be slow, you can step through it using the formula auditing tool.
Last thing: if you save it as an .xlsx and it's still big, try downloading the OpenXML SDK Productivity tool: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5124
Try to "remove personal information" (a feature of Excel/Word/etc.) to clean up certain kinds of cruft that might be sitting in the file.
Are you using the binary .xls format or the new XML-based .xlsx format? In general the .xlsx format results in a dramatic reduction in filesize.
