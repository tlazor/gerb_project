If an application opens a connection (successfully) to SQL Server, and leaves it open in anticipation of sending a (or possible 'another') query, and in the meantime, SQL kills that connection for some reason (eg, service restarts, or a kill command is sent), then when the connection (which thinks it's open) tries to send a command, you'll get this error.
I ran across the same error a while back and meant to post my answer, but I couldn't log in and simply forgot. I happened upon this question again and will give my answer as best as I can remember as it's quite obscure and I could find no mention of it anywhere else.
I got exactly the same error in my application. It updates many records in single transaction. I fixed this by increasing SqlCommand.CommandTimeout parameter.
This error is returned from MS-SQL databases when passing some form of invalid date to an SP from .NET (and potentially other sources). IIRC, I was passing in a .NET MinDate (ie. default value). Basically, just check your date parameters and make sure they are sensible!
I mostly see this error if for some reason the network connectivity was lost, even for a few seconds. That could be someone disconnecting a cable, an unstable wifi connection, a bad network switch, computer that goes to sleep (it's on by default on Win7 and up), Windows update updating a network driver, etc.
