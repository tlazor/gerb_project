when I'm starting my MBP I get about 10-60 seconds of the booting process before the screen goes half black (Its like applying a black to transparent gradient from the left side of the screen to the middle of the screen). After a 5 seconds the entire screen blacks out and the MBP shuts down.
There have been issues with heat and some minor artifacts on the screen in the past but nothing serious as far as I know. Everything could be resolved by rebooting or letting the MBP cool down a bit.
I would try to reset the PRAM/NVRAM for starters and see if it helps, but it does indeed sound like a GPU failure. The cost of replacing it is upstream of $500 at Apple, because you'd need a logic board replacement as well.
For clarity, there have not been any 2007 MacBook Pros manufactured with ATI cards; yours is a 2006 model. I see some reports of failed GPUs in that family reported on the Apple forums.
There is NO separate "power supply" in this era system - if it's got a power system issue, it would be on board the logic board, in which case you need to say a prayer and bury it.
i would try starting in safe mode (boot and hold the SHIFT key until you've got the apple and the "grey grinding wheel")....  
Either way, (LCD or logic board), I'd not put any money into this system - it's well beyond its prime and I'd very heartily recommend an upgrade.. The logic boards are known for failure...
