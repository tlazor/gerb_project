I'm sure the above applies to some other wiki software as well but it's unlikely to apply to what you may consider "lightweight" software. Wikis are dynamic beasts with a powerful tendency to grow. Why impose unnecessary limits that you may later regret? 
You may want to look into foswiki.org. It works fine with Apacheauth (no worrying about the wiki logon being safe), and happily accepts LDAP Auth through Apache. It saves the posts in plain text files and is easily expanded by plugins. The learning curve is nice and flat, although it is a rather powerful software if you wish to delve deeply. 
I run a copy on my laptop to record all those bits of information that others put on paper. When the time came to install a wiki for the company intranet I simply copied it from my laptop to the server and created an empty database for it. Add an extension for authentication against Active Directory and it was ready to go. One advantage of using MediaWiki is that it scales very well, so I don't need to learn one system for personal use and another for the company intranet. The ability to easily copy articles between them is an added bonus.
I'll stick to MediaWiki. It may be heavy in the features it offers but it's incredibly easy to set up, configure and use. The tremendous number of extensions available means you are quite likely to find one already made for any kind of customisation you desire.
I know you said Dokuwiki and MediaWiki were both a bit heavy, but you can simplify the installation process to a few clicks by checking the packages here:
