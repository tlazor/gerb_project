Once those messages are found, they can be added to the Blackberry by selecting the message and 'Add' or 'Add All'.
Alternative workarounds could be to install a POP/IMAP client, obviously you'll need to then enable reprocipal service on your mail server and convert your MD's mail file.
I've tried Google but there doesn't seem to be any way of doing this without having access to the old unit and doing a backup/restore.
If a user has OS 4.5 or higher on his device and is on a BES of a certain minimum version, they can do a remote email search. Hit 'S' in the Messages screen and change the search type to 'Remote'. This searches through email on the server mailbox.
