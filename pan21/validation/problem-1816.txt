On the local network connection in control panel, right-click -> properties -> select ipv4 click properties, click advanced. Somewhere there is a box to set the metric. Enter 1 in this box and see what happens. If this then bypasses your 3g dongle, we'll have to fix it by manually editing the routing table. I'll get you instructions as soon as I get near a windows PC (which may not be today, sorry)
That will work you just have to add all the routes you might need to access to the table to route out your lan card.  (for example, maybe your mail server is on 10.113.149.1 or something).  Basically, however big your companies subnet is.
Basically, that route table is saying if its on your local lan subnet, 10.113.148.x, use your lan card.  the default routes are there for both, (the 0.0.0.0, which means "unknown"), but the 3g card has a MUCH lower priority.  
if all of your company is on a 10.113.x.x network, add another route, for 10.113.0.0 255.255.0.0 to go to your local gateway, 10.113.148.71.  (often there are other subnets that are involved.
Yep I can see the problem. You see the second line in the route table? that basically overrides all other connections, because it has such a small metric value.
