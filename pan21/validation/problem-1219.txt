However, if your workload instead consists of many parallel file accesses---such as would occur in a file server being hit by multiple users at once---then RAID1 will be faster than a single disk because the concurrent read requests are allocated across multiple disk spindles.
Are you currently using a Linux software RAID5? If so, a "sucking" read performance would not be normal, there must be a reason for it. 
The "far" layout may give you better read performance (see http://neil.brown.name/blog/20040827225440). Apart of that RAID1 with md gives redundancy, but no speed boost.
RAID1 is mirroring, so you can't expect any speed increases. RAID0 (striping) does indeed increase the speed, up to the factor 2, but less in reality. 
Single-threaded application performance on mdadm RAID1 is indeed no better than using a single disk. That's because mdadm chooses one of the disks in the array to satisfy a given read request. So if your workload consists of a single process reading sequentially from a single file, then mdadm RAID1 will not outperform a single disk.
In summary, whether or not mdadm RAID1 will be faster than a single disk depends a lot on your particular mix of workloads.
