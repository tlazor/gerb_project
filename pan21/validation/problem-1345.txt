This usually requires a decent server and cheap hardware a.k.a. "dumb" terminal workstations, which simply connect to your server and display what is essentially a virtual machine, sometimes just within a browser.  The server is actually running the software and doing the grunt work, although the average user may not be aware given the user experience can 
One of the irritating side effects was that the monitors on the workstations almost always used to be dimmer than "ordinary" computers monitors.
There is a technology called NX Server. It is client-server. You can afford you not a virtual machines but real evironment with Graphical User Interface (with mouse and keyboard) working separately for every connected client. If you run Linux on your server you will find a free software called FreeNX, here is the documentation from Ubuntu.  
If you are considering implementing this type of infrastructure, it has been around for some time, so be sure to read and learn from the experiences and advice of others.  I don't think it generally matters if you want to go with wired or wireless connections (I have seen networks using both), but I suspect those more learned might make various arguments for wired.
Yes, there is something called NComputing, which was used at the startup I had earlier worked for. You have a server on which the NComputing card and software is installed. The workstations consist of a monitor, keyboard and a mouse. If I am not wrong, the workstations were connected to the server via ordinary LAN cables.
There is a limit on the physical distance between the server and the workstations. The number of workstations is dependant on the capacity of the NComputing card.
