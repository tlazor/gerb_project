I ran my router as virtual host on VMWare ESXi. I had no problem doing so and the box was rather reliable as a custom built server. It requires some knowledge on how everything routes together, and unfortunately, I don't really remember how I did everything. The only problem I'm immediately aware of is that VoIP has some issues running as a virtual machine. So you'll need to do some research to ensure that your application will run alright with whatever kernels are available on your hypervisor.
I don't know why this shouldn't be stable and reliable. Depending on the virtualization technique and the hardware, the virtualization of the network might be more expensive then doing it natively.
if you use dynamips  ( http://www.ipflow.utc.fr/index.php/Cisco_7200_Simulator ) for instance, this will run your router in a MIPS virtual machine.
I have been running a VM as a router for a network I manage for over a year through Hyper-V on server 2008 R2.  The only things to keep in mind are to disable the host machine's access to at least one NIC you're routing across, and that you'll need to set the VM up to automatically turn on.  The setup I have is that the VM routes external traffic into the DMZ and the physical box does the routing for the internal network (3 NICs needed).
