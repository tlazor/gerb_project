If your company cannot withstand downtime for the users, VMware FT is your choice then. To implement this feature, you'll definetely need some kind of shared storage. For the case, I would recommend looking at software-defined storage (SDS) solutions that are increasingly being used for building virtualized infrasructures. With this approach, you can virtualize the local physical storage resources of your ESXi hosts and turn them into a fully-fledged virtual SAN. VMware VSAN springs immediately to mind, but I would point out some very interesting alternatives that should be much cheaper to implement at ESXi environment. The first candidate is HPE VSA: good level of functionality and an annoying requiremnt of a third voting node for a quorum. Yeah, I know, you can still go 2 nodes, but if you're not ok with downtime, the quorum is a must. The second candidate, on the contrary, has minimalistic hardware footprint with just two physsical hosts along with set of the features like caching, data compression etc. It is StarWind vSAN. The both solutions have free versions, just check and see how you would benefit from them.
The technology you would be best served by is "software defined storage". A VM that makes locally attached disks available to all VMs, ideally providing redundancy by allowing the use of local disks on multiple nodes at the same time (allowing you to lose a node without losing all your VMs). Since we're not talking about product recommendations, I'll leave it at this. It's still a nascent market, but there are some well established options that would fit the bill.
