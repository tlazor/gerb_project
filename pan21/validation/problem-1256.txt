Your DNS server is authoritative for mydomain.mycompany.com. So every request for this domain will be answered by your server. Every request for other domains will be forwarded to the next DNS server. If you setup a reverse lookup zone then your server will check reverse lookups if the IP is in his own range and answer them, otherwise forward the request to the next DNS server.
Your server has not setup a reverse lookup zone, so every request is forwarded to the next DNS server. So if you reverse lookup an IP of one of your own computers in mydomain.mycompany.com this will not work, but if you reverse lookup an IP from somebody else (like 173.194.69.104 for www.google.com) then the authoritative server for this IP range will answer.
Let's assume you have setup an active directory domain with the DNS domain mydomain.mycompany.com and setup all clients to use this DNS server.
According to your comment you have reverse looked up an IP that is not in your own domain. In this case everything is working as expected.
