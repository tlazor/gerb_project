The reasoning is this is a public internet access (kiosk more or less) computer but we want the user to be able save files to a usb stick but not have the ability to save files to the machine or execute files from the usb stick.
If I were you, I would setup the kiosks to run as dumb LTSP terminals, and start the users with a completely clean environment with every session. There are all sorts of ways to do this... my college had an XTerminal lab running on some ancient Unix back in 1994.
If I were you, I'd leave the USB stick read-write (as that makes a lot of sense), but I'd set your machine's partitions to read-only.  If you lock down X enough (prevent anyone from opening a shell via xterm, for example), then it should be a piece of cake.
Unless you control the USB sticks, write-only isn't going to work well. You're going to end up with all sorts of support issues and grousing by your users.
It might be easier to just chroot execute the browser, with the USB-stick mounted under the chrooted jail.
