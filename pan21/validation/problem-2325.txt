Since you just moved, you might want to try reseating (removing and re-inserting) anything that could have come loose in the move, particularly the memory and the video card (if you have a dedicated video card).
Also, I'd try another PSU. Maybe yours for some reason ain't delivering the necessary power to completely boot the machine (I've had this issue)
i've moved to another house , and today i just plugged in my pc's power cable ,then my pc (HP COMPAQ desktop) turned on as if i pressed the power button) ,but it doesn't show anything on the monitor ,the monitor is working with my other pc, i tried to figure out what the problem is , removing RAM doesn't give me the 2 beeps nor a message on the screen (screen is black all the time) , removing the CPU : the green light on the desktop becomes, a kind of, blue , also removing the HDD turns the green light of hdd activity, to blue, another problem is , when pressing the power button it doesn't shut down the pc ,i can hear all the fans running (including the PSU fan ) so, what should i do now , thanks guys
