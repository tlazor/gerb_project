And great number of Windows computers are vulnerable to port 139 exploit. This port is open by default and unfortunately it is very dangerous.
Second answer - Subnets are divided by routers. Most often routers have firewalls. And most often sysadmins close unnecessary and dangerous ports on them to prevent unauthorized access and viruses spreading around.
Even if infected machine will know addresses of computers in different subnet - the firewall will not allow the virus to spread (if necessary ports are blocked).
A worm (also like it's biological counterpart) is an independent process that looks for susceptible hosts (machines on the net in this case) to which to spread. 
A virus (like its biological counterpart) hijacks other activity (running an infected program, booting infected media) to take control (to search for other susceptible hosts, be it programs or bootable media; and finally for vandalism or other mayhem).
This is first answer - In Layer 2 it is easy to guess address of neighborhood machines. (192.168.0.x, 192.168.0.x+1 ... )
And think of this with simple viewpoint. There is no magic involved. Virus is a computer program. In order to connect to different computer in the network these conditions should be TRUE:
Why is it easy - imagine Level 2 network with 200 uninfected Windows computers and 1 infected Windows computer (Assume virus spreads around via port 139 and/or 445). Virus will spread around very fast if these ports are open (they are open by default).
By its definition, a virus doesn't spread (directly) from one machine to the next. Worms spread from one machine to the next through different means, either directly by exploiting some vulnerability in the target or by tricking the user to start them.
What made it easy for virus to spread around here? Assumption (or knowing) that there are Windows computers around in the same subnet. I am not Windows guru, but I still remember there is such things as Windows Network Neighborhood - you open it and you see Windows computers in same workgroup. You just need to register your machine and all computers in the same workgroup will know about existence of your computer. So virus, probably can take advantage of this auto discovery future and just get list of computers which are around. After that virus just infects those computers.
Now imagine two subnets. Without additional configuration computers there can not be part of same Workgroup. So, virus can not obtain list of computers on different subnet. It does not know where to go. It can not infect them without connecting to them. It is like you can not give me a box if you do not know my location.
So, what happens here? Infected machine is able to communicate to all computers in the subnet and check if port 139 is open. Virus finds machine with open port 139 and after that it goes on this computer. Now two of them will do same thing with next computer until all of them will be infected.
