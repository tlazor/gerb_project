You can read more about this here but at the very least this will return the DatabaseName column so you can sanity check that the database you're trying to restore is in fact the one you are intending to restore. Also learning the RESTORE DATABASE command in general will give you a much better way to show us what you're trying to do, since unless you record a video and post it, it is difficult for us to understand what you are pointing and clicking at before you get this error.
The message usually means that you're trying to restore a backup of another - unrelated - database over your existing database. Double check that the backup you're restoring is really of the database you think it is.
Edit: If I remember correctly, you can also get this message if you're trying to restore a differential backup without first restoring the correct full backup.
When using the GUI, you have to specify "" to enable over writing of a database with a backup from another database. See "Using the REPLACE option" on MSDN
