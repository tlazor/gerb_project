These solutions seem strange to me that I would have change the security group every single time. Is this just normal? Or is there some other way? 
I have the security group and the two solutions I can think of is change the inbound to everywhere or find the public ip that my laptop has and setting that as the temporary inbound. 
Also when SSHing in a public place should I  look into setting up a virtual private network or would that be over kill?
SSH is encrypted, so there's no need to double encrypt by using a VPN. Even if someone's snooping on the traffic they can't get access. Make sure you authenticate using public key, which is the default in AWS Amazon Linux instances, but may take a bit more work on other distributions.
I have recently been learning about how to set up and run a Linux server on Amazon and I have been wondering about the best practice for SSH into it from a public place. By public place I mean like a coffee shop.
If you plan to SSH in from various locations the best bet is to close it by default, add your regular IPs, and if you need access from a coffee shop log into the web interface (which you should be using 2FA for) and allow access from that IP. Don't forget to turn it off later. Leaving SSH open to the world probably isn't a huge risk, but I don't do it myself, because I don't ssh in from random locations. If your server is critical / sensitive I would be careful, but for other things the risk is probably low to moderate. Of course you need backups of data, EBS snapshots are sufficient.
