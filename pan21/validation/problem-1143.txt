No, that's just the maximum rated supply.  The amount of power drawn is actually variable.  You can observe this by plugging the machine into this device and watching it in real-time.  I know you don't want to buy it, but believe me, after you use it, it'll pay for itself in less than a year.
If you are purchasing a separate power supply and looking for a more efficient one look for the 80 Plus logo on the power supply.
The 80 PLUS performance specification requires multi-output power supplies in computers and servers to be 80% or greater energy efficient at 20%, 50% and 100% of rated load with a true power factor of 0.9 or greater. This makes an 80 PLUS certified power supply substantially more efficient than typical power supplies and creates a unique market differentiation opportunity for power supply and computer manufacturers.
Just buy a power meter.. they cost 20 bucks and are always good to have around.. or borrow one from your neighbor, work, parents, friends etc..
Does a 500 watt power supply always pull 500 watts? Or does it depend on the load being placed on the computer?
It's a n00b hardware question. I'm trying to figure out how much it costs to run my compuer without buying a meter that actually measures power usage.
No it doesn't. It just uses the power it needs plus a little overhead so the voltage doesn't go down if you plug something in there...
Internal power supplies: 80% minimum efficiency at 20%, 50%, and 100% of rated output and minimum Power Factor 0.9
