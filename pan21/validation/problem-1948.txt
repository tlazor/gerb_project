If you're using an odd drive or you're working with arrays that can't be easily partitioned like that you can try other approaches like buying the same drive from different vendors, or if you're buying in bulk you can look through and try to separate the drives based on likelihood of being manufactured together.
If we than become REALLY paranoid, get 2x of what ever storage solution you are running, based on how sensitive your organisation are to a storage breakdown this could be cheaper, this is not only a option for fortune 500 companies.
Honest answer from someone that's spent a lot of time dealing with dying raid arrays and difficult drives: Don't have all your drives from the same batch if you can avoid it.
I would recommend regardless of how you purchase the drives that you backup regularly and purchase adequate hot/cold spares for your array size and RAID type.
Based on who you are, where you are and what you do their would be different solutions to best work for you.
If you consider doing multiple orders, no set standard is applicable across the board. People recommending 2 - 4 purchasing tiers should ask themselves, if one entire tier of drives fail, will the array still be online? So for redundancy RAID levels like 1/5/10/50 you would have to buy drives 1 at a time. For RAID6 you could purchase 2 at a time.
As far as i know the quality checking of disk storage at the factory is pretty high, and i personally would not be afraid of a hardware failure in bulk due to manufacturing reasons.
Exactly the best way to handle things depends mostly on how big the array you're working with is, if you're working with something like 6 drive arrays with 2 drive redundancy you can probably safely buy similar drives from 3 manufacturers and split the array like that.
My experience only applies to spinning disks, SSDs have their own issues and benefits to consider when bulk ordering.
Storage is so cheap, that it does not make sense as a company to NOT buy in bulk, and you will within the company also write off the storage after a couple of years so the investment is not that great. The time it takes to purchase from individual vendors probably cost more due to time spent.
And we can also talk about off loading data we dont need here and now, such as (random example) years of historical financial data to "cloud" vendors that we first encrypt. This will remove storage needs from our own storage that will free us up either financially or functionally.
If you're running a small enough array with the right underlying tech it might even be worth your time to build it incrementally from heterogeneous disk supplies.  Start with the minimum number of drives you can get away with and buy the next supply a month or two later, or when you fill the system.  That also let's you get a feel for any issues that there might be with the particular models you picked.
Hard drives are almost never supplied in retail packaging. If you buy them one at a time they will almost certainly be repacked by the seller. I have found this repackaging to by highly variable. Sometimes you get a nice box with plenty of padding but other times you get hardly any padding at all.
For some context on how wildly the longevity of drives varies, Backblaze do a regular drive failure stat report... I'm not affiliated with the company in any way but they should know what they're talking about on the subject of drive reliability.  An example is https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-failure-rates-q1-2017/ ... your sample set will likely be smaller, so outlying data can mess up your own experience, it's still a good reference.
A smaller box is also more vulnerable to being tossed around by carriers without obvious outward damage. 
And if i were slightly paranoid i would just buy storage from two different manufactures that i know dont share factories, through the same vendor.
If you are trying to mitigate the "bad batch" scenario, which means every drive in a particular purchase batch can/will fail near the same time, it is also important to consider the size of the array, and the RAID level being used.
If you still are afraid of disk failure in bulk, buy more than you need. if you know you need 12 disks, than buy 5 to 7 in spare. That would only be $48 times 5 to 7, per terabyte, and we can still go cheaper without making our system unstable or unsafe because if discount in bulk or second hand disks (why is safe). Than we talk of resilver / re-initializing the array, now i of course have no way of knowing how large your storage solution is now, but if you spend weeks on this task than i would probably consider to reconfigure the organizational storage since this sounds (to me) more as a miss-configuration than anything else in one way or another.
