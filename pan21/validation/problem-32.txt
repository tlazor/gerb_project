In any case if you have no such management software running now, it will be a monsterous undertaking to learn, plan, deploy, and operate such systems. At even smaller size companies they can substantially improve IT responsiveness and proactive maintenance. However, they are the tools of the "Proactive IT" department, fixing things before they break. "Reactive IT" will have little use for alarms going off telling them there's a new fire to fight before the last fire is even put out.
System Center is a suite of different monitoring, configuration management, and automation tools Microsoft sells for the Windows operating system. Collectively they achieve Systems Management.
SCOM, System Center Operations Manager, is the monitoring component of that suite. SCCM, System Center Configuration Manager, handles configuration management. HP Operations Manager does essentially the same tasks as SCOM. The main benefits if you're looking at either are their integration with other products from the same company. HPOM integrates with HPIC. HPIC can also integrate with SCCM/SCOM.
