There are potential problems and complications with any of these options. The most likely complicating factor is if there are old or alternative ubuntu boot entries. It's important that you move the correct one to the top position in the boot order; if you move the wrong one, you'll end up with either no change in behavior or something non-functional booting, which would make it harder to boot. If you use efibootmgr, the BootCurrent line may help you to tell which option you should set as the default.
There are other ways to do it that are overkill. Re-installing GRUB (via Boot Repair or grub-install) should do the trick, for instance. These approaches run the risk of damaging a known-working GRUB configuration, though.
Note also that some EFIs are buggy and there are other issues that can make it difficult to get GRUB to boot reliably. You may want to check out these questions and answers on AskUbuntu if you run into such problems:
I've been having this exact problem the past few weeks. I figured it out using these options. Before doing any of these things I recommend  you to go into your BIOS/UEFI and check the boot order and make sure where grub is installed is first in order.
What I would recommend to you is install Windows 10 first. Then install ubuntu. But I know it is kinda taboo to just say "reinstall your software" so I'll offer an alternative too.
I went to the "boot list option" in my bios. Clicked on "Add Boot Option" (I am aware that this is bios specific). This gave me an option for file name, which in my case was 
I.e. what I'm saying is you may just need to locate the correct EFI file and move it to the top of your boot sequence / order.
With your current setup I would recommend you to boot into a Live Ubuntu CD/flash drive and install and run boot-repair. Click the "Recommended Repair" option and follow the instructions given. Go through it carefully and read all the commands before executing. This will override the current grub installation with a new one which should hopefully fix it.
