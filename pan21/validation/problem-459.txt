Ultimately you know what you want to log, how frequently, and how much data this is. You also know the app and whether it's multithreaded (lots of requests, and therefore competing resource for a single log file) or not. Without any detail of what you want to do/achieve, it is only possible to generalise.
In my case we have a loadbalancer which we had to monitor on a daily basis, in that case i made a sepparate log for the loadbalancer, but after we verified that everything is working as intended we moved it back to the syslog.
However it also depends what it is you're logging at how frequently. Apache, for example, has it's own logfiles due to the amount of data it creates - it makes much more sense for it to manage its own logging mechanism so syslog doesn't become a bottleneck or swamped with data.
If this is an app you're writing or at least can influence, then use syslog and consider having the facility you log under configurable, this way an admin can choose to log to one of the standard facilities, or use one of the local facilities (i.e, those that are local0 thru' local9) which, through the magic of syslog.conf, can be sent to a different file (local0.debug   /var/log/myapp.log).
Iny my opinion everything belongs to the syslog, if however you have some logs which you regularly have to keep an eye on, or get some reports out of it, i would advise to write them to its own logfile.
Using syslog also means you can take advantage of remote logging if you want to send log messages from many servers running the same software to a single logging server.
We syslog to Splunk, it gets expensive but it means we have so much more information available to us in one place, we can graph logged incidents over time, raise alerts etc. So yes, you need to syslog but how you do it is up to you.
I want to use syslog so logging is integrated and so I can direct it based on severity etc not to mention log rotate, but at the same time I like the idea of having a dedicated log file for my application so if there are issues you can easily see info pertaining to just the application without having to do any filtering. Logging to both a dedicated file and syslog seems redundant. Can someone please convince me to use one or the other, or both.
