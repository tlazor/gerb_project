Why no? Because Microsoft always wanted to create their own technologies and products. That's the essence of business, not just something that only Microsoft would do. Businesses not only create new products, but also try to create better products (make competition for others) and they also try to create products which would improve their current products. If they create something better than there already exists in the market, they get some share of it. But as for BitLocker, I believe that the best explanation is BUNDLING (microeconomics/marketing term). They offer products such as BitLocker with Windows OS or MS Outlook with MS Office for no additional cost for the producer (MS). The idea here is that by providing more services and more functions with same product (Windows), they become more competitive with their Windows OS and it also becomes relatively a better product. That's the microeconomics perspective.
No, BitLocker is supported only by Microsoft Windows operating systems, excluding Windows Mobile and older than Windows Vista OS.
Another big reason for using BitLocker is LEGAL: most other products would require users to agree with their license if not add additional cost for the manufacturer (i. e. while installing Windows you would have to accept to Windows EULA, but also to, for example, TrueCrypt license). Also, most licenses prohibit implementing them for commercial use, so it complicates things even more. In the end of the day, relaying on others' products is not good for the Microsoft's brand.
In conclusion, Microsoft created BitLocker purely for business reasons so not keep Microsoft Windows competitive. A perfect example would be Internet Explorer, which they created for the same reason, but recently have been punished (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling#United_States_v._Microsoft).
The answer is "No, you won't be able to access a disk encrypted by Bitlocker on other OS than Windows7 and up". Why? This is speculative and can't be answered for sure, a quick shot is just "why should Microsoft support other OS for something that is usually bound to the machine itself?".
The only way you could access those encrypted drives is by sharing them via SMB/CIFS (implemented as "file sharing services" in Windows) or other file sharing protocols (FTP, HTTP, etc.).
