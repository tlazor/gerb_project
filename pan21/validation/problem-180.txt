Your computer will connect to the router and from the router it will create a encrypted tunnel to your destination network.
To add to what's said, there's no way a VPN client could hide your public IP enroute to the VPN server, as that would literally break the Internet. One assumption made is that a device will be able to talk to another device using its IP address.
Now, what I find confusing is, does my VPN client hide my public IP (computer's) on the way to the VPN server?  I ask because I understand that this traffic would still be going out jumping through different servers until it reaches the VPN server. 
So this is what I do understand: My computer has a public IP address given by a modem/router.  (I'm using a hotspot).  And so when using a VPN it doesn't change the IP address, but rather encrypts the data and sends it to the VPN Server which then re-transmits the information using it's own IP address, thereby "hiding" my computer's public IP.  
If anybody were sniffing on these in-between server(s) before it hits the VPN server, they could pick up my computer's public IP address and then ping/log or attempt to use my public IP in nefarious ways.  Or in my case, constantly hit my modem/hotspot with a bunch of UDP traffic and cause my computer/modem to respond back with more UDP and cause my data usage to go up tremendously (even while the computer sits idle with nothing going on than contacting a server every 3 mins).
If your concerns extend beyond that, unless you have a specific named threat in mind, I'd say they're likely to be in the wrong place. Yes, someone can see that you're talking to a VPN server. But they'd have to then break into the VPN provider to identify what traffic is yours. Focus on finding a VPN provider you trust.
What the VPN does is make it so the public IP the rest of the world sees is the one the VPN server assigns you. It also generally (virtually all VPNs are encrypted) protects anyone between you and the VPN server from seeing WHAT your traffic is as the tunnel is, typically, encrypted.
