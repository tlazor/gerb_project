You can always replicate the SAN data indeed but considering the price and specs of SAN boxes, there are highly available to themselves. This is only true if you actually get a decent SAN obviously.
Because Win2k8 Storage Server is not a 'dual' controller, cache coherent SAN device, a secondary system would be needed to provide redundancy.  I don't know if Win2k8 Storage Server offers any built in cluster features that could accomplish this or if a product like Double-Take would better accomplish the end goal.
Take a look at the LeftHand SAN solutions from HP (formerly from LeftHand Networks). They provide a highly available iSCSI SAN product. We've been using it for nearly 2 years as a block storage for everything in our office. Works very well and the HA failover generally works as advertised, provided your initiator is good.
I couldn't find my favourite link explaining it, but Google went one better: IBM's redbook on SAN redundancy.
This does not mean that your disks become more reliable though... Always use some sort of RAID technology to protect (i.e. not RAID0) your data accross disks.
Typically you don't replicate the entire SAN - you replicate the switch to provide an alternative router to the disk arrays, and ensure the disks are in a RAID configuration.
