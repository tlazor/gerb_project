AH HA! I was having this problem also, and I believe I have found a work around. In the short period of time you can stay logged on go into the options menu and turn OFF as in UNCHECK the "Sign me out of all other places when I sign into Messenger" option and make sure that the "Show me all the other places I'm signed in at when I sign in" option is CHECKED. Hit apply and just let it log you out again like it always does. Then, the next time you try to log in you will get a popup with a list of all the places you are signed in, with the option to sign out of each of these place. Use this to sign out on your other computer(s). This seems to acctually sign you out at the other places correctly so that you may remain logged in at the current computer.
You could just install a free software like logmein.com and remote to it, logout and than login anywhere else you wanted to. I don't know if there is a setting that will auto logout anywhere else once you login from another place.
Where system specifies the remote machine's name or IP to connect to. You will need to allow it in your firewall. If you don't want to bother with firewall rules or there is a router at the office you can't access, consider leaving Teamviewer running so you can quickly login and disable it yourself remotely. Teamviewer does not require additional router configurations from experience.
