From here it's about replacing lines of code with the updated sub procedure calls. The population of information now resides in its own sub, and its name describes what it's doing.
You are looping without the need to do so. If I've understood your example you can replace your loo For i = 11 to final ... Next with what follows below. Since you're looking at each row in column 2 to see if it matches what's in the combobox you can do that directly without looping.
Your main macro now shows a higher level view without showing all the details. You can certainly move things around and add error handling. Please note that On Error Resume Next will plow through any errors that arise, and I've removed its use.
You've already a comment about reducing your code. If you ignore the first group that's populating on row 19 they all follow a pattern for the row and column population. I came up with the two functions below that return the same information. Using the generic name userNumber you supply it as an argument to the function in return you'll get the row and first column that are used for population.
You can now replace the population of users 2-14 with a single sub that takes in the userNumber and will populate the information.
