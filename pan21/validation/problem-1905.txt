Everything seems to be working pretty good, but I would like to be able to secure the access to the staging server. So, unless it is the right person, someone trying to enter stage.domainX.com should be disallowed (and, if possible, go to the production server).
P.S. I've actually wanted to manage this through ports, but I haven't figured out a way to do it. Like, domainX.com:80 (standard) goes to production and domainX.com:9000 goes to staging. Haven't found a way to do this in DNS though (using GoDaddy's nameservers/zones).
Is there a good way to handle this? Or, am I handling the staging domain name process in an unusual way?
And, I wanted to use a domain name instead of an IP because I want the clients to be able to more friendly view the staging site (instead of memorizing an IP address).
I have a staging server and production server that hosts multiple sites (using Apache2.2). Currently, I have the DNS pointing stage.domainX.com to the staging server and *.domainX.com pointing to the production server.
