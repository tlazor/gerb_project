RAID disk sets are managed by each controller in its own way; if you don't have the same controllers to which those disks were attached, you won't be able to recover anything from them. You can't, say, move disks from a IBM ServeRAID controller to a HP Smart Array one and expect to use them without wiping them out and re-creating the array.
If you instead want to put the disks back in their original servers, things might be more easy: most controllers can tell you "I expected to find disks A, B and C but now I only have A and it's in slot 3 instead of slot 1", so you can go from there. But this, again, depends a lot on the specific controller models you have.
If you manage to find out the controller models and acquire similar ones, then what you can do depends on the controllers: some of them can recover the RAID configuration from the disks (useful if you have to replace a broken controller), while some of them can't. Of course, you would still need to group the disks in their original sets and, probably, place them in the same position; but if they're unmarked, you're quite out of luck here.
