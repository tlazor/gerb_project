To sum it all up, If I were a teacher I'd ask my students to start learning Game Programming without a framework.Using an SDK is recommended though.Flex SDK is useful if you were thinking of programming in FlashDevelop IDE or other Flash IDEs. 
If you care more about how the whole thing works, plus love getting your hands dirty with all the behind the scenes stuff, then start from scratch and learn about it all as you go.
If you first and foremost want to makes games, then by all means use a framework to do all the other stuff you don't care about too much at the moment. You'll get yourself up and running much faster and you'll have something on the screen quickly. You can worry about how all the other stuff happens another day when that becomes interesting.
Since you have a lot of programming experiences i could recommend you using one of the frameworks that are avaible, i have some tutorials and a template for flixel in my blog, maybe you should take a look at them. 
If you are into game programming in Flash, then a framework would give you more power over functionalities. But these frameworks are not easy to work with, and you'll have to play around with them for quite some time before you can finally use them. So I'd recommend to first understand the basics of Flash and ActionScript and how they work before you think about using a framework.
I'd recommend you to start without any framework like flixel, flashpunk or even Box2d. They do really make life simpler to you by keeping in mind the ancient programmer philosophy "Don't always reinvent the wheel" 
I'm not a Flash/ActionScript developer, but as this is a hobby, what is do you want to work on most?
