Open the Network and Sharing Center. Click on Change Adapter Settings. Right click on whichever connection you are using and click Properties. Uncheck the box for AppEx Networks Accelerator. It is not even present in Windows 7/8 32 bit...
Unchecking AppEx worked for me using Windows 10 Home Premium. File transfer in Filezilla accelerated to over 10X faster speed before it ran out of file to transfer.   Was at around 10kbps.
Check link speed and duplex under the network adapter settings.  Change to auto negotiation if anything else is selected.  This took me 6+ hours of troubleshooting.  This site finally had me looking in the right place.
The following settings worked for me after a couple of configurations and tests. I tested both small files and big files. I also tested extracting a zip file (SysinternalSuite.zip) directly on the File Server. It definitely seems to be a driver issue. Last but not least, I unplugged my network cable from my Thunderbolt 27" Display, which also made a huge difference in performance. Seems like my Apple setup doesn't like the Windows Kernel...
