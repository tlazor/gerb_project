I have a local AD server with DNS installed called (adserver.mydomain.local)  To allow trust relationships with other domains we have configured a number of conditional forwards to remote AD servers.  All of these work fine except for one: it forwards most requests correctly but when it receives a request for ._msdcs.remote.domain it rejects it without trying to contact the remote server, even after clearing the DNS servers cache.  This problem started after the AD servers at the remote location were replaced.  This DNS issue causes lookups for the  _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.remote.domain SRV record to fail, which prevents the AD trust from working correctly as the local servers can find a login server for remote.domain.
As a quick & dirty workaround you might consider either doing a zone transfer for remote.domain or configuring a stub zone. 
If I perform an nslookup directly to the remote.domain DNS servers it works correctly, this problem is only seen when the request is passed through the conditional forwarder. This affects both a windows 2003 and a windows 2008 AD server on the local domain.
Why would the DNs server do this for any addess under _msdcs.remote.domain, and how can I fix it?  The conditional forwarders for all other domains are working correctly, it's only this one that is causeing problems. _msdcs.remote.domain
The message using nslookup is "adserver.mydomain.local can't find _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.remote.domain: Query refused"
Is your forwarder a Microsoft DNS server installation or another vendor's DNS server? Do you happen to have a zone named remote.domain on this server? Where did you take your caps? Is the forwarding configuration still correct in regards to destination domain's DNS server addresses?
