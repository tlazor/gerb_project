I assume you've done the basic troubleshooting steps of restarting OMSA (service dataeng restart) and making sure IPMI is loaded:
You can run ipcs -s to list all of the semaphores currently allocated on your system and then use ipcrm -s <id> to remove a semaphore (if you're reasonably sure it's no longer needed).  You might also want to track down the program that created them (using information from ipcs -s -i <id>) to make sure it's not leaking semaphores.  In my experience, though, most leaks come from programs that were interrupted (by segfaults or similar) before they could run their cleanup code.
If your system really needs all of the semaphores currently allocated, you can increase the number of semaphores available.  Run sysctl -a | grep kernel.sem to see what the current settings are.  The final number is the number of semaphores available on the system (normally 128).  Copy that line into /etc/sysctl.conf, change the final number to a larger value, save it, and run sysctl -p to load the new settings.
One common non-obvious cause of this problem is system semaphore exhaustion.  Check your system logs; if you see something like this:
