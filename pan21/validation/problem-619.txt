I had to document the servers i use and i don't know what to use to hold the data. Could you sugest the best way to keep the server documentation? Do i create a data base that holds the harware and software documentation, or do i use wiki pages or SVN? Or if ther is a tool that holds the documentation could you please provide the link.
Folders with spreadsheets with info on each server, docs/pdfs of user manuals, contact info for OEMs/VARs/Support, etc.
Then get something like dropbox/sugarsync/etc. and make sure you are syncing it all to the web so that anything you update gets replicated.  You'll like this in a DR situation.
Don't use office suits for documentation, such as OpenOffice or Word since they store their data in their own formats, such as .doc or .odt. This can be very painful when you switch to another documentation system later.
The best way I have seen so far is either using a Wiki or a combination of a CRM (we use Sugar CRM) and the file system. I prefer Wiki systems when they have a versioning and user management system. This allows easy collaboration, you can do almost everything and you are free in the way you organize yourself.
On the open source side of things, dedicated for keeping documentation on computers, software, printers (and how did it change with time) is GLPI.
SVN is not a bad way for holding your data, but has disadvantages when you want to allow other users to access your data. Furthermore you need to do svn updates, checkouts etc. all the time. This can be annoying (I have SVN documentation repositories myself..).
For additional features, there's also a knowledge base, system to track which computers are connected where (on the network level). It has included ticket system for reporting/solving problems and help desk.
I can also advice you not to store your documentation in .txt files. Although they are easy to handle (can be moved without high efforts, can be searched etc), this is a very inefficient way to organize your stuff. Especially when you want to embed images or videos into your documents.
Well, I don't know what your specific requirements are in detail, but I can advice you what to avoid (based on my personal experience).
