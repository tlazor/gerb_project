Is there a way out there, whether through configuration of windows server 2008 or third party software to monitor a computer?
PSTools, specifically PSLoggedOn can do this on a machine by machine basis.  Wrap it around some more code in a language you know and you will be off to the races.
It's also possible to easily script something like this for Active Directory, which keeps all the information you've asked for stored in it.
I am guessing there will be something installed on each machine and relays status back to a centralized location. But would be great if its all web base, where i can log in and see all that.
You could turn on the SNMP client software. Then monitor it through one of them many free or pay products available. 
Say, I have a computer on my network named WORKSATION01. I want to have a status that tells me its currently on/off, if someone has logged on to that computer and who, if the account is idle, locked, etc.
In short, yes, there are ways to get that information, and some applications can provide web-based insight into it, but the configuration of your network (AD, OSes, etc) weighs heavily on possible configurations.
