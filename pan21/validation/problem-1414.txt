Also with the new lead-free solders, surface mount chips, the high tin content can lead to problems under extreme cold. It actually deteriorates. We had the cold pop a few chips on one of our HP printers controller causing it to be warrantied. The service tech told us that it was due to the lead-free solder having less flexibility.
Computers should generally function very well in low temperature environments, but when there is moisture in the air, and that moisture builds up as ice or condensation on the computer due to the temperature differential between the computer components and the surrounding air, the computer will be at high risk for electrical failure.
Note: There should be no risk of humidity as long as your PC's temperature is ca 4 degrees above environment's one.
Low temperatures themselves are not a problem, it is when they are combined with humidity that you'll start to have issues.
The hard drives "breathe" more under these conditions if the drive is allowed to go through warming and cooling cycles. In the Pacific Northwest you can end up with moisture condensing out inside the drive housing. We keep computers running 24/7 inside a cabinet where they can keep it relatively warm. Lower temperatures hopefully alleviate this kind of thing with less moisture being in the air. 
If you put that computer inside a small box (cardboard would be fine) for the winter, and never shut it off, it should be fine.  The biggest issue you'll run into is solder joints breaking from repeated heating/cooling, which won't be an issue if you leave the computer on.  The box should keep it at a reasonable operating temperature.
