I agree with JustAnAnonUser_13249 that the answer is old, however none of the answers covers it enough.
Your friend is a poor techie. Unless you have more than 3GB of RAM, there's no reason to use 64bit, and your processor will handle 32bit just as well - there's no rule saying 32bit processors are better at 32bit tasks.
First of, vista 32 bit will run just as fast on a 32 bit processor as on a 64 bit processor (in 32 bit mode). There is no performance loss here.
Trying to use a 64 bit browser and 32 bit java or the other way around o.t.o.h. is all sorts of fun.
Also, consider that nearly every OS is multi-arch (both lib and lib32) so 32bit software works fine without a significant performance hit. 64bit software cannot run on a 32bit system, but 32bit software can on a 64bit system (provided the developers aren't like the PCSX2 team who expect the package maintainers to create their own 64bit fork or put up with it being 32bit-only /rant). Anyway, for better or worse, it's a consideration.
Everyone here mentioned the advantage of 62bit systems as being able to use more than 4GiB RAM. Since PAE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAE) was introduced into most kernels, 32bit system can handle more RAM just fine. I'm also advising anyone stumbling on this question that 32bit x86 is not "maintained" as well these days (ala 2015+). There's a lot of software that's written for AMD64 only. I think Ubuntu dropped 32bit last LTS, and Debian is one of the few that still supports it (because Debian supports even dead/dying platforms -- which 32bit x86 is.)
I suspect you are not longer going to read this, but in case anyone hits this answer: Google this site. There are dozens of variations on this question.
The Take Home: The situation is in reverse now. 64bit x86 is de facto now and 32bit will become deprecated. While PAE allows 32bit machines to use more than 4GiB RAM, it's advisable you use an AMD64 (x86_64, 64bit) OS because your 32bit stuff will still run just fine, but so will 64bit stuff.
*A tiny increase, to be sure, but it's potentially DOUBLE the ram usage! In actuality it's barely perceptible, but he's not dealing in fact either :P
I know this question is old but the answer needs updating. The short answer is rather use an AMD64 (x86_64 or 64bit).
If you have more than 4GB of RAM, you should definitely be on 64bit, however, as a 32bit OS will only give you ~3.5gb to play around with out of that. Else, feel free to laugh right back as he faces slightly increased RAM usage from having 64bit pointers* instead of 32bit pointers, with no upside! (unless he has more than 4GB himself)
What your friend probably tried to say is “Why not use windows vista 64 bits and take advantage of the 64 bit CPU in your laptop?”.
32-bit OS'es, in addition to not being able to use efficiently more than 4GiB of RAM, also can not efficiently mmap() files larger than 4GiB.  This last part comes up more often than you'd think.
