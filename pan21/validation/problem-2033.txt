Any good advice in general in trying these things? I intend to do it virtually since I don't have heaps of spare hardware, but that shouldn't be an issue, right?
We're planning to migrate from SBS 2003 to 2011 in a month or so, and I want to try out the upgrade process before I do it on the real server. I haven't bought the 2011 licence yet, but noticed that there is a trial version at Technet. Is the trial version complete enough to try out a migration? 
I also don't have a spare 2003 licence, is there a trial version of 2003 still availible? And in that case, is it upgradeable? If not, any other way of trying it out? I suppose I could use the existing licence, but that isn't really ok, is it? I'm not good enough at legalese to understand the EULAs, maybe it is considered fair use (if there is such a thing)?
Your technet editions of SBS are identical to the fully purchased legal versions, so they should be exactly the same as if you had purchased them off the shelf. The only difference is their license agreement.,
