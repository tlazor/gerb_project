I just had this problem (why I found this thread) and I was able to fix it by pushing the c, e, and d button at the same time and hold them down for a few seconds.  I have no idea what caused it why this fixed but might be worth a shot.
Just had this problem. Luckily, the solution was simple. I popped out the offending keys using a delicately placed pencil. I then spotted a hair and removed it. Popped the keys back in and voila - good as new.
What I did was simply remove the keyboard (look how to do it for your computer on youtube) and then I disconnected the keyboard from the MB, cleaned both - the cable and the slot for it - and there it was a hair! After reconnecting it, everything worked out just as before. 
Itâ€™s a Common problem you can easily solve. Just remove your key board ribbon cable from the mother board slot and clean it. That will solve your problem. I just did in my Acer Aspire V laptop.
I know it's just 6 years later, but I had that same problem 3 (+4) E D C didn't work. I fixed it. The problem was in the connection to the motherboard. I got my notebook cleaned "proffessionaly":D and after recieving it the problem with the keypads started.
