So basically you grab all the 20226 and 20227 events, and then, from that list, reject the 20226 results with an error of 631
I did however come up with an answer that finds all events with an EventID of 20226 (RAS Connection Termination) or an EventID of 20227 (RAS Connection failed on Connection)
This works well since there are about 150 error codes associated with rasClient (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/163111) and the only one I don’t want to initiate a restart is when I disconnect the connection (631).
I disagree with Owen’s answer above because using the "not equal to" (!=) command does not seem to work when comparing a value to a EventData element. The query returned zero results.
The trick is to then suppress those results that have an EventID=20226 with a data element of 631 (The port was disconnected by user)
It is not a “perfect” solution as it does rely on storing your VPN UserID and Password in plain text, but I figure if someone has reached that deep into my computer, I have bigger troubles then worrying about one VPN password.
Here is the query I came up with. Testing it in the event viewer; it seems to meet all the necessary criteria.
