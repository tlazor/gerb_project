The LACP protocol involves a hash which can be an L2 hash, or L3 hash or even L4 hash (i.e. looking into the TCP/UDP port numbers) and this hash (by design) prevents a single session spanning more than a single physical interface. Thus, one single iSCSI session to one target across LACP will only give you the speed of one interface, at best.
Newer versions of Linux open-iscsi have the extra feature, so I would guess Xenserver will also get this too at some stage.
It is possible to open multiple sessions between a single initiator and a single target on a given IP address, and if this travels across an LACP bonded connection there are reasons why you might want to. Sadly, not all combinations of initiator and target will support this. In my testing with Citrix XenServer 6.2 (the installer that can be freely downloaded, not any enhanced version) my observation has been that when Multipath IO is enabled, it opens exactly one session to each IP address it can find. Thus, if you want multiple paths you need to setup multiple IP addresses on multiple interfaces.
