ISC DHCP can be configured to answer everything you need for PXE booting, without resorting to a DHCP Proxy server setup. The only reason you'd really want a DHCP Proxy server is if you didn't want, or couldn't have, control over the configuration of the DHCP server that responds.
So for me it is not clear why you need your own server. DHCP and PXEBOOT is a very tricky thing. With DHCP Proxy you add a bunch of additional problems. Because the documents are vague and the implementations on the client side terrible, which implies much testing and byte inspecting on the wire.
DHCP Proxy was set up explicitly to enable a means of having another service, even on another machine, completely divorced from any control or manipulation of the DHCP server. The PXE specification enables the client to basically listen for two responses - one from the DHCP server, and one from the Proxy, to assemble everything it needs to bootstrap down the NBP (network boot program).
I'm not currently aware of any open source DHCP Proxy service implementations, but honestly the code for that portion of the protocol is incredibly simple.
The specificiation from Intel at http://download.intel.com/design/archives/wfm/downloads/pxespec.pdf is extremely detailed in this respect, and illuminates the sequences very clearly. Check out pages 15 through 19 for the details. The RFC's include this same information, but to me it wasn't nearly as clear.
