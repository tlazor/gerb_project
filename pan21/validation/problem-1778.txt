The first time you log in with a user a profile is created for them under C:\Users The profile for each user is simply a folder in this directory with their username.  If you are using the same user names the new folder will be called "username"."yourdomain".  So all you have to do is move all the important files from the old profile to the new profile.  Now technically you could just do a select all and move literally all the files from one profile to the other, but I would not suggest it as there are system files that can make things a bit wonky if they don't move correctly.
Most of the good stuff will be in the folders Documents, Favorites (assuming you run IE), Pictures, Video, Music and AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook (Appdata is hidden by default) if you have outlook with .PSTs 
Using a move operation in Windows 7 as opposed to a copy is much faster if you are moving between locations on the same hard disk.
The problem with this method is it involves a copy and depending on how much data they have that can take a while.  So what's the fastest way to do it?
