You can use the Windows 7 upgrade trick to install Windows 7 without a clean install disk: http://www.pcworld.com/article/174288/windows_7_upgrade_made_cheaper.html
Older versions of Windows allowed you to insert the old CD into the drive; Vista/7 don't allow you to do this. You need a copy of Windows already installed on the drive before upgrading. Of course, you can wipe the drive after it validates and allows you to start partitioning. (Just don't restart!)
Basically, install Windows with the Upgrade disk (don't worry if it doesn't validate), use slmgr -rearm to rearm the system (making it look like it's validated for up to 120 days (which is why this is not a permanent solution)) then install Windows AGAIN from the upgrade disk. It should recognize the "upgrade" install, and allow you to install a permanently validated version.
We have a laptop that has an OEM copy of Windows Vista.  Somehow the OS got corrupted and the only restore option is a recovery partition that also seems to be corrupted.  We have verified that the hardware is fine, and the problem is purely software.
You can't do a fresh install with a Win7 Upgrade license (the name said it all). You will need a full license to install from scratch.
The following method is similar to Hello71's reply above, but doesn't require the second install of Windows 7, so it should be much faster.
In short, it depends on how corrupted the install is. Nobody really knows what Microsoft checks in its upgrade process; it's a secret.
Warning: IANAL, this is likely against Microsoft's EULA, but I consider it ethical if the OEM install is corrupted and will not install normally (always try the definitely legal way first ;)).
If we buy a Windows 7 Upgrade license, can we do a fresh install without a working Vista install?  How does the upgrade know if I have a copy of Vista?
