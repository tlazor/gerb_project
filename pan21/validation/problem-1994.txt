Upon restart (finger on the power button type), the usual "why did your server unexpectedly shutdown" messages occur; however, the event logs shows no indication of what might have caused this. The events simply stop and restart at the point at which the power is back on. There are no indications of Blue Screening, nothing. The server is in a locked room with limited RDP access.
Is this a domain controller that holds all FSMO ROLES. I know thst SBS2003 will restart or shutdown if you have not moved all the FSMO ROLES to it and have another domain controller holding them on the network.
I have seen this once before, but i doubt this is the issue. In the past I have had HP servers that have exhibited this behaviour when overheating. But im sure you would have noticed the room being hot.
Unfortunately, having experienced this hasn't translated into any idea of why this happens, beyond the usual suspects (power loss, unlogged hardware fault, the helldesk guys messing with me, etc.).  Could be a lot of things, and without any useful information in the logs, you'll never be able to say for sure what the cause was, or even have anything better than an educated guess at the possibilities.
In the past 24 hours our Windows SBS 2003 server has twice experienced an unexpected shutdown, resulting in the server going into a power off/standby state - not an OS standby.
I realise that I have only supplied limited info but has anyone ever experienced anything like this?
