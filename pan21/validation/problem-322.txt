I've a windows 10 copy running in my core i5 second gen laptop. Now there is this issue where the hard disk usage goes to 100% and the system doesn't respond for a few seconds to even few minutes. I've run process monitor, resource monitor and found that the system uses the disk so much. This doesn't happen when the pc is on idle rather, if I open a folder or any other window, the hard disk usage spikes to 100% and be there for a long time! which is unusual.

I couldn't find what is wrong with the system. I use bitdefender 2015 antivirus and tried switching it off. Then again I disabled windows search, indexing service and all possible solutions I could find over the internet. Installed Ccleaner and did a registry clean and a system cleanup. Nothing worked and now the system is unusable! I cannot re - install windows since I don't have most of the software I've already installed.
