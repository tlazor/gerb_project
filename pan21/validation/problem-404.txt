Given an extensionless filename it will list the order in which the various executable file types (as defined by the PATHEXT variable) will be found starting with the current directory and then searching the PATH sequentially for all executable types in the correct order. This search pattern is the one used by the CMD shell as far as I am aware, for commands launched by api calls such as CreateProcess the search behavior and order will be different.
You can try doing cmd /K abc and it will run but will leave the command prompt open. Hope this helps.
Have you tried Process Monitor? You could set the filter to "path contains 'abc'" and then sift through the results.
This is quick and dirty and I haven't exhaustively tested it but it handles paths with spaces and paths with\without a trailing backslash which are the most obvious complications. Odd paths with forward slashes and quoted semicolons will throw it for a loop.
Just put an ECHO command in the cmd file and you'll know quickly enough.  Might not be what you want for long term, but it'll do for this purpose.
