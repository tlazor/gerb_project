That sounds similar to a problem I had on one of my computers running WinXP.  I traced the problem to the "Zero Configuration Wireless" service that's supposed to find and automatically connect to the wireless network with best signal strength. The problem was if signal strength varied the service would often drop the service  that was first connected and try to reconnect to another one.  In some cases it didn't work that well and the computer would simply flash a blue screen and reboot every 15 minutes or so.  I solved the problem by disabling the Zero Configuration Wireless service and instead always manually connected to wireless network I wanted.
Tried running defrag manually but it doesn't seem to do anything - just quits and I see no process running in task manager.
I'd suggest doing a BIOS update if one is available for your system.  That eventid literally means that Windows has no idea why the machine was shutdown suddenly.
I disabled the defrag task in the task scheduler (even though the history shows no sign of failure) and so far today haven't seen any reboot even though the system has been idle. Will leave for another day or two then re-enable the task and see what happens.
I have no idea if this is your problem.  But one thing to check is to see whether you get the same rebooting problem when you have your wireless network connection disabled.
