You need to have SSSD installed. I don't know which distribution you are using, but usually the package has the same name sssd.
Since filter passwd references the LDAP filter, it can be as complicated as you wish, including multiple group constraints inside a logical expression.
If this is the case, you could simply delegate this to pam_ldap, and configure it to filter the authentication at that stage instead.
You might pull this off with PAM_LDAP's configuration option pam_groupdn if you have the possibility of creating a new group, a merger between GROUP1 and GROUP2, and adding every user of GROUP1 and GROUP2 to that group, for ex. let's call it GROUP3.
As far as I know, pam_groupdn doesn't allow for more than one group. If you can't merge GROUP1 and GROUP2 into a third GROUP3 one, your other option would be to use SSSD.
In any case, if you are running LDAP, you have dynamic groups already. What you need is to feed those groups to the clients. I might be missing something, but here is a couple of options I can think of:
If I'm understanding you correctly, you are using a file to check the authentication, before you reach the LDAP plugin. And this file is connecting to an LDAP, that checks (at least) 2 groups, and allows the users belonging to (either of) those two groups to authenticate.
