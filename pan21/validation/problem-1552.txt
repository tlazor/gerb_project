Also check you are connected properly, and Windows isn't automatically applying any proxies for you. If it is, then try and apply these to the Linux install too.
On Xubuntu I have set the default browser to Chrome and Firefox. Neither will ever access the terms and conditions page.
You need to access the captive portal. Try to navigate to captive.apple.com (A generic captive portal used in Apple devices which usually redirects - just something to try first), something like Google or Yahoo, and if not, then the Utah trains website . This should ask it to go to the captive portal and then to the webpage you need.
Linux connects to the network, but never gets a notification for additional authentication. I am connected, but when I open my browser I am unable to connect to the internet because the terms and conditions window never opens. 
I have a computer dual booting Windows 10 and Xubuntu 16.04. On Windows I can connect to the WiFi and I get a notification saying that additional authentication is needed. When I click the notification a new window opens in my default browser asking me to agree to terms and conditions. I do so and I'm able to access the wifi.
I ride the train every weekday morning, and I like to work done on the train. I require the internet, and luckily the train (Utah Transit Authority Frontrunner) provides free WiFi for passengers.
