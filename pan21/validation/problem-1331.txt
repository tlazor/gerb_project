the communication with ssh protocol is secure, but i think your admins have other reasons for not granting ssh access with the first request.
so when granting ssh access, no matter how secure it is setup, you have direct access to the machine and this is another attack vector to the system. the philosophy should be to enable as few services as possible. but i can't imagine your admins are not already using ssh. so there should be no additional risk on enabling ssh, but perhaps on giving away a new account on the server. ask them whether they use public key authentication or password authentication. it is a good security advice to use public keys.
when you gain ssh access to a system, you can normally copy files to the system and execute them (not only your jars). this way, you could upload files gaining root access or compromise the system in a different way.
another reason for not granting you access, could be that they loose a bit of control over the server, because they do not know in detail what is running on the server. so tell them in detail what you want to upload and what these programs do. they might ask you some more questions or tell you you have to change something, but this way you can work together with your admins to get your jars running on the server.
I agree with Aputsiaq - if configured right, it can be safe - if not it isn't.  You'll have to monitor the server more closely, I think.  Set it as tight as you can handle.
One other reason that they might be reluctant to open ssh is it's ability to tunnel connections.  SSH typically allows tunnells which means that you have the potential to open up more of their network than they might want.
