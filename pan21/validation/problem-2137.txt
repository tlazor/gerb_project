Generic drives will work fine, you'll need the appropriate caddies, EBay or various 'Net retailers can sell you the appropriate hardware. As for the 3G/6G issues you'll be fine buying the faster disks for both servers.
Also, i'm thinking of just going 2.5" in the new server, so is there a 2.5" adapter caddy that will fit in the 3.5" chassis for the Dell, so I can use 2.5" drives in the 3.5" chassis?
I have a friend who has two servers, a Dell 1800 and an HP 350 ML G5, both have SAS drive arrays.  The Dell is a 3.5" and the HP is a 2.5".
You will need to get the caddies for each server. A bare drive won't work. You should get a 2.5 caddy for the 2.5 drive and a 3.5 caddy for the 3.5 drive. 
As for the 2.5 drive in the 3.5 scenario I've never seen those. You might just look at replacing the entire drive cage. I know for the 350 there are aftermarket options you can purchase to change it, i'm not as familiar with the Dell though.
They currently only have 3 drives in each array.  We want to add additional drives, but they do not appear to have caddies, just "fake" covers.  I haven't been able to take a good look at them, so I'm not sure what I need to do here.  Are the "sockets" just there, and I can buy additional caddies and just stick them in?  Or do I have to buy some kind of caddy adapter?
Can I buy 6GB/s drives and add them to the 3GB/s controller?  The reason is that we're going to replace both computers in a year or so, and we want to bring the drives with.  So rather than buy 3GB/s drives, we just want to buy 6GB/s drives so they can be used in the new server.
