Now that you have those lists throw them into a spreadsheet some header fields to get you started are: Product - Quantity - Unit Price - Extended Price.  Add what you need to make the spreadsheet work for you. 
While you answer to those questions you'll find that some key services or personal computer or important files are not backupped or in fault tolerance.
Firstly is this a CapX budget (hardware/software/sometimes maintainence) or an all encompassing(everything you could possibly need including salaries, travel, training, etc)  budget? 
The next step would be to make a list of must have equipment and software as well as a list of nice to have equipment and software. 
1) When you make these spreadsheets, include applicable warranties, tax, and shipping in all costs. Round up to account for price adjustments and things you forgot. 
You can't do this in a vacuum, you need to talk to the business side (CxO, managers, etc) and find what projects they have in mind for the coming year, also what at the pain points for them as far as the computer systems go. After you do that, you need to sit down and look at the infrastructure to see what needs to be updated and/or maintained.  Also make sure you catalog what maintenance renewals need to be renewed.
Then interview both bosses and users and try to make them happy allowing them to achieve their aims and daily task in a much easier and productive way: that's why you're there.
2) Know that a certain amount of your required budget items will be vetoed by someone that controls the money, knows very little about what you do/need, but you still report to him. He will take the flak if something fails because you didn't replace it in time. You need to give him enough flexibility to cut out items from your budget while still ensuring you can complete all of your goals and replace things that need to be replaced. This is a fancy way of saying "put more than you absolutely need on your initial budget because you will never get more than you ask for, and you will always get less..."
The sum of all of these is your Budget. Make sure you have your list of "Nice to haves" ready for when you bring it to the boss, it's the stuff that you just don't fight for when the knives get put to the budget. 
Think something like: "What happens if my proxy server dies tomorrow? Am I ready to replace it? In how many hours? Do I have a backup solution to allow my users to surf the internet while I put it back online?"
Now go out and get quotes on EVERYTHING - yes everything - and toss the pricing into the spreadsheet. Don't include any discounts the sales people say they can get you and ask for either a separate line item for the discount or two quotes, one discounted and one list price.  Also, be honest when they ask you your purchasing time frame just say "I'm just pulling together next years budget right now, so the best I can tell you is sometime in the coming year."
I'd just add that before opening google with a calculator in your hand look around you for delicate places where you seriously need backup and/or fault tolerance.

I am in a similar situation. One thing that I have found helpful is creating a spreadsheet every month with different priority levels for all the things you want to buy. I use: "ZOMG! MUST HAVE!!11", required ASAP, should buy soon, buy if we have money, and this is a low priority purchase. (You could rank them 1-5 if you wanted to be more professional :))
This allows you to see what types of items you buy on a monthly basis and if you put them all together over the course of the previous year, it helps to see what types of items you tend to buy on an emergency basis and what lower priority items you buy over the course of the year. If you include computers and licenses on these spreadsheets, it should aggregate nicely when you look at an entire year's worth at once.
