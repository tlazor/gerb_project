Anyway I've got key bindings working in MS Word (for emacs that is), and have to believe something similar exists but I've just started using OneNote.
 3) We'll ignore keystrokes to move to the next position, for simplicity, putting the cursor in front of the "i" character in the word being replaced.
My next step is to look for .NET or VBA control over OneNote.  That'll be the key to controlling OneNote using the key bindings you prefer (or that's my best guess).
Sure, GUI applications have shortcuts too.  You're still missing the point.  VIM's interface provides complex and flexible functionality while requiring the minimal amount of keystrokes.
Although this is true, the users that made comments pointing out this obvious fact are totally missing the point.  The point that they are missing is that there is a level of productivity and efficacy that information workers achieve when they can keep their hands on the keyboard constantly.
I tried ViEMU, but ultimately was unsatisfied.  After that I discovered VisVIM.  If I recoall, ViEMU didn't implement large portions of VIM functionality.
When you are spending 8 to 10 hours in a text editor each day the VIM style interface adds up considerably to enhance productivity.  That was a contrived example above, but you should realize that switching between files, viewing two files at once in the same GUI or shell, saving changes, and exiting the editor back to a terminal prompt (or back to the top-level app if not using a terminal)... all of these actions are done with similar minimalistic and simple key combinations.
GlobalVim has many features of vim and can work across all input situations. Registers, macro-recording, pattern replacement, and python expression evaluation...
OneNote's disgustingly obese interface and running process profile aside; M$ is generally pretty good about having standard/consistent shortcuts across all apps.  Consistency is important and so give Bill his due credit there, but consider this: what is/are the keyboard keystroke(s) required to repeat the last atomic editing action in OneNote or Word?  The minimum is one 3-key combination (highlight last word) followed by two 2-key combinations (Copy then paste).
I do know the shortcuts for OneNote, but you don't understand the level of data processing, the volume of content/text processing that even a newbie VIM user outpaces... you.
Not a very helpful answer, but seriously now people - not every application has a Vim oriented key bindings. They are a different app.
Consider a developer; fundamentally they operate within a text editor as source code is created or maintained.  Maybe a few emails are written too.  Hopefully, ample documentation for the codebase is also created and maintained.  Believe it or not, the time that it takes to move a hand from the keyboard to the mouse adds up to be significant over the course of a day.
*Assume: the word being replaced is selected as a whole (via visual mode or the "cw" sequence), then "v-o-i-d" is typed, and then...
Simply follow the instructions found in the %VIMFILEs%\README_VisVim.txt document that is installed along with the standard GVIM installation package for Windows.

What do you mean you can define a macro or complex series of steps, bind it to a key, and then execute that complex series of steps repeatedly (e.g. A VIM macro like "10 @i" would execute the macro bound/identified by the "i" key 10 times in a row).  That can be done 100, 1000, a 100,000,000 times without any trouble at all.
