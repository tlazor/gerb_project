Plesk is only really useful if yo ueither have clients who you want to be able to configure and manager their accounts, without giving them RDP access to the server (especially useful if they are not technical).
Essentially, if you know what your doing on the server, and you don't need clients to access it, then save your self some money and leave it off.
I believe the purpose of Plesk (and similar) is to give users the ability to manage much of their server while either not granting them full root/admin access and/or them needing to know how to do the same thing directly. From what you've said it certainly doesn't sound like you have a need for it at all.
Now, a few years ago I had a Plesk based VPS and I never saw any use for it. I felt Plesk was just what Remote Desktop is only with an interface I don't know, slower, less comfortable and slowing down my server. I administered the server via RDP and it worked just fine. 
It is also useful if you are trying to run a server without much technical knowledge, as you can perform most of the administrative tasks (at least hosting related ones) without needing a huge amount of knowledge of the OS you are running. That said, its not a replacement for a sysadmin, there are still plenty of things that need doing that Plesk can't do.
Did I completely miss the point? What is the benefit? I read the Wikipedia entry but it seems it's just an online-tool for something I get via RDP, too?!
