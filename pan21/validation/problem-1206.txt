The question doesn't show what exactly you've tried already, so I'll suggest looking at Revo Uninstaller and Glary Utilities.
Long answer: Most installers will have a list of requirements that the program want when it's installed. This is however not the whole truth. A program can make changes on the computer after the fact, for example when it's being run and you change a setting it can write this to the registry. You could add your own file association after the fact and this will be written to the registry.
So when an uninstaller is run, it will probably only look at the list that the installer used and remove those changes. Any other changes that the program has made after it was installed will not be removed by the uninsnstaller.
open regedit, click EDITthen FIND and type in the name of the program and click FIND NEXT. delete any entry it finds ,then hit F3 to search again, keep doing this until it doesn't find any more.
You could perhaps rectify this by running Process Monitor for example and track every change the program does to your computer when it's being run. It will however probably make the program quite impossible to use since you will have to watch Process Monitor at the same time.
Personally I use Sandboxie for checking out programs (trials etc),  I install Applications I want to try in to the Default Sandbox, play with them for a while and then if I want to keep them and are happy with the programs behaviour I re-install on the "live" system.
