Computers played music before they had VDTs. Home computers have had speakers of varying capabilities at least as far back as the Apple 2, whose speaker was no more advanced than the IBM PC's speaker.
The internal speaks used to always be pizo-buzzers; a simple speaker that can easily generate different tones. These were initially used mostly for beeping out error codes (especially when the code was related to the video or other output adapter not working), and to get the users attention (more people than you'd think don't look at the screen while typing).
Today they're generally not used much. But they're still there, largely to beep out error codes if your video card fails. Sometimes they'll be connected to the sound card, so the PC can play sounds without having external speakers connected.
The IBM compatible computer world did not have sound cards as "normal" until the mid-nineties, following the success of AdLib and SoundBlaster cards. By that point, the IBM PC platform had existed, with its internal speaker, for more than a decade.
if you read more, you can catch where they are used. and your last question will be related with type of motherboard ..but for sure, it's rarely used nowadays.
