As a (minor) workaround, how about obtaining a small 4 port USB hub to plug all your desktop items into (mouse, printer, bluetooth dongle, small stuff) and then only plugging THAT single device into your laptop.  Of course, if your devices require more than a few mW of power, you'd be better off with a powered hub.
This behavior is "by design" from Microsoft.  Items are 'tagged' as known by a combination of product/vender/serial#.  Since your printer seems to not have a serial number, windows sees it as new equipment each time.   Regardless whether the equipment in question is a flash drive, external storage, printer, camera, whatever.
I have a similar setup at work, small 4port with stuff there, always plugged into the same port on laptop when I arrive. (printer is on network).
I do this for my laptop, my mouse dongle is a teeny logitech model so stays plugged in always (since mouse travels with me!) and I have a 4port hub holding my drawing-pad, camera/phone data cable, scanner and printers.  One plug whenever I'm home, and a simple disconnect when I'm ready to leave.
