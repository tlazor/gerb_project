eBay and Craigslist are your best options unless you want to seek out local resources outside of Craigslist.

We have a couple of servers we no longer need now that we are fully hosted on a managed host (rackspace). They were purchased for over $10,000 each but we realize that over time their monetary value drops. Anyone have suggestions or experience selling these in a proper way? They are dual xeon processor 2U rack mountable with 4+GB RAM, intel boards, 6x 72GB 15,000 RPM SCSI Drives with raid controller redundant power supply. We are in Southern California area. I can be more specific on any information if there is interest. I know there is ebay and the like but these servers are like the family dog that has to be given up and we are looking for a proper home for a fair price. I will end up auctioning it off if need be in the end though. Thanks in advanced for any help!
An IT hardware reseller would be a great option also, such as www.core4solutions.com.  They have a buyback program that will pay you for your used IT hardware.
Southern CA might be better, but up here in the Great White North, it's hard to find other people to buy (or even to receive as donations) our old servers.  Every few years, we have a couple of old servers and a few old PCs, and I've never found a good way to dispose of them other than disposing of them.  The times I have been able to sell surplus equipment, I've used Craigslist.
