The right answer really depends on what you want to do next.  If you move on to something new you may risk finding yourself solving the same old problems all over again and not really extending your skills, but you do get to move on to something new.  If you continue to polish there are useful things to learn from the brief list you gave, and they will stand you good in the future, but you're still working on the same old codebase.
What I'd recommend, and this is a purely personal opinion, is to move on to something new and save the polish for that.  At the same time try to stretch yourself with that something new.  So if you're currently not using a 3D API, learn one and use it.  If you are using one, learn the other and use it.  Or move up to a more advanced level at the one you are using.  Include a better sound, physics or input engine from the get-go.  Whatever, what I see as the important thing is to move a little outside of your current comfort zone and build up more skills and knowledge, while having fun doing so.
