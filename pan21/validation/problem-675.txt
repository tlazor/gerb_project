Most of the indie games that have made it big in the past few years have published extensive development blogs, engaged with the gaming community, and eventually released their games on Steam. Buzz for games like World of Goo, Braid, Super Meat Boy, VVVVVV, and others often took a year or more to build up. Many of them were made by 2-person teams consisting of a programmer and an artist. Polish and beauty are very important when you're trying to get noticed.
Though definitely a key to success with indie development is promoting it through social media.  The game can be fantastic, but if no one ever hears about it then no one will play it.  So while you are developing, start a blog or forum or something to build a community and when you have a demo/trial mode ready try to find indie game reviewers that will play it and blog about it on their websites.
I am not sure the size of these games you are planning, but I have seen a lot of success with indie developers on the Steam store (Terraria is a great example of a game that earned $1 000 000 within one year of when development started).  But if you are planning on a series of small games, maybe it would be best to make a website and use silverlight and let people play for free, and try to make money on advertising (similar to Addicting Games).
