The way it works is that the server sends you a bit of text, asks you to encrypt it and decrypt it with your public key.  Only the person with your private key can do this.
I would say that a better analogy is that the server's public key is the open lockbox with a latch that you can close (but not open), only the server can open it. The real question is whether you trust the public key (is that really Alice's Box?) , wherever you get it from it is public by definition, and that is what PKI's are about. 
I don't quite understand the theory behind keeping public keys on the server. In the lockbox analogy of public/private keys, to unlock Alice's box, Alice holds the private key while the public key is distributed to Bob. It would seem that the server plays the role of lockbox, so why does it hold the public key?
but so that the private key cannot be discovered by anyone who only knows the public key. The public key is what you send to other parties, to whom you want to authenticate yourself, or to whom you want to send encrypted messages. The public key is not sensitive, and does not need to be protected. It can be disseminated publicly.
You as the user are the one to provide the information that you are you when you log in.  So for the sake of authorization, you need the private key because the server will ask anyone who pretends to be you (attempts to logs in with your name) to prove it.
