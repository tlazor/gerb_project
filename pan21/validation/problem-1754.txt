But it is hard to tell that the result is what the comments is saying. Without having a context on what time is (which is a bad variable name) it is hard to understand the result of the function.
It appears that the method sometimes returns a timestamp (time) and sometimes it returns a duration (difference between timestamps) (assuming that time is always a timestamp - if not, then this issue simply moves to time having a dual definition).
Since the method has a return value even if the code is not finished processing the first line of your javadoc ought not read "Get the time taken for process to complete" but perhaps rather "Get the current or total processing time" or something of that nature? I also agree with Bert F's comment, but if there were clear comments explaining the behavior and you don't intend on exposing start and end times individually then there's no reason to waste an extra variable; you can either keep the code as it is and add comments or optionally get rid of the boolean "processRunning" and instead use your completedTime/runTime variable to establish the fact that it's still running. All minor gripes, all in all.
I just think this reads easier, and its easier to comment this. Now set me on fire for multiple return statements :D
