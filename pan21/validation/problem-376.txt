It's quite difficult for the kernel to actually use up a whole GB of memory; this could happen with memory-intensive device drivers, or if you also enable the /PAE switch, which induces increased memory management overhead.
The system reports 3.25 GB RAM and taskmanager reports the process of sqlserver.exe with 2758255 K as the process with the highest consumption.
Somebody told me that if the OS runs out of memory within his part of RAM, the server runs into pressing mode.
The best option here would be switching to x64 Windows; even if you only have 4 GB of physical memory, you could at least use all of them and not need to worry about kernel/user space issues anymore. You're using SQL Server 2005, so this is a viable option (unless you have other application issues).
The OS separates RAM for applications and for itself, normaly 50:50. But here we have the /3GB-Switch aktivated and i think the part for the applications is more than 50% of RAM.
i have at customer side a server (win2003 R2 SP2 standard edition 32-bit) with a sql-server 2005 and some databases. This system starts with  the /3GB-Switch.
thanks for your attention. i regrett my humble question but the problem is described om the following blog. http://blogs.msdn.com/slavao/archive/2006/11/13/q-a-does-sql-server-always-respond-to-memory-pressure.aspx
Never heard about this "pressing mode", and Google can't seem to find nothing about it; howewer, this could actually be a problem, but usually it isn't.
You sure that the one who told you about this "pressing" mode didn't actually call that thing "paging"?
