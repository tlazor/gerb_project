This type of damage happens when the hinge mounts break inside the laptop and put stress on other parts of the case.
Ok, so I have fixed this type of damage hundreds of times. But, it's not likely something that will turn out too well for you unless you have a great deal of mechanical inclination and experience.
Every laptop is completely different but I've not seen one that couldn't be fixed. Basically you need to drill a hole all the way through the case, use your nuts and washers and screws and other ingenuity to rebuild the mounts with proper spacing/gaps. The screws will go all the way through the case, then you can take a dremel and cut and polish up the ends. I always secure the nuts with loctite (you might want to do a dry run first and make sure it is right). I also often use a soldering gun to reposition and melt new nuts or other parts in to place of the broken pieces.
The short answer though is that I keep a supply of small stainless steel screws of different lengths and matching nuts and washers. I'd tell you exactly what kind if I didn't have them at another location. They are small metric screws that match the existing laptop screws and mounts, so I can re-use parts if possible. I get the from the local hardware store.
