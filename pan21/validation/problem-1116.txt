As we only see this particular log file and don't have any further information, it is absolutely impossible to determine the cause of the problem. Common causes for a crash can be high temperature, broken hardware (RAM, CPU, mainboard) or broken software (bugs, alpha software, deadlocks)
I just had my web server lock up on me, it stopped serving pages and wouldn't accept any SSH connections.  I was able to reboot this server through the control panel Linode provides.  Below you'll see the last few entries in the syslog before the freeze, any idea what this means and/or how to prevent this from happening in the future?  The server is running Ubuntu 10.04 (32-bit).
This doesn't mean anything. At least it has nothing to do with Postfix. It is just a coincidence that the last readable line is from Postfix. And they confirm success.
Which program do you use to view the logfile? If it is less then it is common to see something like that. The last junk of bytes may come from the crash of your system. The syslog deamon was unable to complete it's job to write the last lines or they are from a corrupted file system and you see bytes from a neighbored file.
