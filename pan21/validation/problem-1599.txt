% Disk Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read or write requests. 
On a server where you would try to match the right level of high-performing disks to the workload, you would consider the disk subsystem to be a potential bottleneck if the % active (busy) time plateau-ed above 80%.  On a workstation if this number is high, it just tells you that your disk performance is maybe what is slowing down your work.   
I’m pretty sure it is the same as the Perfmon counter "PhysicalDisk _Total %time".   (It tracks this counter in lock-step.)
This shows the percentage of time that the disk is not idle and is actively serving requests. If a disk is constantly running at very, very high levels (say, more than 80%), it may point to a storage-related bottleneck. If your users are seeing performance issues, and you’re seeing 100% active times, you might need faster or more disks.
Basically, it is the percentage of elapsed time that the physical drive(s) were busy. So Even though your MB/s usage may be low, the % busy time can be high if the disk is heavily fragmented, or is otherwise thrashing on lots of small operations. 
As to your last question:  I'm quite certain it is the physical disk and not any kernel or process time.  While waiting on the physical diskthe kernel blocks whatever processes is waiting on that disk operation, and uses the CPU for whatever else needs doing.
