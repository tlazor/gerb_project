The problem you are ultimately trying to solve is with the capacity of the application - and that's where you should be solving the problem. None of the components you mention has anything to do with session management for an HTTP application.
There are some tricks you can apply with the recent module in iptables or using fail2ban in the opposite way to the purpose it was designed for - but these both require a very detailled understanding of the tools and the problem domain. You could implement access control at the level of these components but driven by published state information from the application on the number of sessions.
Assuming, for the time being, that the application is a black box with no scope for modification / instrumentation (which is highly improbable) you can get this information from your apache logs by including the session cookie - filter or tail the logs to maintain a list of active cookies - and remove entries from the list when they coincide with the logout URL or have not been seen for the TTL.
