One simple way is Spotlight, in the upper right hand corner of the file window or the desktop screen; that's plain text for file names and strings. Grep is possible with Terminal and *unix commands (Terminal is in Applications/Utilities/). There's Aqua Command-Line Tools, though it looks old.
Using AppleScript (and do shell script to use Perl) it's possible to run a script to select all the files that match a regular expression. This can be combined with programs such as FastScripts and is actually documented and available for download by the developer on his blog.
Some programmer's text editors offer a grep-like feature for searching for a regular expression across multiple files;  many (many) moons ago BBEdit had this feature (and probably still does; I just haven't used it for years).  I wouldn't be surprised to find that other tools targeted at the developer market also have similar features.
Both Spotlight and the Finder are an attempt at reaching out to the sort of people who keep the "For Dummies" line of books on shelves, and as such, are not capable of parsing regular expressions or anything else particularly fancy. A lot of people like PathFinder as a replacement but I find it more trouble than it's worth since the Finder will keep launching itself no matter what you do.
