Unlike the great Firefox Muter, it doesn’t concentrate on muting the sound itself, so it can’t be stopped by any script the websites are running, ’Mute Everything’ tries to mute your browser by pausing everything what is currently playing on the website. That will never cover it. There are always new sources developing. It can’t pause/detect websitetalkingheads even now, and who knows what will appear on the web tomorrow. And again, each time you need to click their button FIRST. That is, AFTER you got already startled by yet another very loud sound, right?
Mozilla Firefox Muter however, now that’s something else. It also installs a button, but you only need to click it once. Then it AUTOMATICLY MUTES ALL SOUND. And without making visual changes on the website you are viewing. Even if you (or the website itself) drags the volume slider on youtube video to the right, you won’t hear it, untill you click the button again. It even remembers your last setting after restarting the browser. It’s PERFECT.
It installs a button which you must click, then there you must start clicking in searching which tab is creating the sound, all this while listening to the loud sound already. MuteTab even sometimes says it there is no sound source (but you can hear it). If it does find it, then you have to click to stop it, after which MuteTab places a cover over that part of the web, with something like ‘object stopped by a MuteTab’.. I uninstalled this extension. It doesn’t protect me from being startled to death by sudden loud noises. And it’s even quicker to find the playing source on the webpage manually and stopping it myself.
Somebody please make addon/extension exactly like this for Chrome, because I’m seriously considering switching to Firefox for this!:)
