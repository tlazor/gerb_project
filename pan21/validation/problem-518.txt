Since the same thing happened in a new local admin account, maybe they pushed a locked preference out with the new user template. To check that, use the terminal as root to look in /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences
This pref appears to be controlled per user in the com.apple.screensaver.plist. Locking the Security preference pane doesn't affect this pref and a user still should be able to change it. If your Mac is bound to the directory, the IT department could be pushing the preference out to the machine. Look in ~/Library/Preferences/or in the /ByHost folders and see if there is a com.apple.screensaver type of file there.
Is your Mac bound to a Directory Service? It would have to be in order for the IT department to push Managed Client prefs on you. In OS X 10.5 you can see what server the Mac is bound to in /Applications/Utilities/Directory Services. I'm just curious since you appear to be able to make new local admin accounts. Most IT departments that bother to manage preference won't give local users any admin capability.
