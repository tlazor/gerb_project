On the other hand, more than one firewall on the same system is likely to cause you more problems for little or no benefit.
Sounds like you have too much security. This can cause issues if everything is fighting for the same resources (ie memory). The best security is your common sense. However, AVG is a very lightweight and powerful system. I run my systems with AVG and nothing else. Spyware is cleaned off my computer about once a month using Ad-aware, and I clean out all temp files and cookies and other nonsense including registry files using crap-cleaner (aka ccleaner).
Aside from that all i use is an AV program (AVG or McAfee because my ISP provides it), Windows Defender, and Windows Firewall.
It sounds to me like you're going a little overboard.  I regularly run the Windows firewall (I've found this to be more than sufficient when the computer in question is sitting behind a hardware firewall/router that has only specific ports opened for things I use) and Avast (free edition) for antivirus.  I'll occasionally use other tools like those you mentioned, but only if I'm trying to solve a particular problem, definitely not on a regular basis.
The #1 thing to help defend a Windows machine is to not be running as an administrator.  Was your dad an admin when that happened to him?
