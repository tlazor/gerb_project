To prevent unauthorized access , i guess you need to REMOVE that users permission from the file/folder which they are trying to access. If your using a domain controller , just add that user to the file/folder permissions and explicitly restrict their actions. 
fsmgmt.msc is your friend. Run this on the workstation in question and you will be able to see all shares, sessions, and open files on that particular workstation. From this utility you will be able to close any particular session and with folder permissions you should be able to restrict usage. However, it really depends on the privileges of the connecting user in question as to whether or not you can keep them out in this fashion. For instance, if the user is a domain admin.
Anyhow, I believe that fsmgmt will definitely get you moving in the right direction. Please write back and let us know how you made out!
If you think someone is access system hidden shares then they'll be doing it using an administrator account. Regularily check your local administrator group for membership. If you want to view who is accessing them then you will need to set up auditing then select object access sucess.
Configure the auditing options. You can audit files, drives , applications , etc. Just configure to audit success and failure.
