Of course if you do it recklessly, it will look weird OR it will require pixel perfect precision. But you can avoid it - give the player some range where they can climb, and with a lerp quickly adjust the position to the perfect spot.
you could just move the transform.y up n number of times until the feet are on the ledge and forget the physics temporarily, i think it will work fine, you can always measure the distance between falling objects and the player in case collision fails during a transform translation. to make sure a collision occcurs.. 
If the player is pressed against a climbable object then allow up/down to move it on the Y axis. During this state ensure it cannot move on the X axis. As you move you can call Animation.Sample on your climb animation to ensure the point in the animation matches the distance climbed rather than trying to time everything.
Then all you need to do is to set your character's state back to idle once the climbing animation is complete.
i believe you need more design choices here before you can make a proper decission, specifically, what can happen to the character while he is hanging/climbing?
Now this is assuming you have the whole hanging situation under control, meaning that if while you are hanging and any interaction happens, the character reacts properly.
since you said the game is physics based i asume that you might have a rock falling on your head while either hanging or climbing, so if this is the case i believe going for rootmotion might be the simplest solution, you just need to animate the climbing, while it's climbing it's in a slightly different hanging state, the only difference being that you cannot initiate the climbing action.
