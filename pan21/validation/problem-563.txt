This would mean that any certificates that come from a hostname under the example.com tree, or from 192.168.0.0/24 address block, would be signed by puppetca without any admin interaction.
(If that turns out to be the problem, either change puppet.conf on the agent to point to a working certname or certdnsname for the puppet master, or stop the puppet master, edit the puppet.conf to have the certname and certdnsnames you want, blow away its ssldir (puppetmaster --configprint ssldir), and restart the master.) 
If the hostname the agent is using to contact the master IS a valid hostname for the master but ISN'T in the "subject common name" (certname) or "subject alternative name" (certdnsnames) fields in the master's SSL certificate, you'll be in a world of pain. 
So, clean the old certificates out for the ca, and puppet-master on the client side. Then remove the cert and cert listing in the inventory.txt, and this should work. 
I wanted to chime in to explain something I found: Let's say it was halfway working (where the client could contact the puppet-master, but now the certificate requests no longer show up). In my case, I had it halfway working, but then, I couldn't even SSH from the client to the puppet-master. Odd. In this case, I had to go through those same ssl directories (above) on the client site to remove the client and puppet-master certificates, and clean out the ca files for the puppet-master. On the puppet-master I had to do the mirror action of removing traces of the client certificate from all directories, AND the client listing in the /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/inventory.txt file. 
After doing this and rebooting both, I could then see the request. The issue was that the puppet-master had once had a valid cert listing for the client in the inventory.txt file in the /var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca directory, but I had cleaned out or deleted the actual certificate. My syslog on the puppet-master showed: "Certificate not found for host...", meaning it knew one was in inventory, but the actual certificate was on metaphorical 'back order' or just plain missing.
This is actually the kind of behavior you'll see if autosigning is enabled. You can look at the contents of /etc/puppet/autosign.conf to see exactly which domains this is enabled for.  For example, suppose that file contained the following:
