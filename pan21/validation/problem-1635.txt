The key to merging your datasets is to extract a list of the unique names.  This is much easier if the names are all in one column.  If you must have your data arranged as you've shown, there is a VBA solution, so comment below if you need that.
The IFERROR() inserts blanks for rows that would have a #NUM! error when the formula runs out of unique values.
The two SUMIF() formulas just add up the Score and Value numbers for each name.  The IF() inserts a blank for rows where the length of column E is < 1 (i.e. the cell has no name and appears blank).
How it works: The inner COUNTIF() creates an array of the number of times each of the names in column A appear in the growing list in column E. The MATCH() finds the position of the first 0 (corresponding to a name that hasn't been listed yet) in that array, and that is used as the row_num in an INDEX(), which picks the name out of column A. Names which have already been listed do not appear again.
In the first table below, I've moved your "B" data under the "A" data, and added a few more rows in each section.
These two formulas, filled down from F2 and G2, add up the Score and Value for each name in the list:
