As an aside, the Comcast bridge isn't entirely transparent, the Modem retains its IP address (10.0.0.1) to which I can connect via http and reconfigure (fortunately) when I attach a laptop directly to it Port 1 on the Modem. So, my laptop understands how to deal with the Modem in bridge mode, even if the Router does not.
I believe this is the best option for the network because the Modem steps out of the way completely and the Router can run security, VPN, DDNS, etc.
First off, you shouldn't need to place your modem in "bridged mode" or even mess with it, as Comcast keeps this under lock anyway. From the router enter the configuration example that Ron placed above. So for example, the Gi0/0 should be your outside interface it is the ISP/Internet facing interface- i.e., Comcast -  and your Internal interface is Gi0/1 the commands are no different except the descriptions and "IP Nat overload" if you are doing PAT as Comcast only gives you 1 IP address so using 1 to 1 maybe more helpful to you. interface command - after you created a DHCP & NAT Pool according to your public IP addressing scheme. Good luck Brother!
I tried to set the Modem into Bridge mode and had a very unpleasant 90 minute period where my internet access was down and had to endure some very angry users. I'm guessing I failed to configure the Router WAN port correctly. Probably because it was in DHCP mode. I'd like to try to set it to a static address (e.g. 10.0.0.2/24), however I'm a little gun shy about Bridge Mode, right now.  Google generates plenty of hits when searching for "Comcast Bridge Mode", however I haven't been able to make much use of what I found.  I haven't been able to find a good incantation for Router WAN port configuration with Comcast Bridge mode.
I'm also confused how in Bridge Mode the Router gets dynamic settings from Comcast ISP (for DNS and default Gateway, etc.) like it would with DHCP. Or, if these are not really dynamic and I should just hard code them in the Router configuration file.
Here, I can finese whatever configuration problems I might be having and just drop the Router (with a static IP of, say, 10.0.0.2/24) into the Modem's DMZ and let all internet traffic be forwarded to this. There's not a whole lot different between this configuration and the one above, except that the Modem is still acting like a Layer 3 device (well, even more like a Layer 3 device). I'm fairly certain I can get this working and I see no reason why I couldn't get VPN working through the Router.
You need to have your router receive DHCP for its WAN address. You will also need to configure NAT and DHCP (unless you have that on another server) on the router.
You can typically log into the customer premise equipment (CPE) by connecting to it via your web browser.  (Yours is done like this).  So, look at what your DHCP provided ip default gateway is (in windows open command prompt type ipconfig/all).  Plug that IP address into your browser to connect.  You may need to add /admin after the address.  Search based on your model CPE.
Once in there, most CPE's allow you to assign your single public IP address to a device in your home network.  You would apply that IP address to your router.  From there, configure it as you wish.
Modem runs as DHCP Server, NAT and firewall with inside address 10.0.0.1/24. The Router's WAN port is connect to it with a dynamic address (DHCP client). On the Router's LAN side, it is also running NAT (yes, double NAT'ed, for now), DHCP Server, DNS, NTP.
When you have the modem in bridge mode, your laptop works because it is using DHCP to get its IP address and other information from Comcast. You will need to set the router to do the same thing.
I'm guessing he recommeneded this set up because by placing the Modem on the Switch directly, you take advantage of the Switch's ability to short cut IP packets after connection establishment. That is, once an internal device connects through the Modem (presumably, connection establishment started with VLANs on the Router), the Switch recognizes this and routes all relevant IP packets directly between the internal device and the modem, skipping the Router. This cannot occur in the physical configuration under which the Modem and the Switch are on Router ports.
When I chatted with a Network Engineer a while back, he suggested that I could run the Modem directly into the Switch. We didn't go into details regarding the configuration. My assumption is that either of the above scenarios (Bridge or DMZ) could work just as well into the Switch directly with the following provisions:
The one drawback here is that the Modem only provides for dyndns.org for running Dynamic DNS. I have no opinion about this organization as a DDNS provider, however, I'd like a choice of vendors, something the Router would allow. Also,  the engineer in me wants as little unnecessary processing on the WAN path, so bridging the Modem just feels better.
My ultimate goal is to run a VPN through my Cisco Router, which to me means getting the Comcast Gateway out of the way.  To this end, I would like to place my Cisco Router (and/or Switch) logically closer to the WAN and remove my Comcast Modem as a logical device. I cannot really remove the modem (it provides the WAN access, after all), however, I do not need its DHCP, NAT or firewall services. I'd like configuration advice.
