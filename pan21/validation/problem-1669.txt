Just stumbled upon this answer while researching for my own solution. The problem with incron is that it does not monitor sub-directories and folders.
I have setup a web server running nginx and another server running php-fpm on Linode VMs. Nginx proxies all PHP requests off to the PHP backend and this works great.
We have a similar setup with nginx in front of ruby app servers.  We're using gluster in this scenario.  The load-balanced web servers are the gluster servers, with the app servers as the gluster clients.
The problem, is that the actual web files need to exists on both the web server and PHP worker and need to be synced.
How is this accomplished? I was thinking an optimal solution would be using shared storage (NFS) and mounting the storage on each server, but I don't have experience with this. Any good guides on this? Is this even possible with Linode?
Also another solution (though not good), would be to run something like rysnc every 3 seconds, but there would be sync lag, and not to mention all that extra network activity.
