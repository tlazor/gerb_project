Is there any experience out there for a largeish scale OS X setups? An immediate problem I can think of are the usernames. I guess they will have to be manually changed. 
I have about 30 latest MacPro's and I need to install a bunch of software on them. So I was thinking about doing it all on 1 machines and then cloning the driveto 30 others. It would be nice if that can be done over network so all 30 at once but I guess that is asking rather much. Any ideas? I had a look at CarbonCopy and that seems promising. There is also CloneZilla.
There are a number of options, with a general tradeoff between how much effort you put into setting up vs. how much effort there is per computer once it's set up. Here are some general techniques (note: most of these are based on Snow Leopard; Lion changes things a bit and I don't have any experience with it yet):
Perhaps thisis an age old question, but as we started to have more and more Macs in the department I feel the need to streamline the setup time.
