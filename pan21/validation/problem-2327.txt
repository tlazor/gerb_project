If you only have one drive you do not even get a choice. You have to have something to install the OS to, and for windows that is a partition. 
The big reason it's better to have a strong partition plan at install time instead of messing with it dynamically once your OS is installed is usually a matter of data preservation.   Many utilities will let you truncate a partition that has data in it, which can leave the drive in a corrupted state and require reinstallation of the OS or any applications which lost files due to the change.  That's the extent, however; the HDD or SSD doesn't suffer abnormal aging or stress by doing partition changes. 
Partition it before/during the installation so that you can put the user data on it's own partition independent of the OS files.
(For completeness sake: For almost any OS that will be a partition, though you could tell BSds etc to use the raw drive in dangerously dedicated mode. And I would not be surprised if QNX, GNU/Linux etc also supported this).
Many filesystems (eg ext3/ext4) make decisions about optimizing reserved structures (eg sizes of inode tables, superuser-reserved space, just maybe even the size of pointers used). It is questionable whether these structures remain optimally tuned if the filesystem size is significantly altered, especially by online resizing tools for which altering filesystem fundamentals would be to hazardous. For example, a too-small inode table on ext3 (intended for a much smaller filesystem) could make you run into a condition where the filesystem runs out of "slots" for files, so you can suddenly not create any new file and get an out of space error even with plenty space left. A too-large inode (that was meant for a larger filesystem) table would waste space.
Since the OS doesn't require much (a relative term...) space, you can make he OS partition relatively small, and the user partition large.
Anecdote: I use Linux, and my user data (called /home) has been on it's own partition for 17 years.  It's allowed me to copy my data from disk to disk without worrying about the OS or version.
