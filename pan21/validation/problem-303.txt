They provide Proxmox VE Cluster which "enables central management of multiple physical servers". The central management is done via a web-based admin interface.
The 32bit installation process is partially described for an older 1.x Version of proxmox VE that actually is not comparable any more with today's versions.
It provides support for OpenVZ and KVM instances via a bare-metal Debian install. You wouldn't be able to use KVM but you could use OpenVZ. 
They also support live migration: "Proxmox VE support live migration of Virtual Machines via web interface."
Citrix Xen server provides a centralized type thing you are looking for. With the free version you are able to move a guest that is off from server A to server B. However, the XenServer management server is the part that costs money, it provides for High Availability, like hot fail-over and the like.
They're both based on Xen, both have management GUIs, various tools, etc. In terms of functionality of these commercial but free products, I think only Oracle VM supports both live migration and high-availability in it's free version.
For your other questions, the performance difference between virtualised and "bare-metal" performance is typically around 5%-10%, not a significant amount really compared to the management benefits. The hit is often in the area of disk I/O rather than CPU usage.
"Best" is always very subjective, as is inexpensive, but for free the best options are Citrix XenServer and Oracle VM.
You're right that often these implementations have a single non-virtual management server, but generally there's no reason why they can't be virtual themselves, it's just that tracking it down in the event of a failure can be tricky - you end up asking the question "which box has it ended up on when it failed over?". Assuming you setup the correct failover rules, you'll be able to work it out without a problem, and with only 5 physical hosts it's not a huge issue to track it down anyway.
