Realistically I want ESXi management network for vSphere to use the public network nic so that I can control it, and the Virtual Machines should also use the public network nic so they can be reachable servers.
I'd then use that second private NIC for ESXi management traffic only, behind that firewall, on a private subnet, plugged into the LAN port of the firewall.  You could then tunnel across from your office and have access to your ESXi management completely isolated from your public VM network in case of misconfiguration, but also to protect your management network from the public Internet.
What Massimo said is technically correct, but I think I'd burn an IP from the hosting provider and set it up on the WAN interface on a firewall (could be an ALIX pfSense box) with an IPSec tunnel terminating at your location.  
Has a vSwitch setup with both physical nic cards, one of them is for the public network of the host server and the other is for the private network.
Without mapping one of the nics to a second vSwitch, will ESXi and my VMs actually be able to use both nics?
The private nic can stay on the box so that the hosting provider can monitor it and provide me access via IPMI as needed, but otherwise I don't think I need it...
If you want all traffic (both management and VM) to go to the public network, then the NIC connected to the private network is effectively useless; you can ask your hosting provider to connect it to the public network just like the other one, then map them both to the same vSwitch, and you'll get automatic load balancing and failover for the server's network connection.
