However, with a USB stick, the primary bottleneck is the flash memory itself. Due to the way in which Flash chips work, certain write operations (specifically, modifying a sector without rewriting it entirely) are quite time-consuming. Solid-state-disks have some extra logic built in to speed up this kind of access but memory sticks generally don't. I have frequently used Ubuntu off a live USB stick (mainly to use my work PC for personal purposes when on the road because I didn't want to drag two laptops along), and at times it will just hang for a few seconds, then continue. Apart from that it worked flawlessly.
Sorry, I know this is an old post, but I see a lot of people wanting to use their older machine for stuff rather than just throw them out. The solution is simple. Get an IDE (PATA) to mSATA adapter, & a mSATA SSD. mSATA is smaller than laptop SATA drives, so with the adapter, the whole thing will fit in the space for the original hard drive. Many of the adapters have wear leveling technology for SSDs too if the OS or mSATA drive won't manage it.
It mainly depends on how heavily the disk is being used. For simple things like Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreOffice and even the occasional movie the data throughput of USB 2.0 should be sufficient.
If you have any chance of borrowing a stick, your best bet is to try it out. A live image should be sufficient to tell if performance is OK. In addition it allows you to test whether your PC will boot from USB at all (I still have two boxes from ca. 2003 which don't).
If you're planning to buy new hardware anyway, though, then you might be better of getting an external USB disk or replacing the internal one. A small one will do â€“ maybe you can pick up a used one cheaply. The live image will work with as little as 2 GB, but of course it depends on how many extra applications you're going to install and how much data you're going to keep.
