If you are using Word 2010, open the document, click on the Mailings tab, click the down arrow under the Start Mail Merge button, click on Normal Word Document. This will disconnect the Word document from the source document.
In my case I wanted to un-merge the data - keep the document as a mailmerge but not show peoples' specific details in the document each time I opened it. I finally was able to do this by going through the mailmerge wizard, and when it came to selecting recipients with the little checkboxes, unchecking all of them. When I closed the wizard it looked like a mailmerge form again without individual data; I saved it as a new document to maintain this.
If you don't save the document after disconnecting the data source, obiously the problem will recur.
Answering "No" to this prompt was not enough to disconnect the data source. Go to the Mailings tab, click the Start Mail Merge button in the Start Mail Merge group, then select Normal Word Document from the dropdown. Then save the document.
Go to File then-> Options then-> Trust Center then-> Trust Center Settings then->  Privacy Options then-> Document Inspector then-> Inspect and then remove XML data.
