So sure, you can annoy people by blocking other ports outbound, but as long as you're allowing HTTPS it's utterly pointless from a security standpoint; it won't prevent a determined adversary for more than a minute, and it'll really annoy all your legitimate users.
I'm going to differ with the answers already here, and say no, almost certainly not.  If you have any of your systems externally, then allowing unencrypted connections to them might expose eg login IDs that you have an interest in keeping secure, but since we're talking egress filtering I'm guessing you don't have any such systems out there, so by blocking unencrypted services (ftp, pop, imap) you're only protecting other people's secrets, and that's not your job.
The approach you should probably take would be to state the business case for a protocol's allowance - and try to find middle ground, if needed, like allowing IMAP only to approved servers.  Remember, there's likely a policy reason that it was put in place.
Moreover, it's pointless.  As long as you allow port 443 outbound - and there would be a riot in any organisation I've ever worked in if that was forbidden - you've got users making SSL-encrypted tunnels out of the building left, right, and centre, and you have no idea what they're passing through them.  Could be HTTP, sure, but it could also be SSH, could be IMAP, could be OpenVPN, could be anything at all as long as it's inside that SSL-encrypted tunnel.
It's simply a question of what level of risk is acceptable to your organization, really.  As far as whether it increases security, I'd answer with a qualified yes - generally speaking, it's a good security step, but it needs to be done well to be effective (I'd be surprised if they were just blocking certain ports specifically - more likely, they're allowing only certain whitelisted ports).
Our network admins/security admin make the case that we should keep common (external facing) ports (FTP, XMPP, IMAP, IPSEC) closed as it is a greater security risk and makes us more susceptible to attack. While I can appreciate that these choices are made with security in mind, it tends to make work difficult at best and challenging at worse for our end-users/staff/consultants.
Example scenarios where it'd be of use are security issues like botnet zombie reporting and spam relaying, as well as policy/bandwidth use issues like bittorrent or streaming video.
