I just bought an external drive (seagate backup plus) to make backups of my ubuntu system. There's something I've been thinking about: is it possible to make a copy of my system on the drive, so I can plug it into another computer with, say, a windows system, and boot my ubuntu copy from it? So I'd be able to work as if I brought my computer with me? Then I could just replace the files I changed back on my computer. How would I do that?
That said, a Ubuntu Live USB drive with persistent storage is practical. This starts out as the basic .ISO to test or install Linux, and then can be customized to add data and applications of your choice, such as Kate text editor, Synaptics package manager, or even a Windows application like IrfanView (I copied the Program Files\IrfanView folder to a new folder in my /home directory, and it works well under wine).
N.B. Flash drive write time is slower than HDD, so such a system is lethargic. An inexpensive external SSD or HDD should be speedier.
You also need to make sure that the external drive is the same size or bigger than drive to which Ubuntu is installed.
You can use the dd command but it's a bad idea as it most likely won't work properly if it even boots at all.
As @Nasir Riley states, a clone of a system from one PC to another might not work for a few reasons, such as specific drivers being needed for different model PC's and EFI preventing boot. You could give it a quick try, anyway, if you'd use the clone on just one other PC.
The best way to do it is to use software like Clonezilla (it's free) or Acronis to back up your Ubuntu installation and restore it to your external drive but even while that will have your system booting properly, there's a significant chance that it won't function properly.
