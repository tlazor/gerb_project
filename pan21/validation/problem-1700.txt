SVN over HTTPS is considered as secure as your HTTPS configuration (so disable SSLv2, use a strong certificate and you're probably fine).
I know that I can run svn through svnserve (although I do not have any experience with it), but I don't know if there are any pitfalls to doing so. I read that using svn+ssh doesn't let svn cache passwords, which I'd like to happen, but I'm not sure if svn:// without ssh is secure or not.
I've recently switched from svn:// to https:// mainly because I can configure LDAP authentication in Apache so I don't have to configure separate usernames/passwords for the repositories.
However svnserve does have its advantages - it's easy to set up and zero configuration (for the server.)
Plus if you're running HTTP or HTTPS anyway, it makes sense to utilise that service instead of having to maintain another service.  I have my SVN as a separate virtual host in Apache.
I'm curious as to why you want to switch from Apache to something else? (I've no experience of nginx.)
All other things being equal I would chose the path of least complexity (#2 - Apache for www & svn).
I'm setting up my new VPS for my Rails application and was thinking about transferring my sites from apache to nginx (in order to do that, I would also have to convert my apache config over to nginx's, which I would have to learn). However, one thing that makes me think before doing this is that I want to host my SVN on the new VPS as well, and I know that SVN doesn't run on nginx.
My main beef with svnserve is that authentication is on a per-repository basis, so if like me you have one repository per application, and you have upwards of 20 repositories, you have a maintenance headache on your hands.
