You didn't tell us what your graphics card is, so this answer will have to be fairly generic, but basic OpenGL support is inherent to that graphics card itself. 
The other aspect to which version of OpenGL is recognised as being supported is provided by your graphics drivers; so the next thing to do is test is whether they are reasonably up to date.
Some background reading from Wikipedia : OpenGL but you don't need to understand all of that just to check your graphics card & drivers.
There is a further consideration, specific to Mac so shouldn't be affecting you, which is that Apple dropped native OpenGL support some time ago, but has maintained support of base-level OpenGL 2.1, so that shouldn't be your issue if, again, your machine/card is newer than 2006.
Any help or suggestion. Im using win7 Dual core 64bit with 4 GB Ram. I want to install the software called Blender and its requirement is 2.1. 
OpenGL 2.1 is actually considered a base standard that many applications will support. It dates from 2006, so if your graphics card is newer than that it ought to support it.
