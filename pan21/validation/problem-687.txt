I am running MySQL 5.0.51a on Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition on an HP DL580 G4 with 3GB installed.  One of my database tables has grown to 5.3 GB with an index file of 2.5 GB, which I believe is causing MySQL to be slow due to having to constantly load and unload the index file when updates are made to the table.  The server itself seems to be performing OK because MySQL is only using about 500MB of memory (there are other apps running on the system, but MySQL uses the most memory).
It sounds like you are running MySQL with MyISAM tables. In this configuration, it is rather common for a MySQL server not to consume a significant amount of memory. Contrary to InnoDB or MS SQL Server, which are reserving considerable amounts of memory in-process for data and index pages of the database, MyISAM is mostly relying on the OS filesystem cache for buffering disk data with the notable exception of the key buffer.
So I have started to look for alternatives to avert the crisis I know is coming soon.  Some of the options I have:
If you are seeing slow inserts or updates, it might be worth examining the SHOW PROCESSLIST output and looking for the state of your connections performing the DML statements. If you see index-related activity for prolonged periods of time, consider increasing key_buffer_size.
If you're staying on the same hardware you'd want to go Linux. Option 2 is only successful when going to a new platform. 
Credit to MYSql for running so well in your current environment. Options 2 and 3 are your best bet. As a Windows guy, if it were me, I'd be going to an x64 platform. Overkill on the RAM and drive arrays, and you're golden.
Even on 32-bit Windows without PAE or the /3GB switch, you should be able to have individual processes address up to 2GB of RAM.
You probably have a maximum memory value set in my.conf. Find that file in the MySQL directory, edit the max memory value to something sane and restart the MySQL service. 
If anybody has suggestions for things to do in the meantime, opinions on which way to go, or other things that I have overlooked I would appreciate the help.
The table is fairly active with new records getting adding all during day but no deletes, ever.  The MySQL server has up to 600 connections allowed, but only small number (10 or 20) would actually be writing to this table.  I increased the memory limits in MySQL but since the max connections is so high I don't think I can give each connection 1GB without risking a problem.  Is there some tuning that would let just certain connections get a lot of memory?
Server Enterprise has a pretty high license cost to get into (I believe). It's feature-set is tailored at higher-end computing and still will limit MySQL to only 4 gig of space (I believe, - my enterprise knowledge is based on reading, not much hands on).
