I have one. I mean identical in appearance -- even the mounding of the connectors appears exactly identical.
Another possibility--I have a very old digitizing tablet, separated in location now. (Will relocate in next few months, then can check if fits.)
What I know is we have UPS devices, old APC Back-UPS, etc., but all of them seem to have DB-9. Then we have various generations of KVM switches, but not the manufacturer mentioned having such a port that is unexplained by audio connection. (This would not be audio--nobody in his right mind would hook audio to db-9.) We have iPod, iPad, and iPhone -- but never recall purchasing a cable like that. However I see on eBay such a cable of nearly identical, but metal connector, sold as a "data cable" for iPhone/iPod/iPad. Can't find any documentation to support, and the sale gives none whatsoever.
many mobile devices use 3.5mm jack for serial console. my bet is that if you open the DB9 housing - you will find a TTL-to-RS232 convertor chip in there
In some cases, it is a specially made Video Cable for PolaroidÂ®'s PDC-300, Fun! 320, & Fun! Flash 640 cameras.
I present all this for possible elimination. My memory was an older UPS, but can't find one that matches.
We've had them lying around too.  They're usually thrown in the box to give you serial console access to a wide variety of gadgets.  Have a look for ISDN terminals, video projectors or UPS devices.  Could even be a graphing calculator!
