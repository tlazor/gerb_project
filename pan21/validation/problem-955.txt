our IT manager decided to move on and quit. the company managing director hired some slick who had no idea about IT but they went to the same posh school so i suppose on the interview they were talking b0llox about old times, rowing challenges, booze and girls.
Our building used to be a bank, so we keep our servers in the vault. Cooling isn't great, but we only have half a dozen, and none of them are hugely powerful, so it's not really an issue.
and you say cleaning lady. she surely would do better job (especially for the amount he was paid). the only good stuff in that story is that the whole IT department, each of us went to the MD one by one and told that is going to be a disaster if he stays. luckly MD realised that is something really wrong if everyone said that and fired the idi0t.
The cleaning lady with a hoover and security guard with a coffee machine. ha-ha. at least they are not paid to know all the IT stuff. here is the real halloween story.
Once inside the server room, all the servers are held in enclosed racks.  The front and rear doors of each rack are locked, and only IT personnel are given rack keys.
on his second week the new IT manager went to the server room and stayed after hours for a while making himself familiar with the setup (I still have no idea what he was doing there). because the aircons are quite strong in there he switched them off. after few hours of joking around he went home (perhaps very satisfied, perhaps even literally - I dont exclude possibility him watching p0rn there). surely he was very tired (long hours lot of noise etc) so he naturally forgot to switch the aircon back.
We also keep the networking closets on all floors locked, and only members of the Facilities team has keys for these doors.
by the morning the database server was cooked completely to halt and 2 other servers failed in next 2 days.
Our server room is protected via keycard.  Only IT personnel have keycards that will open the door, and only the Security department has control over your keycard's access permissions.
