About what is more important: it depends on the service you're offering. There are games which can't be played with even a minimal latency (i.e. FPSes), and there are ones which just don't care so much about it; and, of course, there are games which need more CPU/RAM/storage than others.
Ping is an ICMP echo request. It is a (poor) way of measuring latency. Basically, it's marketing jargon from your host that doesn't really mean anything meaningful. Latency would change depending on where you are accessing the server from, among other things. 
Pings vary by where they originate from, as they travel across the Internet.  For example, a server in California may not be the best idea if your community is "The City of Portland, ME".  If you have a geographically diverse community, you probably can't make a decision that will please all of your community members.  
Basically, you should contact them, tell them what you need, and ask them what the hell they actually measure ping latency from and why they even bother since it's a shitty metric. If they're a good host, they'll sell you what you need. If they're shady, they'll try and up-sell you like crazy. 
As MDMarra said, listening to a salesperson talk about ping times is going to get you nowhere.  Some may recall the KillerNIC ads by KillerGaming that advertised changing your pings from 40ms to -16ms*.  Salespeople are not to be trusted.
You should tailor your server's hardware configuration to your application requirements, based on the number of users that will be accessing it; this will require some benchmarking, of course. I don't know what load Minecraft poses on servers, nor do I know how many users are in your community, so it's impossible to tell you if one given hardware configuration will be enough for your needs, or if you will need more.
I would choose Hetzner server with 32 GB RAM. Don't use OVH they have very bad hardware, the disks are horrible and failing in about 1-2 months. I've replaced 16 drives in on year ! Now I'm using Hetnzer and no issues at all !
Network latency varies based on two main factors: the server's Internet connection, and the user's Internet connection; no hosting provider can tell you "we'll give you 60 ms ping time", because the only thing they can talk about is their Internet connection's bandwidth and latency, but they can't possibly say anything meaningful about how much latency a given user will have when connecting to their server (they could connect from completely different countries... and, of course, even two different ISPs in the same city can have completely different performance).
