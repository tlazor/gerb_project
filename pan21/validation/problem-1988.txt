I was going to take the renewal opportunity to move the website to a different server however someone else has gone ahead and part installed a renewed certificate on the same server.
Most likely you have only copied over the certificate chain, but not the private key for the SSL certificate.  It should mention if it has a private key in the certificate information.  When a certificate with a private key is first imported into Windows, there is an option to allow the private key to be marked exportable, if it is not (which is default), then Windows will not allow you to export the private key and move it elsewhere.  There might be some tools for getting around this, but it's certainly not Microsoft approved.  Look at the certificate information on the original computer and it should report that a private key is available, but I bet it's not exportable.
The problem is that the certificate is not installed in the proper key store. I mean it should be in Computer account. Make sure you are installing the private key to. Normally it should be in the same file. At the export time you have been asked for a password to encrypt the private key. The same password you have to use to import the key.
I understand this should be as simple as exporting the old certificate and importing the new one but I can't get it to work.
