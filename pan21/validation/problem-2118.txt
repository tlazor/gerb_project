is not using the same pointer, especially if it goes into hibernation. the grub boot would have to point to your windows boot sector or hiberfil.sys had a similar issue when I tried to edit winresume.exe to try to point to D: when windows is on C: it would not bring up windows from hibernation, when I used the copy of original is fixed it.
Then pressed "windows" on GRUB. Then BSOD, reboot, and windows cannot find the booting partition: "needed device missing". }
But for now, I will say this: apparently, on this precise configuration (Dell M4600), having GRUB on IRRT with Linux on the "real" hard disk, and windows on a mini-PCI-express SSD, with hibernation activated, seems unsafe, because the BSODs still happen even with GRUB disabled (which means the whole booting process is controlled by windows now, and even with that, it may have problems exiting hibernation - maybe the size of the 12 GB RAM, and thus 9 GB hyberfil.sys file, play a role here), and as one of these BSODs could kill my NTFS partition in my previous configuration, without any hardware fault (because my SSD still works very well - I haven't checked its health in deep details, though), I don't see why it could not happen again.
In the end, I could not understand the problem, and now my system is re-installed so I will probably never have additional clues about what happened. If one day I happen to have enough knowledge about the booting process, IRRT, Windows, GRUB, and the special disk configuration I have, I may end up guessing a better explanation. 
So, the solution exists, and it is not very pleasant, but the whereabouts of this precise issue are not clear yet. If anyone has any more insight here, I would be very glad to hear it.
The boot device is Internal HDD (IRRT), the only possible one; this enables IRRT, and starts GRUB, which by pointing to some sector on the HDD can start Windows 7 on the SSD.
Finally, I reinstalled windows on the C drive (the SSD), and when it was complete, the system did work again, but the boot sequence short-circuited GRUB. So now, the Linux installation is off reach. 
It's been a year now, and from time to time there where other BSODs when exiting hibernation, but never again did it cause any permanent damage to the file system.
I guess studying all about booting's answer is right somehow. the whole process "boot on HDD (IRRT) ->GRUB ->Correct pointer to windows bootloader->location of "out of hibernation" initialization sequence" must have failed somewhere, in a manner that no conventional repair tool could fix. 
It is still on my D disk, and I know I would just have to insert a live CD and repair GRUB to make it work, but I haven't done it yet, for other reasons.
