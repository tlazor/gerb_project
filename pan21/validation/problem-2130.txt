I was using a feature of winscp which can keep two directories in sync.  The problem is whenever I copy a file locally that is large... winscp tries to access it while it's still being copied.  As a result, it pops up an error saying that the file is in use and it can't copy a file... then it stops keeping directories in sync until someone clicks OK on the modal dialog box!!!  The winscp solution would be adequate if it just continuously kept trying to copy the file instead of showing an error message.  I've searched for an option and surprisingly it doesn't exist.
The program that monitors for file changes must run on windows.  I don't care what service it uses for the file transfer part (FTP vs SCP... etc)
Since I am looking for a better solution anyway... I'd also like it to run as a service or at least an app that automatically enters the sync mode when started.  
Changes on the windows box should be reflected on the remote computer.  Files are never changed remotely so it really just needs to be a one way sync.
