You are descibing an entry level system. Most users using this kind of system have no clue of database management. Many never heard of indexing / database normalization / ... Most likely they will burn cpu-cycles with redundant searches or expensive joins. In addition a responsive database needs a lot of RAM for the queries themselfes, the query cache (...). At this point it gets expensive for the ISP.
Harddisks are cheap. Even if an ISP promises some hundred GB to every single user, most of them will not use that space to the limit as transfering 100 GB to a server might take some time.
Besides 2 GB for a database is plenty for beginners. If you need more you might want to switch to a dedicated database server and SSDs.
My first guess is Backups and Transaction Log files. DB backups, even on small databases become quite large over time, requiring a backup cycling strategy. Transaction log files on high usage databases, even if they store only a small amount of data can become monstrous, and fill your drive with little or no warning. I've had a number of critical services stop because I too my eye off log file size, and filled the media. then you just get errors.
