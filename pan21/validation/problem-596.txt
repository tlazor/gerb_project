I'm downloading a site with wget and a lot of the links have queries attached to them, so when I do this:
If the server is kind, it might be sticking a Content-Disposition header on the download advising your client of the correct filename. Telling wget to listen to that header for the final filename is as simple as:
This will still show the ?foo=bar as you download, but will display the rest of the name in bright cyan.
But that's really the answer.  Instead of trying to do it all in one wget command, use multiple commands.  Now your workflow becomes:
I know I can do this after I get everything via a script to rename everything. However I'd really like a solution from within wget so I can see the correct names as the download is happening.
That solves your problem, but now you need to figure out how to grab the base files to find your mp3 URLs.
I think, in order to get wget to save as a filename different than the URL specifies, you need to use the -O filename argument.  That only does what you want when you give it a single URL -- with multiple URLs, all downloaded content ends up in filename.
OK.  Use wget as you normally do; use the post-wget script that you normally use, but process wget's output so that it's easier on the eyes:
Do you have a particular site/base URL in mind?  Steps 1 and 3 will be easier to handle with a concrete example.
