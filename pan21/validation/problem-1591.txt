Windows 10 is released as technical/Developer preview edition. Where I believe that the  NVidia drivers chip set you are using is not support with the latest version. Mostly all the drivers will be fixed and available in the RTM version of windows. Please check the status in NVidia website for support NVidia chip set.
Most likely this is due to an incompatibility with Windows 10 and nVidia.  Did you get the driver from the nVidia site or from Windows update?  If you installed the one from the nVidia site try and reinstall on that partition, and then get the driver through windows updates.
I recently installed windows 10 on a second partition of the hard drive on my laptop. As soon as a installed the NVidia drivers and restarted the computer, all that shows up is a black screen with the cursor. Every so often, the cursor will return to the original position (the middle of the screen) and turn into a "loading in the background" cursor for a couple of seconds. I have left it running for long periods of time to be sure that windows 10 was not just loading, it stays the same for the whole time. 
When I boot back into windows 8, the start says "scanning and repairing drive (K:)" (the partition that windows 10 is on).
