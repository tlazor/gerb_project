You can with 'pv' (apt-get install pv with Debian and ubuntu). I recommend to monitor the number of files transferred, since the amount of data transferred is not correlated to the size of files but on the delta between the source and destination. And counting files will count the same progress for one big delta and another one with small delta. Which means that in any case the ETA estimation might be far off. The size-based ETA only works if your destination is empty, in this case delta == size of source.
The general idea is to emit one line per file 'transferred' from rsync, and count those lines with 'pv':
I have searched for this option already, but have only found solutions that involve custom patching. The fact that it does not show in --help and no more info can be found probably indicates the answers is 'no', but I'd like to see this confirmed.
I tend to backup whole filesystems (for several reasons), in this case you can use the much cheaper df to get the number of files (rather than du or find wich will traverse your source hierarchy another time after rsync did it). The -x option appears to make sure rsync stays on the same source filesystem (and does not follow other inner mounts):
I use a script that extracts the information from /proc//io for the rsync process (or any other process for that matter) and knowing the total amount to be transferred is calculates the progress.
If you want to count files in /source in a general way, use find /source|wc -l (warning again: might be slow and heavy on I/O).
