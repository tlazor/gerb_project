Also, wherever possible, we try to use some form of strain relief on the server/device side.  See if you can Zip tie power cords against the back of the server so they are not taut.
For the last hop of the power connection (C13-C14, which seems to be what you are asking about), we use these special locking power cords from APC.
Every rack mount server I have purchased in the last 5 years, has came with power cable strain relief clips of some kind.  If properly used it would take a lot of force to pull the power cable.
Note that you only see the benefit using the APC cords with an APC PDU.  The APC PDU still accepts normal power cords.
We use APC racks, UPSes, and PDUs.  UPSes are hard-wired.  Connection from the UPS to the PDU is with a twist-lock cord (L5-20 or L5-30).
I use mostly IBM servers and they have various methods of anchoring the power cable.  NetApp filers are the same way, as are Juniper switches and I think routers. 
I have used Panduit cable-tie anchors for this sort of thing.  They have small "loops" through which you pass a cable tie and are backed with adhesive to stick to the chassis.
