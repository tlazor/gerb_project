Since we were already crunching on a deadline, this stands out in my mind as a reason to be wary of the MS Virtualization products. 
I happened to come across this particular issue trying to move test VMs from my development machine to dedicated test server and ended up having to rebuild the VMs from scratch in order get around it. 
Obviously the first and most important factor is that your new company uses VMWare. You should use VMWare because of that, end of story. Imagine a co-worker sends you a guest image, you can't use it because it'll be a VMware one (not without a lot of conversion time), and if you want to send it back to him - you'll have to convert it back to Vmware anyway.
VMware has many power saving features (especially in vSphere) which allow for hosts to go up and down as needed to save power.
I've never had an issue doing this with VMWare (Server 1.x/2.x, Workstation or Player), but I have with VMs created using Virtual Server (it was years ago so I can't recall the specific error but it had something to do with the user accounts and not having access to the VM). 
VMware has vMotion to move machines from one host to another live.  With vSphere 4.0 (just released) you've got the option to use VMware FT which is the new fault tolerant feature which allows for instant failover in the event of a hardware failure.
The most important reason to start using VMware would be that it's the platform that your new company has selected for their VM platform.
The other reasons anyone would want to use VMware over VS is that it has a lot more features - some have been mentioned, the fancy GUI toolkits to manage VMs like Lab Manager and Virtual Centre; the live migration, resource load balancing and backup facilties; but also the relatively little-known trick that VMware uses to share memory allowing you to run more VMs on a host than you'd have thought. That's pretty neat and allows you to run lots of low-resource VMs, or lots of similar VMs on a single box.
