I can only tell from my experience with Citrix XenServer (free edition). There an upgrade is really child's play. Download the .iso from Citrix, burn/write it on a CD/USB-Drive, boot from it and choose upgrade. It will only edit the existing partitions/files of your installation and will not touch your storage repository, where the virtual disks of your VMs reside. After a reboot, everything is as before, even the auto-boot-machines are back online.
But as I understand, your neither using the Citrix edition nor have the intention to do so. From my experience with KVM-QEMU, you should not have any problems with updating your virtualization environment (last time major upgrade even worked without a reboot). In all cases (if that is possible) I would recommend shutting down or suspending the VMs, your upgrade should at least go more quickly like that. If you can live with a little bit of downtime.
And btw: Aptitude always asks you if it wants to install more packages or if there are any conflicts. Or you can run it with --show-upgraded then it only shows what it wants to upgrade.
