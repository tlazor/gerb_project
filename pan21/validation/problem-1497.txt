Remotix sounds like what you're looking for.  It does VNC, RDP, and supports SSH tunnels (nice for remoting in via an SSH jumpbox!)
I tried ScreenRecycler for my Macbook and accessed it successfully with VNC via my second Laptop (as connected to the same WLAN) and it works if i enter the IP address of the MB. However, i am searching for a VNC client which offers my the ability to find the MB via Bonjour because i want to run the viewer on my Windows PC (i have Ubuntu too if this will work better!) which is connected via LAN and therefore it can't find the laptop, neither with a ping.
Furthermore, RealVNC seems to be painfully slow and therefore i want to know whether there is any faster client. My research had the result that there exists JollyFastVNC which is only available for Mac and therefore does neither support Windows nor Ubuntu...
Teamviewer doesn't user Bonjour, but you can add computers to a kind of contact list and connect to them with one click. Works over the internet as well.
If your LAN and WLAN (assuming that you mean Wireless LAN and not WAN) networks are isolated from one another, that's a bigger problem that you're gonna have to resolve before you go looking for a VNC client. You're not gonna be able to VNC between the machines regardless of what client you use.
