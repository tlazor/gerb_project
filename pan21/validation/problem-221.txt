Is there any way to run a set-up or installation wizard without admin rights? I know that you don't need admin rights to download .exe's and .zip's but set-ups and installation guides usually require admin rights.
However, this is dependent on the programming of the application and installer itself. You cannot change a software product that requires full permissions and therefore requires administrator privileges to install into a product that does not without changing the code of the application itself and the installer.
Some packages only need to write data to the unprivileged sections of the User profile. Certain installers will ask whether you want to install for all users or just the current user. With many of these, only installing for the Current User does not require administrative privileges.
It depends on whether or not the installer does anything that requires administrative rights on the operating system. 
If it doesn't, then yes, you can install it without admin rights. I don't know if this is true today, but it was possible to install CC Cleaner under Windows XP or Windows 7 (can't remember which) without admin rights. I'm a Linux Systems Engineer right now and haven't done Windows desktop support in a while but I believe it's possible to install the software for Xerox's printers without admin rights in Windows 10 (at least it was in Windows 7). Some of the other printer software allows it to be installed without admin rights.
So, if a product asks for admin rights to install, you will be generally unable to install it without these rights.
You can install programs to removable media like SD cards or a flash drive and then execute (run) on this computer in question. You may have to use a different computer for the initial installation and then bring the media to your target computer.
If it does, then no, you can't install it without admin rights whether that's with the account that you're using or running it as an admin or a different user.
Generally, programs written this way do not require significant privileges in the system, and are written to work correctly within the very limited permissions of the standard user directory.
