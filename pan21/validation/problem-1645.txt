The article that you link to doesn't actually give an algorithm for generating the mesh; it states a way to evaluate possible solutions.
Can your solution be better? Meh. Sure. Probably not worth it. I think occlusion culling or LOD would be better next steps. Minecraft wastes a good number of cycles drawing the surface even when you're underground, as well as drawing vast networks of cave and mine systems when you're on the surface. Once you've got a good mesh breakdown, yeah, getting rid of obscured surfaces can be a good thing -- but (e.g.) generally it's faster to let your video card do backface culling than to do it on the CPU.
Generally, though, the article gives a good summary: 1) the naive solution is bad, 2) there's an optimal solution, but it will be both time-consuming to write and to run, 3) a quick culling gives much better results (and this is all Minecraft itself does), and finally 4) there might be a smarter solution (the greedy algorithm).
The "solution" that you imply in the image in your question is the greedy algorithm. It seems your question is "did I implement his solution correctly?" to which I must answer "he didn't give a solution; you just solved this yourself."
