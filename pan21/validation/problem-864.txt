So do not think just because you are running it in a cygwin shell that you have any limited functionality.  Cygwin appears to be running right on top of a command shell within windows.
Cygwin is the best option here.  It keeps command history just like your unix shell does on a genuine unix box.  Something to be said about cygwin is that it supports all of the native shell commands that windows "knows and loves".  
You could always trying using Powershell.  All of the usual DOS commands are still supported, and if you use a script like this one you can make it preserve the command line history between sessions.
I'd suggest you to use Far manager on a daily basic (http://www.farmanager.com). So, in Far CTRL-E works as a switcher of previous commands, even from yesterday and the day before yesterday. 
As for the software, Far Manager is a long time successor of Norton Commander (or I'd say it was inspired by) created by the author of Rar compression utility. The stable version is a shareware, but even as a non-registered shareware quite useful. Also recently an open-source unicode version supported by a group of developers started. Far has a plugin system (for example WinSCP plugin from the author of WinSCP and tons of other plugins). It's a good replacement of cmd for any command-line operations (if you know or knew NC, you know what I mean) and from the other side the replacement of explorer if you prefer keyboard to mouse. I can't remember when I last time copied something with explorer or anything else :)
