In you android app get the scan list run decryption on the name (only your devices will succeed others will fail). extract SSID and psk. configure wpa_supplicant using the SSID and key.
I'm looking for a solution for configuring wifi in headless mode, the same way as IoT devices : when not known wifi in range, toggle to AP mode with a predefined SSID, run a small web-server to list available network, and provide inputs to enter network Key.
For your question I want to share what I have done for automatic network connection. You will have to develop a mobile app (in my case it was android).
Your project is more ambitious. I suggest you get WiFi working first, then you can work on AP. I doubt you will find a ready made solution.
The google coder project does exactly this and I've used it successfully to enter wifi credentials and connect a headless Raspi to a wireless network.
The following shows 3 ways of setting up WiFi, http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md
Te easiest is to set up using GUI, but if you follow the detailed instructions you can do via the command line. (I assume you propose to use Ethernet to setup.)
First, I gave each device a name and a psk. Then run an encryption on the name and get the generated SSID. Then configure this SSID through wpa_supplicant or hostapd.
If you want to setup an IoT like network; it will be very painful (a loads of work has to do to make it automate).
