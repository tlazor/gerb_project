On the encrypted drive you might consider creating the first partition as unencrypted with innocent stuff on it, so it's less obvious to somebody who uses the drive that it has any encrypted data.  Or you could use the "hidden volume" feature of the encryption software, if the software you choose has the feature and you're willing to deal with the extra complexity.
Second, you should enable separate user accounts for both yourself and her. This will ensure that your stuff will stay yours and her stuff will stay hers. Store all your pics and whatnot somewhere in your directories and you won't have to worry about anyone stumbling across anything with a bit of heat.
If you're really paranoid/worried about it, your only technical option is to backup the stuff you DO want to keep, format the drive, and reinstall your Operating System.
Also, I wouldn't trust answers saying delete everything but files known to be safe.  You will forget something that you will want later on.
This is overkill for a reasonable gf moving in (unless she's already let it known that's she's strong anti-spice)--just do the first step (if one spicy photo makes it through that was downloaded years earlier; she won't care too much).  However, if you wanted to do the same thing but for a different reason; say small children will be using the computer this makes sense.
Another option: Tell your G/F about them and explain yourself; if she leaves you, it wasn't meant to be.  Honesty is the foundation of every good relationship. ;)
First, I recommend that you follow the advice about using an image manager to find all your pictures and talk to her about the images you like.
I don't think you're going to find a piece of software that can automatically identify media files of a certain genre or content, unless they are expressly tagged as such. :)
