Yes, but let me add dynamic witness only protects from planned failovers or downtime. In your case, if 2 of the 3 nodes went down abruptly dynamic witness is not going to work and WSFC will come down( lack of quorum one node and FS witness is not greater than 50% of votes). The fact is simple, with sudden downtime registries are not updated to change witness dynamically hence dynamic witness is failed to perform its duties. Dynamic witness and quorum gives "last man standing" feature but subject to condition the nodes are gracefully shutdown
In my opinion , based on version of windows you have and especially using always on configuration i would recommend having a quorum configured. In your case its File share which seems OK or else you have the option of quorum drive witness.
No for 3 node cluster, assuming all nodes are voting, if one node goes down still you have 2 nodes(more than 50 % of votes/nodes) voting which is sufficient to keep WSFC up and running so WSFC will not come down if one of the node goes down.
