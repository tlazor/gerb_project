After trying all the suggestions on here, nothing seemed to work. But apparently, the issue has fixed itself. I don't know if it was a Windows Update that did it or what happened, but the issue is resolved and my search is working again. I did have updates that came through recently, so I can only assume one of those updates resolved. Recently KB4476976 came through and it seems to work after installing that, although, I didn't see anything specific in the KB notes that seemed to address the issue. Anyway, thanks for everyone's suggestions!
None of the solutions found on the internet worked for me (and I've googled for hours), but @harrymc's answer lead me on the right track, so let me expand on it.
In my case, the problem was in Cortana's settings store getting corrupted. Cortana is not just the assistant, but Windows search is integrated with it and you need to reset its data and related settings.
As a last resort, if this didn't work for you, you can create a new Windows user. The new user should have a working search and you can migrate your data there.
