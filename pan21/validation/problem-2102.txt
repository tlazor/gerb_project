Is there any way to reduce the volume levels? I'm debating purchasing a more expensive external sound card that has a volume knob that is independent of the windows system volume. 
In each case, even a windows volume setting of 1/100 is too loud. Using the same headphones on my macbook pro the lowest volume is MUCH lower.
Does the problem only occur with these particular headphones?  It's possible the headphones have their own volume controls, although I can't imagine it being that loud at level 1.
I have the exact same problem with usb headsets and it's been there for years. I don't expect a fix from windows any time soon.
Another thing to keep in mind is that sometimes there are multiple volume controls on windows depending on what's installed.  The sound card itself may have its own set of volume controls, so check for any programs related to the sound card. 
A workaround I use is to get a program called 'equalizer pro', which allowed you to adjust base volume up or down. This way, you can set it to -20db simply in notepad and the volume will be much lower for every program, making you effectively erase the issue.
