If someone does not come along with something similar to the NetBIOS over TCP/IP concept, then my personal opinion is that you are fine with using HOSTS files, and that is the way to go.
What I can say is that you could set up your Linux box to act as a DNS server, host your own DNS, and register your computers with that server; or you can simply continue to use HOSTS files. Lastly, someone very likely may come along and add another answer that tells you how to let Linux and Macs communicate without using DNS, similar to NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
This is what I believe is going on, and it may help you some. The first part is easy: You are trying to use DNS to ping workstations that are not registered in DNS anywhere, and your router/DNS server is returning its external IP address (I believe, and your answer to the question above will confirm this).
The second part is that if you compare two Windows workstations, when they don't register to a local DNS server, they use NetBIOS over TCP/IP to find each other. In your case, I am not sure if you have anything similar you can use as I am not a Linux or Mac guy, and if yo do, it is not currently in use.
