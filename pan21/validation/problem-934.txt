Word 2013 was crashing on me when trying to print to an HP Printer in Windows 7.  I set Word 2013 to run in compatibility mode and it resolved my crashing issues.  
I am kind of lost with this one. One recommendation I was told was to disable background printing... that is did not fix anything. I am 99% sure my Anti-Virus can be ruled out for Word (has major issue with Outlook 2013) I am running ESET NOD32 Anti-Virus 6.
In the printer driver go to Device settings -> Installable options -> Printer Status notification and select disable.
I attempted to update my printer driver since the school pushes a driver out from their server. But for some reason I am not able to change the driver my laptop will use, its greyed out. So either they are restricting something or I am not doing it right.
So... Other than the above I am out of idea and hoping someone can give me a clue. I am trying to avoid calling MS support at all costs since they will probably provide no help at all.
My MS-Word was crashing as soon I was pressing the Print button. I solved the problem by going to my Programs and features and removing a program called STATNOVAPDF which I had no idea what it was. I suggest you go there and scroll down the list and try to find programs that don't seem useful or that could cause problem. Hope this helps.
Right click on Word 2013, Click Properties, Click Compatibility tab, check Run this Program in compatibility mode for, then click the drop down box and choose Windows xp service pack 2
I am having issues with MS Word 2013 crashing when I try to print something at my school. The reason I say only at my school is because it appear to work at my home where I have a HP Deskjet printer. The school has HP LaserJets (4250 I think).
