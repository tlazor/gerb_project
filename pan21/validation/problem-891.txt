The standard practice I've been using for Windows file server since Windows 2000 (laid out in Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows Server series, so look there for more info) is to use groups that are local to the file server itself for nesting.
TechNet Webcast: Windows Server 2003 Administration Series (Part 4 of 12): Group Management (Level 200)
This does add an additional layer to your groups management, but it has the benefit of allowing (say) site-local admins to manage their own file servers without needing anything more than Admin rights to that file server.  If you have a federated sort of branch office structure, where every office kind of does its own thing with its servers, this can be a real benefit.  You may not want to have to give AD admin rights to a few dozen local site admins.
2) I would STRONGLY re-evalute the need for Universal groups for everything as you take a replication hit with them as the members and groups inside of the Universal group is replicated to the Global Catalog servers while with Domain Local and Global only the group is replicated to the global catalog servers. So if you make a change in a universal group it kicks off a replication, while with global and domain local it does not.
It also keeps your AD from being cluttered with a lot of groups (one group per access level per share per server can add up very quickly), and minimizes group replication between GCs.  It allows you to reserve your AD groups for roles instead of permissions.
The downside of using Domain Local Groups for resources is that you end up with more total groups.  The upside is that you have less of a problem with replication, as Zypher noted. 
If your environment is rigorously standardized and all file servers are identical and replicated, then this is obviously one more layer of groups you don't need.  Also, if you know you need a particular AD group to have the same rights on a share that exists on every single file server, you're going to need some automation to maintain that.
Because these are local groups, you can put whatever other groups or users you want in them - domain local groups, global groups, universal groups, user accounts from any domain in your forest.  Rights management is now local to the file server's groups rather than the file system or the AD.
Create groups local to KERMIT for access and give them permissions on the file system exactly as you've specified (i.e. one group per access level per share)
In a nutshell, the more different your file servers are from each other, the more using machine local groups makes sense.  The more they are similar, the more you want to use the system you are currently using.
1) I would add to your "roles" scheme by evaluating what they need across servers not on just one server you are probably going to run into outliers to this, but my theory with those is when you run into them, create another group. in my experience where there is one outlier there are many.  
Your method of using resource group for each access level is correct.  The only thing I would consider is using Domain Local Groups for resources.  You don't necessarily need to use Universal Groups if you're creating server-specific resource groups.  
That approach isn't bad.  As a rule never use individual users to add permissions- use a group.  Groups can however be used across resources. Eg HR might have RW access to files while MANAGERS might have R.  You can also set up Access Based Enumeration.  Take a look at the following webcast:
