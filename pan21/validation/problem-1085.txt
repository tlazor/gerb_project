I think your question makes the invalid assumption that it is Microsoft's job to add support for a particular vendor's 2FA/MFA solution.  But there are plenty of 2FA/MFA products that already support Windows and AD because the vendors have chosen to add that support. If Google doesn't think it's important enough to add support, that's not really Microsoft's fault. The Authentication and Authorization related APIs are well documented and free to use.
In any case, no. I don't believe Google Authenticator support will explicitly be be supported in Windows Server 2016. But I don't think anything is preventing Google from adding support themselves on Server 2016 or earlier.
While we do not like the operational cost of DUO, for up to 50 users, the cost, to us, is worth the simplicity to set up and use.
The blog post you linked to sample code that anyone could write to add RFC6238 TOTP support to their own AD FS environment.  That it happens to work with Google Authenticator is just a side effect of the authenticator supporting that RFC. I would also note the litany of disclaimers at the bottom about the code being "proof of concept", "no proper error handling", and "not created with safety in mind".
There is allready a free pluging for One time password authentication with ADFS . It works fine with google or microsoft authenticator apps. See www.securemfa.com for more information. I'm using it without any issues in production.
We continue to believe that AD itself should support the TOTP/HOTP RFC's behind google authenticator, and are deeply disappointed that MS has not solved this properly in Windows Server 2016.
We are not aware of any other approach that can be set up in 2-4 hours and MFA enable LDAP services that hang off AD.
