P.S. I must say, though, that ideally, if the remote 2008 R2 instance is the shared Dev / QA / Production server, then the local instance should also be 2008 R2 so that you are developing on the same environment as you are deploying to :-).
In this particular case, there was a difference between the two instances: the remote instance is actually SQL Server 2008 R2, not 2016. Also, the instance-level default Collation was different between the two instances.
In this particular case, the "Target Platform" was set to "2008 R2", and changing it to "2016" resolved the issue for publishing locally. Of course, it is quite likely that the DDL generated for SQL Server 2016 will cause some errors in 2008 R2, though that could be in just the "create" script and not an issue for incremental deployment scripts. It still might be necessary to enable the "Allow Incompatible Platform" option. If there are issues with "2016" being the "Target Platform" for also publishing to the 2008 R2 instance, then you might need separate SSDT Publishing Profiles.
