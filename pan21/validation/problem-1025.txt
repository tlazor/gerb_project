probably the ftp server process does not have the right to write to c:. Try c:\somedir\somefile.txt instead
 Now double click it. To open>see, read or play and edit a folder or its file you need to drag>copy or move it to desktop. You can move it back when you are done.
ftp.log will capture the output. Adding the 2>&1 means you capture both standard out (normal output) and standard error (any error messages from ftp.exe). 
This is probably because FTP.exe take control over the shell. So redirections, that are handled by the cmd.exe have no effect.
What you can do, is use the -s:filename option and redirect the whole ftp output to a file. It will contain more then you want, but you can take care of that later.
The simplest way is open Computer folder where you see all your drives. Here you need to create a shortcut for ftp server. To do this, on empty space in computer folder right click and click on 'Add a network location' click on it and follow the prompt to create shortcut for your network ftp server. If you have password for it or is anonymous do that. You can give it a name too. It will appear in Network location on Computer folder.
