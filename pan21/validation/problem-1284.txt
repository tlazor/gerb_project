If your landlord is using these for providing network connectivity - odds are the building used to be used for a business.  If this has always been a residential building - your landlord probably got them cheap (and a very long time ago judging by the dicoloration and dust build up!)
These can also be used for Internet etc as they take standard 8-pin RJ45 connectors - the only difference between use for the internet and use for Building Management systems is what the other end of the cable is plugged into!
Yes they can be used to connect to your router - providing you can find the other end of the cable behind that face plate and its patched somewhere suitably.
While they don't differ from a tradition network in terms fo the cabling used, the types of heads on the cables etc - often, when true IBDN is used - the patching at the other end of the cables behind these ports goes into a completely separate patch panel/switch speifically segregated to keep building monitoring away from other services which use networking technologies.  Think of it as a separate building management network.
