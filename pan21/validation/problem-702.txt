FTP would be a good choice as on the server side you could set up scripts to manage your files as required.  Your clients would be able to access the files using most web browsers or even Windows Explorer.  You can password protect your ftp folders, which gives some security, however, the file transfers would be in the clear.  Also, many corporate environments block FTP.  But this would be the simplest and most flexible route.

This is an old question but the class of application that the OP is looking for is called "Managed File Transfer". There are lots of vendors in this space. All of these run on Linux: 
If you require secure transfer of your files, then WebDav gives a similar end user experience, but you can securely transfer files over HTTPS, and http and https are less likely to be blocked by your clients.

A general purpose FTP client could be quite an easy solution. User management could probably be easily automated around your FTP server with a few scripts ...
