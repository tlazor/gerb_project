As such, your best option would be to use FileVault 2. You may as well encrypt your entire drive rather than just the VM, though Wikipedia notes this incurs a performance penalty of approximately 20-30% vs no encryption. But as it is using native CPU instructions to do this encryption and there's no virtualisation at this step, it's all but certainly going to be your fastest option.
I cannot speak to git, but I found that cvs was horrendously slow on both OSX's HFS+ and on Windows's NTFS. Both file systems were horrendously bad at managing lots of small files. This was not a problem on Linux with reiserfs (now I'm dating myself) or ext3. It's also not a problem with git on my current Linux VM running ext4. My point is that git may be slow because of NTFS rather than because you are virtualising the operating system. Lousy filesystems (NTFS, HFS+) may certainly be one or two orders of magnitude slower for other source control systems.
The 2013 MBP uses Intel Core i7. That CPU provides hardware-accelerated AES encryption via the AES-NI, which is used by Apple's FileVault 2 (page 5).
As an aside, make sure you are allocating enough but not too much RAM for your Windows 7 VM. If you are hitting swap (in the host or the guest VM), you'll kill performance.
