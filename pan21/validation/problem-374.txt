Also... your TTL is 3 hours (10800... seconds;) in the "old times" that was OK... in my dns servers  I use no more than 30 minutes, with not a terrible load on the server :)
The simplest method is to use the $ORIGIN directive twice, combined with @ to reference the current origin:
You need different left-hand-side labels to support the prefixed names for production and staging.  As written there's no way to distinguish m etc between the two, because you've created two entries for m.domain.org, etc.
(your can see that you defined api, m, and www twice pointing to different places... when you read these syntax, api by itself --and not dot after it, really reads api.mydomain.org... when you have api.staging --not dot at the end, what you are "saying" is api.staging.mydomain.org.)
I've got separate physical production servers and staging servers and I'd like domain.org to point to production, and staging.domain.org to point to the staging server + have m/www/api prefixes for each server.
My domain provider's config tool doesn't seem to support what I'm trying to do and I'm unsure of the proper BIND syntax for the below - any pointers appreciated!
