I would double up on my efforts to design and build a time machine. Once that project was complete I would go back to late last week and smack myself around the head until I:
And, ofcourse if you cannot afford backup hosting, you can use file system that have proved tools for recovery. I suggest NTFS for valuable "backups".
You can modify your website, so when you create some post in blog it will automatically create this post on backup site (complete site mirror on other hosting, free hosting such as Google AppEngine, or your developer machine â€” but inaccessible for ordinal internet users). When your main hosting lose all data you can just copy it from backup hosting (and no changes in DB or site structure needed!). When your hosting is down you can just modify DNS record for your domain name with IP of backup site (and eventually change some access permissions on backup site).
In the absense of success in the TimeMachine project, all I would be able to do was wait patiently for the host to do what they could and hope that their backup arrangements were sufficient such that the data (or at least a recent copy there-of) can be restored in a short amount of time. I would then make sure that the above mentioned plans were made, implemented and regularly tested.
If the host really wants to play ball and be nice they'd immediately freeze any usage of the disks in question and get them to a data recovery specialist... but in reality thats never gonna happen.
I tar and mysqldump all my hosting data to disk, then move it to a bigger RAID-type disk. I have never deleted a single copy of a backup. Yes, it takes up tons of disk space, but I value my user's data more than my own life! (Little exaggerated there, but I see it as my responsibility to make sure there is data integrity.)
