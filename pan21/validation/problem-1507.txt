and this goes to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.2\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf 
I got up and running a reverse proxy on apache2 under Linux (Ubuntu). Now i see that there is a different folder-structure under Windows. 
As John has alluded to, the default configuration for Apache installed on Windows is at Program Files\Apache2.2\httpd.conf in a flat file. The path may be somewhat different, as I don't have a Windows machine handy at the moment. Most Linux distributions have their own custom hierarchical structure which looks something like the following. This example is from Debian and may vary with other distributions.
I've described all this to hopefully make it easier to understand how to replicate it under Windows. With the exception that links are not well supported under Windows (has this changed in Vista/Server 2008/Windows 7?) it's relatively easy to set this structure up. But you will have to do it manually, since the default configuration doesn't do it for you. Make sure you adjust the following to match the Linux distribution you're migrating from.
It is realy simple if you know where to put the parameters because the standard folder structure after standard-setup is different for apache2.2 on ubuntu 8.04 and windows2008.
