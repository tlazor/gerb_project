automatic solution, no user imput required (well, some notice where it was actually printed would be nice) ? I tried to google for some solution, but most I've found was for Windows 2000, that scared me a little :)
If it were me, I'd have a poke around with an open-source IP-based load balancer.  HAproxy springs to mind.  
Third party software tools such as Print Queue Manager by SoftwareShelf can do this for you.  But I'm unaware of a built-in tool to handle this.  Simkill's idea of a printer pool is the closest but with load-balancing like that you need the printers in the same place.  So you can definitely go the printer pool route if you want to simply pick up two more printers and stick 2 printers at Location A and two at Location B.
Perhaps LinuxVirtualServer (LVS) might be a better fit, where you can have traffic going to one or the other.  Not sure.  Pretty sure that the answer is L3 load-balancing/failover somewhere along the line, though.
It might not work at all (if I had a couple of printers, I'd try this idea out), but at least you'll have tried something out. 
You can create a printer pool of identical printers. Users print to the pool and the print comes out where ever is least busy. If a printer fails, it will print to whichever is available. You can find more information here http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc757086(v=ws.10).aspx
The advantage of using something like HAProxy is that you don't have to buy any additional software/hardware (maybe).  It'll run happily on a VM (1GB, 1Core, Ubuntu) or similar.. 
Set it up for straight-up TCP load balancing, and configure a check to see if the printer is responding.
It occurs to me that you'd want to use weighted round-robin, and set the weight to 100 and 1 so that it would preferentially print to one or the other - because what you don't want is half a print job going to one, and the other half going to the other.
problem - Xerox 7120 was not a good choice for us and is very maintenance intense, causing problems and outages. People have to be informed to use the other printer while the first one is offline, and BFU is yelling, that "it is too complicated" to choose another printer from the menu ...
Most printers are happy enough using TCP/9100 (Thanks HP and JetDirect), but  you might also want to load-balance the traffic on TCP/631 (Internet Printing Protocol) if your drivers require that.
situation - small network of 25 PC windows 7, two network (connected via network cable, dedicated fixed IP address) printers (Xerox WorkCenter 7120). Office divided in two parts, each part has its own printer, so people dont have to stand up and make more than ten steps to get their papers :)
