What identifies a student in the reality you are supposed to be modelling? It seems that Matriculation Number identifies a student, i.e. Matricularion Number is your "natural key" for students.
A surrogate key won't help you achieve these things. Adding arbitrary numbers to things doesn't make them any "more unique" than they were before.
I would go with the surrogate key approach. I'm not familiar with matriculation number, but i expect it to be large enough so that having a surrogate integer might be the preferred alternative. Having a larger PK, means larger indexes, which means less performance for reads and writes, plus more space usage, and more space for referring tables too.
One thing for sure is that a surrogate key does not identify a student. From a data integrity and usability point of view what is important is that the uniqueness of Matriculation Number is assured (by making it UNIQUE and NOT NULL) and that the required dependencies on Matriculation Number are properly implemented to avoid potential anomalies and incorrect data. For example, I assume that {Matriculation Number} -> {firstname, lastname, email} and therefore to satisfy BCNF the Matriculation Number should be a key of a table containing those attributes.
