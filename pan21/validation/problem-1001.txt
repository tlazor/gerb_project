The official "securing your pi" guide from the Raspberry Pi foundation recommends installing the "uncomplicated firewall" (ufw) and adding a rule to deny access to port 30 from 192.168.2.1:
The guide doesn't give any justification for this recommendation and my googling hasn't turned up anyone else recommending blocking this port or anything about risky protocols that communicate on port 30. The only info I have found is that it looks like some splinter cell games communicate over port 30 and that 192.168.2.1 is often a default address for routers.
The specific code your question is about (sudo ufw deny from 192.168.2.1 port 30) is only one general example for how to "Deny access to port 30 from IP address 192.168.2.1". Like @Milliways already commented, this is not a (mandatory) recommendation. You will not necessarily end up with an insecure device if you do not block port 30 for the given IPv4 address. If you need to block a different IPv4 address and maybe a different port number, now you know how to do it using ufw:
The documentation could be more clear about this and point out, that this code is just an example. If you want, use the link in the documenations footer and help to improve it: View/Edit this page on GitHub.
