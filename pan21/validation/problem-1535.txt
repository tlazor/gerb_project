Have at least one monitor sideways ("portrait" as opposed to "landscape"). Editing source code and documents on a sideways monitor gives you more of an overview of your work.
I find it very useful to keep my main work on the primary monitor (19" widescreen) and all the preipheral stuff (e.g. mail, webbrowser, musicplayer) on my second monitor. It keeps your attention to your work, but you can still view in one glance if there is something that desires your attention.
AAlso, since I am a Delphi programmer, I keep my code on the primary monitor and all dbugging windows on the secondary. This keeps my area in which to view code large and has the added advantage that during debugging I can see both the debugging windows as well as the application I am working on.
Consider the upgrade to Windows 7 which has more builtin support, but if that isn't an option, there's a good list of techniques and applications here
It also offers functions to position windows on just one screen which also works for single but big monitors.
