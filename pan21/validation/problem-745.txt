I find this works fairly well when people bother to use it (I sometimes get annoyed with conversations that go: "What is the VPN password for X? It is in keypass. Oh, what address do I need for the SQL server at that end? Check keypass. And the SQL user/pass? All in keypass. OK. And what about the web server?...").
We have a keepass datafile (to which those of us with authorisation have a keyfile) which stores the relevant credentials, in a small source control project. Extra detail is sometimes kept in the keypass notes field(s), or if it is more than something as small as a couple of IP addresses (and the information is not sensitive) such the detail is in small documents (a text file usually) along with a couple of documents in that same project.
We also use a wiki as a knowledge database (I would recommend doku-wiki) and trac as a ticket-system.
There is another keepass database with more sensitive details in, that less people have access too. Depending on the size of your operation and the nature of your clients you may need to break things down much more finely than we do.
Just make sure you encrypt documents to yourself (in case the client loses their key),  in addition to whoever needs access.
Set up a basic wiki and pgp/gpg-encrypt the document/documents with such info.  Set the client(s) up with the FireGPG firefox plugin.  You can even mix inline encrypted sections into a plain-text wiki page and it'll take care of decrypting it for you.
