Depending on how much data is being backed up (full/incremental), I'd say use the tape to backup critical day-to-day business operations files, emails, whatever and keep rotating that tape offsite. Tape still has a very good lifespan (and storage capacity) and while HDDs/NAS devices are much faster and readily available, tape's main advantage over them is portability. I would say in terms of reliability that tapes need to be tested on a regular basis. I've had tapes go bad and by making it a point to always test tapes as part of my routine, I haven't had any issues with tape since.
While I currently use NAS and have had to use tape backup (Bacula/Amanda/BackupExec) for work, tape is a necessity if for only the ability to move the tape offsite and into a facility like a safe deposit box or give to a vendor like IronMountain. If the office is robbed or burns down to the ground, now what good is a hard drive/NAS then?
Personally I trust tapes for long term storage more than I trust hard drives. Also, unless my math is wrong, The cost to store data on tapes is much cheaper than hard drives. I can store up to 400GB of compressed data on an LTO2 tape for $35.00 while an external hard drive with that capacity will cost roughly twice that.
The one caveat to tape of course is cloud storage but that involves bandwidth, security, privacy, a large amount of trust, etc. etc. - issues that are probably out of scope for your question.
Hard drives work fine, That is what I use. The only down side is they are fragile and will fail faster than a tape. Make sure you don't put all of your eggs in one basket, and you should be fine.
