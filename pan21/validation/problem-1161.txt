I started my Windows XP virtual machine and now I want it to join the domain on Windows Server 2012, but I don't know how am I supposed to do it since both the machines are virtual and not connected to each other using any switch or anything.
Now I setup the Domain Controller in Windows Server 2012 with the domain name testServer.com, and also setup the DHCP server.
Now, I configured Windows Server's own IPv4 address as, 192.168.10.201 and preferred DNS server is the same IP address.
I have downloaded and installed Windows Server 2012 in VMWare and also installed Windows XP Professional. 
In our University lab, everything is setup with different virtual machines connected to each other, And I am trying to create the same scenario at home since most of the required Windows are free for us to download and use.
I am confused here, if I have changed Windows Server IP configuration, doesn't that mean that it is not connected to the VMWare NAT network anymore ?
Both the machines are setup in VMWare Workstation with the network connection type of VMware as NAT.
