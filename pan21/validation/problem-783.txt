Your character is shifting between a speed of +5 and -5 between frames, causing the flashing. I'm not sure what kind of effect you are looking for, so solutions may vary.
(Note: since you are adding 1 to speed every frame, the rate the character accelerates at will be frame rate dependant, meaning it'll only work as expected at a certain fixed frame rate. Fixing it is beyond the scope of this question, but essentially you'd want to make acceleration/speed a function of time, to have your game work at slower or faster frame rates)
Get the idea? Make collision detection and resolution independent of input, to minimize strange behaviour. The above still isn't perfect (what if the player is moving so fast, they end up moving through a wall, for example), but it's a start. If you want to do some reading on collision detection, look up AABB collision, it's one of the most basic and effective methods for simple collision detection.
Now you've got your input function. Next, an update function. Here is where you actually move the player, and check for collisions. I haven't programmed in Java for a while, so I apologize for any errors in syntax:
