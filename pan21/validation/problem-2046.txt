The most used way is to install an OS on the laptop disk (e.g. partition the disk, create two volumes. Usually C:\ and D:. Then the host OS gets installed to C: and D: gets used for storage (e.g. movies, your documents, VM images, ...).
However you did not post if partition 1 was near the outside of the disk and partition 2 was near the inside. Or vice versa. Nor do all disks work the same. 
And without that information on your disk and how your partitioned the disk there is no way to answer your question except with a 'Yes, maybe'.
This more passing surface means more passing information to read (faster) or write (faster). That makes the outer tracks of your disk faster.
Most disk come with multiple platters and R/W heads at both side of the disk. And there are multiple ways to allocate sectors. Some simply start at the inside off all platters and move outwards. Some may start at the outside and move inward (which means for some sector #1 might be fastest and for other the highest sector may be fastest). Then there are at least a few disks which use platter for platter, creating a saw-tooth performance curve.
A rotating disk at a fixed RPM has more disk surface pass below the Read/write had per second on the outside than on the inside. This is easy to see if you mentally rotate the disk in the picture below. If you keep your finger (or the R/W head) near the green ring then more surface will pass your finger in one rotation than if you rotate it with your finger near the red line.
If this is also the case with your laptop then you should just stores the virtual disk on D: to keep things simple and clean.
