Creating an index only on timestamp column seems like a waste of resources (2 out of three columns of entire table will be included in an index), but actually it's very common for size of all indexes be greater than the size of the table. Slow queries are also wasting a lot of resources, so just create it if it'll boost select queries and if slower inserts will not be a problem. 
So you are gaining nothing and only wasting space when you create a new index and slowing down inserts as timestamp order still will have to be maintained. 
To finally answer your question: as you can't implement this logic using indexes and constraints, the only way I see is to create an INSTEAD OF INSERT Trigger. It'll hurt insert performance, but prior to insert you can check if older timestamp already exists in the table and then modify the timestamp, not insert the data, raise an error - up to you.  
You can create a clustered index on both id and timestamp columns and even define different sorting order for each column if you want to:
