We had an issue with our ISP and the tool Ping Plotter came in very helpful.  You can set it to ping a router at the ISP's internet gateway, or in our example we told it to ping from a regional office back to the corporate office.  In this example, it was going through a couple different ISPs.  Best of all you can set it up on an old desktop or a virtual machine, and let is sit there pinging away collecting data until you need it.
Try pinging any Outbound website. If you can do so, everything is fine within you network. Contact your ISP.
Things I check when troubleshooting a network issue with a provider. Note here that 'ping' means 'do an extended ping, sweeping a range of sizes, and sending at least 1000 packets at each size, looking for latency, loss and errors'.
There is a wonderful, simple to use tool on linux called MTR (short for My Trace Route) which will show you packet loss at every step of the route, and can even help you hunt down flapping routes.
Because it shows each router in the path, and the time it takes each one of those routers to return a response it is very useful to spotting trouble spots further downstream.
If step 3 fails, there would appear to be a problem in your provider's network. Note, though, that if you get no response at all then your ISP may have simply blocked ICMP to/from their infrastructure addresses.
