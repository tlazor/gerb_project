It entirely depends on the make of the slots and the physical size of the slots which equates to the lanes actually traveling to the slots as explained at hardwareSecrets.com. 
In theory you should use the x16 slot in single card and x16 (in x8 mode) + x8 for SLI. That said, the maximum theoretical bandwidth of PCIe 3.0 is twice that of PCIe 2.0, and most cards would work fine on the latter. What you've found seems backed up by other sources too - gamersnexus found the same results in their tests, and puget systems (who build gaming rigs) found oddly inconsistant results
Assuming that the PCI version for each of slots is the same (which optimally will match your graphics card) and that the lanes connected are not deceptive to the size of the slot - they should hold the same performance minus whatever (practically theoretical) difference there would exist from different length of the wires used.
Practically speaking, the main advantage of the x16 lane should be geography, especially with a 3 slot card. A well designed motherboard would not block any other usable ports.
No one's ever tested PCIe/videocards on x4, and those should use the smaller connectors anyway. There's no way I see plugging a video card into a standard, non open ended slot to be possible.
