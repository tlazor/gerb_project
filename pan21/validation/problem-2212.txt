We've started having Trustwave do monthly PCI network vulnerability scans. The last couple months we've passed, but this month it failed for "Scan Interference Detected." This is their recommendation:
I'm not exactly sure how to whitelist them. I set up a couple address objects in the WAN zone, but I'm not sure what to apply it to. I tried turning off "Stealth Mode" (due to an associated complaint of over 60,000 open ports, which is impossible) and I even went as far as to turn off IPS (I turned off protection but left on detection because I don't want to leave us totally exposed). However, the scans are still failing.
I've opened a support ticket with them, but the first guy I talked to had no idea what to do other than reading the same information I already had, and I'm waiting for a call back from their "scanning team." I'm hoping someone here has already figured this out on a Sonicwall and can help me better.ï»¿
I ended up fixing this problem by switching to a different company. SecurityMetrics had no trouble with our network. (And I never did hear back from Trustwave with anything helpful.)
It does seem a bit ridiculous to turn off security in order to test security, but apparently that's now a normally accepted thing for PCI scans.
