Does your data have filters? If so, select header row with filters, then remove all filters (right click, Filter, clear filter). Then select header row again, and add filters back. After doing so I was able to sort my data and all columns sorted. Hope this helps!
Excel automatically tries to find your total data range, and it stumbles over blank fields. So if your cursor is in a line where there a blank fields in some columns, Excel could miss the columns behind the blanks fields (and similar for blank rows). This is still true when you chose 'extend'.
I recommend the Autofilter solution if it doesn't bother you otherwise, as it makes sure that you don't accidentally sort some day a part only because you forgot to do 2. or 3.
In my case it was because I had empty hidden columns between the content columns and for some reason Excel was considering them as some sort of separator. For example if I clicked Ctrl + A while having a cell selected, it would only select the columns between the nearest empty columns.
One solution is to 1. use Autofilters, that will make Excel remember what is in your range; another is to 2. put the cursor in a field where there are no blank fields in the row (and column); a third way is to 3. select the whole range yourself; and of course, the problem goes away if you 4. don't have blank cells anywhere.
